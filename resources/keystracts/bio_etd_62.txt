lysine ligand binding conformational transitions fluorescence reporter group extrinsic probe the previous procedure for the isolation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd from leuconostoc mesenteroides was modified to allow the preparation of large quantities of homogeneous enzyme suitable for structural studies the enzyme was shown to consist of two identical subunits containing n-terminal valine and c-terminal glycinethree aspects were examined that probe the relationship between structure and function of l mesenteroides g6pd first the enzyme was covalently labelled with a phosphopyridoxyl group at a unique lysine residue previous work had suggested that this lysine is located at the active site and that it participates in binding g6p milhausen and levy eur j biochem 50 1975 453-461 two pyridoxyl peptides diia and diib were isolated from the tryptic digest of the modified enzyme the amino acid sequence of each peptide revealed that the sequence of the pyridoxyl binding site was phe-leu-leu-lyspxy-ser-pro-ser-tyr-asp val-lys this is the first report of sequence information from the active site of any g6pdsupport for the role of the modified lysine is provided in the second part of this dissertation in which three fluorescent probes were exploited to provide information on ligand binding and conformational transitions that the enzyme undergoesfirst the intrinsic protein fluorescence was quenched by binding various ligands to the enzyme these measurements permitted the monitoring of overall conformational changes of the enzyme upon ligand binding and calculation of binding constantssecond the covalently bound phosphopyridoxyl group in the modified enzyme served as a fluorescence reporter group to monitor the conformational changes produced by nad' or nadp' and to calculate their binding constants the results of these experiments showed that pyridoxylation promotes a conformational change similar to that produced by nad' or g6p see below binding of nad' to pyridoxyl enzyme is accompanied by a smaller conformational change than that seen when it binds to the native enzyme conversely nadp' binding leads to a larger conformational change in the pyridoxylated than in the native enzyme this was supported by the fact that the dissociation constant for nad' is lower and for nadp' is higher for pyridoxyl enzyme than for native enzymethird the fluorescence of s-nadph was used as an extrinsic probe of the coenzyme binding region of the enzyme the fluorescence properties of s-nadph are reported for the first time
