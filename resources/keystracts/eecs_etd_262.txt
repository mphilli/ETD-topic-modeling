computer graphics interactive shape design during the past decade large design and production industries have been exploring efficient computer-aided design cad methods for the controlled generation of free-form curve and surface shapes their goal is to obtain a mathematical model of a particular object to be used in its manufacturing process this dissertation addresses itself to one such mathematical scheme for interactive shape design on a computer graphics display the approach differs from the traditional in that a mathematical model is produced during definition of the design object this ab initio design situation avoids the inaccurate and costly procedure of first producing a physical model and then attempting to fit a mathematical model to it
