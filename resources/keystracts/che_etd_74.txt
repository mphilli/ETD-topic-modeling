grignard reagents organometallic earth metals potassium rubidium cesium despite considerable efforts being given to organometallic complexes of lithium and magnesium grignard reagents the amount of information available for the heavier alkali congeners potassium rubidium and cesium and the alkaline earth metals calcium strontium and barium are much more poorly understood even as the heavy organoalkali organometallics have become a standard in synthesis as a result of superbase chemistry understanding of bonding and solid-state structure and behavior of these compounds remains murkysimilarly the chemistry of the alkaline earth metals particularly -bonded organometallic species remains poorly developed and structural information on such compounds was nonexistent until very recently especially considering the surprising tendency for heavy alkaline earth metal compounds to display unexpected geometries that defy standard vsepr models it is critical to create as large a library as possible for these compounds to assist in further investigationsin this work an array of contact and charge separated heavy alkali and alkaline earth organometallics are presented in addition two powerful new synthetic routes--hydrocarbon elimination and desilylation--are made available as new entries into these compounds synthetic aspects and structural details are discussed and theoretical studies are conducted in an attempt to elucidate some of the interesting questions encountered in this field
