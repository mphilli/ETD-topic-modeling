symbol-systems christian culture religion metaphor among many symbol-systems of the christian culture perhaps one of the least likely survivors is the tarot yet it has endured for five centuries without a protective cult or literary framework speculation upon the sources and functions are largely fruitless and based upon preconceived notions except that the tarot pack appeared in fifteenth-century italy as a game of playing cardsthe excessive claims that have been made for its pictures generate a cluster of issues concerning the nature of religion and culture these issues are first and fundamentally if as huizinga and others have suggested play is the primary element in the formation of culture those arts and artifacts designated as playful may reveal deep and pervasive religious aspects of their cultural tradition second and following those playthings are the texts of the culture revealing how what is real is what is read and particularly the ways in which sacred text is created and carried third and ultimately both play and sacred text are aspects of metaphor this study is not an attempt to create a theory of play text or metaphor rather it is to use the tarot as an example which is paradigmatic of thesethe tarot serves in this study to illuminate the issues of play text and metaphor in our on-going search into the complex of religion and culturegame--or play--discloses metaphor by means of metaphor the introduction establishes some metaphorical qualities of game and text and characterized by the foolish interplay between iconoclasm and re-mythologizing by the wit of error in designating the correspondence between game and the sacred and by playing the most commonly applied game of tarot that of seeking its false origins the common metaphorical base or dynamic is establishedthe figure of the fool in the tarot pack the paradoxical figure of sacred and secular literature illuminates that metaphorical perspective which includes the primary concerns of the study moreover the fool and the feminine exemplify the boundary figures which do the work of iconoclastic imagination utilizing the tarot as a paradigm of sacred text and defining some of the elements of text it is argued as that which hides and reveals remembers and invents divines and interprets all through story and all through charting the necessity of deviance--of error
