corealloy morphological evolutions nanoparticles optical properties processing in this thesis i describe the synthesis and processing of corealloy nanoparticles nps from the two major perspectives optical properties and morphological evolutions in chapter 2 i take advantage of atomic interdiffusion at nanoparticle interfaces to fabricate auauxag1-x corealloy and auauxag1-xag corealloyshell nanoparticles the alloy formation and subsequent interdiffusion allowed us to tailor nanoparticle composition and ultrastructure as well as surface plasmon response spr the resulting surface plasmon resonance signatures were modeled as a function of alloy or monometallic shell thickness as well as alloy composition using the discrete dipole approximation dda methodin chapter 3 i discusse the synthesis of auauxag1-xag nanoparticles nps further in terms of the effects of temperatures and reducing agents temperature range from th  90 - 215 oc and the reducing agents--ascorbic acid and sodium borohydride were examinedin chapter 4 i investigate the internal composition and microstructure of plasmonic corealloy nanoparticles nps by comparing changes in spr signature in depth with dda simulations depending on the processing temperature alloying occurs at the coreshell interface the extent of alloying was related to changes in the spr using dda in conjunction with tem determined morphology we are able to determine alloy shell composition x and thickness ts through a series of corealloy models with x  02 - 08 and shell thickness to core radius ratios tsrc of 005 - 10 using this approach we are able to produce a variety of spr rich features which can reproduce the experimental resultsin chapter 5 i describe the sulfidation of auag coreshell and auauxag1-x corealloy nanoparticles nps where interesting diffusion process and morphological changes upon sulfidation are shown the sulfidation leads to the formation auag2s asymmetric heterodimers with a janus-like geometryin chapter 6 i explore the oxidation properties of fefexcr1-x corealloy nps with stainless steel like interfaces these particles show a unique morphological transformation that is induced by surface oxidation oxide passivation and vacancy coalescence in chapter 7 i describe the preliminary results that are based on the further processing of core-void-shell morphologies described in chapter 6
