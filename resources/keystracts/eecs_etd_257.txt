computer science combinatorial configurations symmetrical balanced incomplete block design heuristic searching backtrack searching hill-climbing searching the existence of certain classes of combinatorial configurations has been in doubt for decades with the advent of the modern computer a small number of these configurations have been constructed using exhaustive search techniques even with the major advances in computer technology only a new more cases could be solved using traditional methods in this paper a new approach to the construction of these configurations using nonenumerative search techniques is introduced
