parity-violating asymmetry polarized electrons protons strange form factors we have measured the parity violating asymmetry with polarized electrons scattered elastically from protons the result is a   -1505  098 stat    056 syst   ppm at the kinematic point [left angle bracket][straight theta]  lab   [right angle bracket]  123 and [left angle bracket] q  2  [right angle bracket]  0477  gevc   2   the value for the linear combination of the strange form factors found using a  is [special characters omitted]  0392[special characters omitted]  0025  0020  0014 where the first error is experimental and the second stems from the uncertainties in the electromagnetic form factors
