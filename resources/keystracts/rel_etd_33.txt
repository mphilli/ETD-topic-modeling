saint anselm of canterbury violent christian atonement new testament key western theories of christ's death on the cross have been worked out in terms of exchange brought about by violence the most influential example is that of anselm of canterbury 1033-1109 that christ's death made satisfaction tofor god's offended honor mimetic anthropology based in the work of ren girard provides a powerful deconstructive tool in regard to such doctrine it demonstrates the inherent quotient of violence in the logic used producing a divine hypostasis of violence application of this analysis to concrete episodes of the medieval period further locates the anselmian text in a frame where violence is constitutive of cultural practice meaning and symbolsan alternative tradition exists--that compassion of the crucified is the most persuasive account of the cross of christ radicalized mimetic anthropology--understanding the self as already a version or repetition of the other--enables us to describe this compassion as solidarity in suffering and at an abyssal level this means that non-retaliation and forgiveness provide an alternative self to and for the violence profoundly shaping relationality that they do so at a level beneath all phenomenality of violence and that such explanation in and of itself lacks metaphysical necessity it is the qualitative uncertainty of com-passion that is its only warrant to alter violence this account is therefore intrinsically rhetorical illustrated consistently both by the philosophical aporia of repetition and by particular exempla drawn from world literature and yet it is also historical rooted in the particular and contingent a hermeneutic of the new testament rejects exchangist notions of christ's death highlighting rather the apocalyptic content which fits the interruptive nature of the cross and gives credibility to a contingent intentionality in the historical jesus in this light the conclusion detects in christ's abyssal com-passion the re-creative quality of new time both for god and humanity obviating need for systematic accounts incorporating both violence and non-violence in the one god
