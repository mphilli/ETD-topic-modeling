coherent sheaves chow group degeneracy locus thom-porteous formula given a morphism  of vector bundles e   and  f  of rank e  and f  respectively over a purely n  -dimensional  scheme x   a nonnegative integer k   min e    f   and a degeneracy  locus[special characters omitted] satisfying certain conditions the  thom-porteous formula gives the fundamental class of the degeneracy  locus in the chow group of x  in terms of the chern classes of e  and f   recent work of s diaz suggests a method of extending this formula to  morphisms of coherent sheaves that are not vector bundles given a  morphism  of coherent sheaves e and f over a nonsingular integral  quasi-projective scheme x of dimension n  2 over a field k and a  degeneracy locus as above satisfying certain conditions this thesis  derives an explicit formula for a class in the chow group of x supported  on the degeneracy locus
