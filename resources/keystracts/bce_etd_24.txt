organoceramic cadmium adsorbents thiol the adsorption dynamics of cadmium ions from aqueous streams on two organoceramic adsorbents thio-sg1 and sol-ad-iv is studied at ph  3-5 the effect of species distribution on the adsorption process is determined from an aqueous phase chemical equilibrium model calculation results indicate that free cadmium ion cd 2  and complexes cdno 3  and cdch 3 ooo  are the main species present it is postulated that the free cadmium ion is the main species participating in the adsorption process and that a bidentate complex is formed on the adsorbents experimental titration results support the presence of this complexkinetic data collected from a differential batch reactor show a slow uptake rate kinetic mechanisms including elementary reactions and a filmpore diffusion model are tested to explain experimental results the f-test is applied to determine the rate controlling step no definite conclusion is drawn from this test the fc values fall within the 95 confidence level indicating that both models are adequate and suggesting that either model can be employed to explain the experimental datathe adsorption behavior of cadmium on sol-ad-iv is predictedanalyzed in a fixed bed several mechanisms which include adsorption equilibrium overall chemical reaction film mass transfer resistances and filmpore diffusion resistances are tested to determine the fixed-bed controlling mechanism different numerical techniques are applied to solve the nonlinear pde's the method of lines is found to be the most appropriate to obtain the numerical solution fitting results of models to the breakthrough curve suggest that filmpore diffusion mechanism is the rate-controlling step sensitivity analysis on parameters confirms that the model is sensitive to pore diffusion resistance values of parameters are k f  011 cmmin d p  14  10 -7 cm 2  sec and   50 the value of dp is consistent with values reported from the literature for the cadmium-thiol system
