network monitoring routing middleware the internet is presently being used to support increasingly complex interaction models as a result of more and more applications services and frameworks becoming network centric efficient utilization of network and networked-resources is of paramount importance network performance gathering is a precursor to any scheme that seeks to provide adaptive routing capabilities for interactions furthermore hardware based performance based routing solutions are hard to manage since they require a knowledge about the underlying hardware structure of the network as well as access privileges to the network related hardware devices in this thesis we present de-centralized scalable and hardware independent performance based dynamic routing system which consists of three parts performance monitoring aggregation and dynamic routing we present a network performance aggregation framework that is extensible and appropriate for distributed messaging systems that span multiple realms disparate communication protocols and support different applications we propose using publishsubscribe messaging scheme for efficient propagation of monitored performance values in the network system we present the test results regarding the difference aspects of our system for different network settings
