parallel cascade identification intracellular signaling gesture recognition human-computer interfaces parallel cascade identification pci korenberg 1991 is an iterative algorithm that represents nonlinear systems by assembling parallel paths of cascades each of which consists of a dynamic linear element followed by a static nonlinear element this algorithm is based on a volterra series expansion of a function that represents the unknown system knowing the stimulus input and response output of a system we can use pci to help us identify and model the dynamics of various systems we have studied two biological systems intracellular signal detection in chlamydomonas reinhardtii  and gesture recognitionfor intracellular signal detection a key feature in our approach is the use of multiple inputs with different dynamical rates since experimental data are not available yet simulated results are shownfor gesture recognition parallel cascade has been modified to function as a classifier korenberg and morin 1997 we have adapted the parallel cascade to work in a real-time setting our experimental results on the gesture recognition project shows promisewe conclude with a discussion on possible applications and open problems
