aromatic amines benzenethiols formadehyde the purposes of this investigation are to determine whether aromatic amines primary and secondary will condense with benzenethiols and formaldehyde in the raio of one part thiol one part formaldehyde one part amine to form the simple n-arylaminomethyl aryl sulfides in the case of the primary amines and n-alkyl-n-arylaminomethyl aryl sulfides in the case of the secondary amines or whether n-arylaminomethylbenzenethiols are formed to determind whether the reaction with primary aromatic amines can be controlled so as to form 1 3 5-triaryl-15-dithia-3-azapentanes [bis -arylthiomethyl anilines]ar-sch2-n-ch2-s-ar'arwhen the ratio of thiol formaldehyde amine is 221
