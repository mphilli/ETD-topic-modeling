aging bcaa iron sarcopenia skeletal muscle sarcopenia which is the loss of muscle mass and strength with advancing age has been attracting the attention of many researchers in recent years which is likely the result of the demographic trend of an aging population notably good health of aging individuals includes an adequate level of muscle mass and muscle function to allow performance of activities of daily livingour group and others have conjectured that elevated skeletal muscle iron status plays a causal role in the development of sarcopenia the increase in muscle iron concentration with aging could trigger excess production of free radicals and induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction thus regulating muscle iron levels over the course of aging could be an important strategy to attenuate the onset andor progression of sarcopeniabranched-chain amino acid bcaa administration is best known for the ability to increase protein synthesis in aging skeletal muscle through activation of mtor signaling recent studies in heart tissue and cell culture suggest a possible link between mtor and iron status however there are currently no studies to examine the effect of bcaa administration on the regulation of iron status in aging skeletal muscle thus we had an interest to examine how low-iron andor bcaa containing diets regulate muscle iron status anabolic signaling oxidative stressmitochondrial dysfunction as well as muscle mass of aging animalsin this study 29 month old male f344brown norway rats were divided into two main groups control vs bcaa diet groups and further separated into subgroups by iron level in the diets regular-iron [ri] vs low-iron [li] containing diet thus animals were divided into the following groups 1 control  ri cr n11 2 control  li cl n11 3 2bcaa  ri br n10 and 4 2bcaa  li bl n12 all diets utilized the ain-93m diet either in its basic form ie cr or as a modified formulation cl br and bl low iron diets contained 2-6 ppm iron compared to regular iron-containing diets 35 ppm iron 2bcaa diets contained twice the amount of bcaa compared to the cr and cl diets bcaa ratio leucine isoleucine valine  15 1 11 animals were on the respective diets for 12 weeks following the experimental period animals were euthanized and we determined whether long-term dietary treatments with li andor 2bcaa altered the aging plantaris 1 muscle mass and muscle fiber size 2 iron status non-heme iron concentration and total non-heme iron content 3 anabolic signaling mtor and p70s6k1 4 mitochondrial biogenesis pgc-1alpha and oxidative capacity cs and cox-2 and 5 oxidative stress 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hneresults showed no difference in body mass and muscle mass between groups after 12 weeks of the dietary treatments however histological analysis revealed that animal groups fed li andor 2bcaa diets showed significantly larger plantaris muscle fiber size than that of the cr group although the effect of 2bcaa on plantaris non-heme iron concentration did not reach statistical significance p0150 animals consuming  2bcaa containing diets showed lower total non-heme iron content compared to cr and cl groups p005 moreover a significant interaction between li and 2bcaa for p70s6k1 was identified in the aging skeletal muscle p005 here animals on low iron andor 2bcaa treatments had significantly greater p70s6k1 phosphorylation level compared to the cr group p005 interestingly significant interactions were also observed between li and 2bcaa for protein levels representative of mitochondrial biogenesis pgc-1alpha and oxidative capacity cs and cox-2 p005 both pgc-1alpha p005 and cox-2 p0051 were slightly lower in the bl group than in the cl group moreover although cs appeared to be slightly greater in the cl and br groups than in the cr group p005 its level in the bl group was similar to the cr group hence combining 2bcaa with li appeared to negate a possible positive influence of li on mitochondrial capacity-related protein expression levels in aging muscle there was no difference in oxidative stress 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hne protein levels between groups p005 indicating that these long-term dietary treatments with li andor 2bcaa did not link with oxidative stress in the plantaris muscle of old ratsin conclusion although there was no effect on muscle mass the long-term dietary treatments with li andor 2bcaa showed beneficial effects on muscle fiber size this study found that while only 2bcaa administration may play a role in the regulation of iron status anabolic signaling p70s6k1 was significantly activated by li and 2bcaa diets in aging skeletal muscle however neither li nor 2bcaa containing diets exhibited significant simple effects on increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and function of aging skeletal muscle interestingly we found that co-administration of li and bcaa was likely to negate the potential impact on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in the aging skeletal muscle as compared to either diet administered individually suggesting possible interfering effects of the combined dietary interventions finally long-term dietary treatment with li andor 2bcaa appeared to have no effect on lowering markers of muscle oxidative stress collectively future studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of li and bcaa administration on muscle and mitochondrial function in aging skeletal muscle
