wetlands mercury adirondacks methylmercury dissolved organic carbon mercury hg is an environmental pollutant that leads to the contamination of forest soils lakes and streams hg is also a well known neurotoxin and human and wildlife health concerns are primarily related to exposure to methyl mercury mehg that bioaccumulates in aquatic and terrestrial organisms wetlands are important landscapes where ionic hg hg 2   is transformed to mehg and transported to downstream aquatic ecosystems this research was conducted in small forest watershed-lake ecosystems in the adirondacks to better understand hg cycling in wetlands and lakesthe study was conducted in three phases phase i and ii were designed to investigate hg transport and fate in two forest wetlands through detailed evaluations of seasonal hg concentrations and mass budgets the two wetlands a riparian peatland and an abandoned beaver meadow intercept majority of the upland runoff from archer creek draining arbutus lake watershed in phase iii hg budgets of two contrasting lakes were evaluated arbutus and sunday lakes differ in landscape physical and chemical attributesthe proportion of total mercury thg that was methyl mercury  mehg in the upland stream of archer creek increased from 2 in the upland system to 6 at the outlet of the wetlands during the growing season concentrations of thg mehg and dissolved organic carbon doc were markedly higher and sulfate so 4 2-  was markedly lower compared to the non-growing season transport of hg species was facilitated by doc production as indicated by significant positive relations with thg and mehgmass balance calculations revealed that the wetlands were net sources of thg and mehg to stream water although the magnitude of the source was a function of wetland connectivity to stream water the storage of thg and mehg in wetland soil was a large pool which seems coupled with total carbon and sulfur accumulation in the current scenario of decreasing hg emission and atmospheric deposition the large 'active' hg soil pool in wetlands is a potential short-term and long-term source of hg and mehg to downstream aquatic ecosystemsconcentrations of hg species increased with increases in doc concentrations and percent wetland coverage at arbutus 4 and sunday lake 20 negligible removal of thg inputs was observed at sunday lake that has a short hydraulic residence time hrt 002 yrs compared to approximately 60 removal at arbutus lake that has longer hrt 06 yrs
