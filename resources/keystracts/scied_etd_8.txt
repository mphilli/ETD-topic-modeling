exercise abdominal fat inflammation postmenopausal women diabetes abdominal obesity abnormal secretion of adipocytokines and chronic-low grade inflammation are proposed to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes how diet and exercise specifically affect these disorders is not clear this study investigated the effects of diet and exercise on the abdominal obesity adipocytokine and inflammatory protein levels of postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes a secondary purpose was to identify the level of diabetes scientific literacy of this population and the adequacy of their diabetes education following 14 weeks of diet d and diet  exercise d  e intervention significant reductions were observed in total abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat sat from pre to post total abdominal fat d  -7 d  e  -11 sat d  -8 d  -e  -10 and decreases in fasting blood glucose d -14 d  e -26 and total cholesterol levels d -5 d  e -9 the addition of exercise ex to diet resulted in greater reductions 13 in visceral adiposity vat suggesting that exercise is essential in the weight loss treatment reductions in total abdominal fat and sat contributed to 57 and 97 respectively of the variability in fasting glucose changes while the reductions in vat contributed to 159 of the changes in fasting insulin further we demonstrated for the first time clinically relevant reductions in two inflammatory markers interleukin 6 il-6 d -12 d  e -27 and c-reactive protein crp d -13 d  e -18 with the d and d  e intervention plasma leptin levels were significantly reduced d 20 d  e -405 and adiponectin levels were slightly elevated d 17 d  e 31 while ex had no effect on their concentration these changes were partly explained by changes in abdominal adiposity and were related to insulin sensitivity improvements lastly women were found to have adequate understanding of the type 2 diabetes physiology but to have difficulty understanding the scientific terminology of the disease further the diabetes education that the women received from the diabetes practitioners was rated as inadequate in conclusion the combination of diet and exercise appears to be the most beneficial treatment for improvements in abdominal adiposity inflammatory and adipose-derived cytokines and metabolic status of postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes
