reliability polynomials convex basis inflection point this dissertation explores a new way to look at reliability polynomials by use of a convex basis the shape of reliability polynomials has been studied by numerous people including moore shannon birnbaum esary saunders and colbourn colbourn posed the question is it true that a reliability polynomial has at most one point of inflection in the range  p   0 1 this newly created convex basis allows us to consider the inflection point problem from a new viewpoint in fact it is used to deduce that reliability polynomials can have more than one inflection point
