proteasome subunits spermatogenesis most regulated proteolysis in eukaryotic cells is carried out by a large multisubunit protease called the 26s proteasome which is composed of a 20s core particle and two 19s regulatory caps at each end in drosophila melanogaster   6 subunits of the 20s core and 5 subunits of the 19s cap have multiple isoforms encoded by separate genes the additional isoforms are invariably testis-specific in the work reported here i characterized the expression patterns of previously studied subunits pros3 pros3t and pros6t in more detail in addition i examined the expression patterns of several other proteasome subunits that had not been studied before using egfp-tagged reporter proteins the housekeeping subunits pros3 pros6 and pros5 are expressed in early stages of spermatogenesis in both nuclei and cytoplasm but gradually fade away in elongating spermatids and are not detectable in mature sperm in contrast testis-specific pros3t pros6t pros5r1 and pros5r2 are expressed after meiosis and persist in the mature sperm another interesting expression pattern is that some of these subunits localize to numerous punctate speckles trailing the actin cone complex in spermatid bundles undergoing individualizationthe functions of the pros6t subunit was studied by generating a null mutation pros6t 1  most of the spermatogenesis stages of the male-sterile pros6t 1 look normal under phase-contrast microscopy but no mature sperm are produced the individualization complexes ic becomes disorganized as they move along the tail bundles spermatid nuclei are either scattered or curled histone removal is delayed in mutant spermatid nuclei but protamine incorporation is not affected the expression analysis and the mutational study indicate that pros6t plays an essential role in drosophila individualizationin the second part of my study i identified the proteasome subunit genes in 11 drosophila species and three non- drosophila insect species by database searches the results showed that proteasome subunit gene duplication is a common phenomenon and that many additional genes are the results of retro transposition
