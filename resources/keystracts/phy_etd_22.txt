meson production beauty charm  psi5s the 5s resonance has long been thought to be a source of  b s   mesons since it is massive enough to produce  b s  b s   pairs in this work we establish the presence of b s   mesons at the 5s energy and measure its production rate using both beauty and charm decays we use all the e    e   -  collision data collected by the cleo iii detector at the 5s and at the 4s resonance energies this data consists of 0423 fb  -1  on the 5s resonance 634 fb -1  on the 4s and 232 fb -1  in the continuum below the 4s we also use 281 pb -1  data accumulated with the cleo-c detector on the  3770 resonance and another 195 pb  -1  taken in the region near 4170 mev center-of-mass energyin the first analysis we measure the asymmetry of d s meson production in 4s and 5s decays as [special characters omitted] 5 s  [arrow right] d s x [special characters omitted] 4s [arrow right] d s x   25  [special characters omitted]  we take advantage of this asymmetry which is due to the difference of b and b s meson production in the decays of the two resonances to establish b s meson production in 5s decays and measure its fraction f s  as 168[special characters omitted]  using a theoretical estimate of 9211 for the inclusive branching ratio [special characters omitted]  b s [arrow right] d s x  we also show the dependence of this measurement on the [special characters omitted] [arrow right] [straight phi]  branching fractionknowledge of the b s production rate at the 5s resonance is imperative for b s studies at the 5s using current b -factories and for future e  e - super- b factories we show in the second part of this work that the determination of f s in a model independent manner requires several tens of fb -1  we present a method that provides a measurement of f s using the relative rates of like-sign versus opposite sign dileptons the like-sign leptons result from b 0 and b s mixing in addition we show that determining the rates of single double and triple [special characters omitted] mesons provides an alternative way of finding f s to constrain our knowledge of b s production at the 5s by making other measurements with other model dependencies we examine cleo-c data for other particle species than d s  that are produced with much higher rate in b s meson decays than in b meson decays such particle like  ' and [straight phi] with their ss quark composition are expected to be enhanced in d s than in d meson decays we therefore measure the inclusive branching fractions of charm mesons namely d 0  d  and [special characters omitted]  into  x  ' x  and [straight phi] x decays we find that the rates from [special characters omitted] are much larger than from d 0 and d  we use the inclusive [straight phi] meson yields which is higher by one order of magnitude in d s than in d decays to make a second measurement of [special characters omitted] 5 s  [arrow right] [special characters omitted]  using our model estimate of [special characters omitted]  b s [arrow right] [straight phi] x  we measure [special characters omitted] 5 s  [arrow right] [straight phi] x   138  [special characters omitted]  and [special characters omitted] 4 s  [arrow right] [straight phi] x   71  01  06 the ratio of the two rates is 19  [special characters omitted]  this is the first measurement of the [straight phi] meson yield from the 5s we measure f s  246[special characters omitted]  and we also report on the total 5 s  hadronic cross section above continuum to be  e  e - 5 s   0301  0002  0039 nb this allows us to extract the fraction of b mesons as 589  100  92 equal to 1- f s  averaging the three methods gives a model dependent result of f s  [special characters omitted]
