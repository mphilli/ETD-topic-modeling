sexual behavior immune deficiency alcohol use hiv mental illness studies examining the relationship between global measures of alcohol use and sexual hiv-risk behavior have found strong associations indicating that people who drink more also tend to engage in more sexual risk behavior this study tested one explanation for such global associations alcohol use prior to sex is related to decreased condom use the participants were 159 adult psychiatric outpatients with severe and persistent mental illness spmi a population with elevated risk for hiv infection and substance use disorders the comprehensive timeline followback interview was used to assess all sexual and drug-use behavior over a 3-month period analysis of 3026 sexual behaviors reported by 123 sexually active participants indicated that at the global level participants who drank more heavily were more likely to have engaged in sexual hiv-risk behavior however alcohol use was not related to condom use during vaginal or anal intercourse vai at the event level ie participants who used condoms when sober tended to use them to the same extent when drinking in exploratory analysis a risk-index variable associated with each vai event was constructed and results indicated that women were more likely to have had high-risk sex ie unprotected vai with a new or casual partner who had at least one risk factor for hiv infection when drinking than when sober this study provides little evidence for an event-level association between alcohol use and condom use except that sex with riskier partners may be more likely when drinking explanations for findings and suggestions for future research are discussed
