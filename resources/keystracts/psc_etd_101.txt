integration political participation refugee refugee resettlement south sudanese south sudanese refugees are strongly motivated to effect change  in south sudan after resettlement to the us this motivation has resulted in  much transnational political activism on their part in australia sudanese  refugees have concentrated primarily on domestic political and social  integration why in this project i examine the possible causes of this  difference including the institutions the policies and the agents who  implement settlement programs i argue that refugee settlement policies of host  countries directly shape the political activities of their refugees when a host  country provides assistance to integrate refugees the government's policies and  the individuals who implement policy professional service providers and  volunteers influence what activities refugee leaders are likely to pursue i  find evidence that professional service providers are more likely to channel  refugees toward domestic political goals especially when they are implementing  specific refugee capacity building programs in contrast volunteers are more  likely to support refugee leaders in the political activities that the leaders  themselves are eager to pursue due to different levels of centralization and  institutionalization across these two host country contexts they have different  compositions of policy implementers and utilize capacity building programs to  differing degrees these factors play a significant role in shaping the  direction of south sudanese political activities i use evidence from  examination of institutional policies and semi-structured interviews of sudanese  refugees professional and volunteer service providers and government officials  in the usa and australia
