scalar meson nonet chiral lagrangian exotic mesons nonperturbative qcd meson-meson scattering we use effective chiral lagrangian models to consider the related problems of arriving at a quark-level understanding of the scalar mesons and of describing pseudoscalar meson-meson scattering up to energies well above threshold we study  k scattering in a [special characters omitted] -inspired nonlinear chiral lagrangian framework and get good agreement with experiment up to about 15 gev we find evidence for a new strange scalar meson the 900 this controversial state emerges in a rather subtle way in the  k channel after we carefully take account of the different contributions to the strongly interfering background below 1 gev we also make a prediction for the  channel within the same framework our work on the scalar meson puzzle involves two main ideas first we observe that the presence of the light  state results in a complete nonet of scalar mesons beneath 1 gev we explore the nonet hypothesis in the context of the role of scalar mesons in s-wave pseudoscalar meson-meson scattering we find that in particular the scalar isoscalar mixing angle suggests that such a nonet behaves like an exotic qqqq multiplet predicted some time ago by jaffe second we investigate the possible mixing of conventional and exotic states as an avenue to understanding the complete set of experimentally observed particles this leads to a simple mechanism which explains the properties of all the established isovector and isospinor states finally we look at the pseudoscalar meson scattering in the linear sigma model and compare with our previous results about scalar mesons
