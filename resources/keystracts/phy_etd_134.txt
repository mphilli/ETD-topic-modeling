lhc violation physics the large hadron collider lhc at the european organization for nuclear research cern in geneva is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator it is located in a tunnel with a circumference of 27 kilometers 17 miles whose synchrotron is designed to mainly collide opposing particle beams of protons with energy up to 7 tev in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012 lhc is designed to address some of the fundamental open questions in physics regarding the basic laws governing the interactions and forces among the elementary particles among the four major experiments at lhc a toroidal lhc apparatus atlas compact muon solenoid cms large hadron collider beauty lhcb and a large ion collider experiment alice lhcb is the one that is specialized on heavy flavor physics whose goal is to measure the charge parity violation cpv parameters and rare decays of the beauty and charm hadrons such studies can help to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe     cp violation searches are performed at lhcb in quite a few probing decay channels and systems in b_s^0-\barb_s^0 mixing the cp violation is expected to be tiny in the standard model but can be significantly enhanced in the presence of new cp violation phases in general physics models this thesis presents in chapter 5 the measurement of semileptonic asymmetry a_\textsl^\texts in \bs-\bsb mixing system at lhcb the cp-violating asymmetry a_\textsl^\texts is studied using samples of \bs and \bsb semileptonic decays in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 tev using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb-1 collected by lhcb the detected final states are \dspm\mu ^\mp with the \dspm particle reconstructed in the \phi\pipm mode the \dspm\mu ^\mp yields are summed over untagged \bsb and \bs initial states and integrated with respect to decay time data-driven methods are used to measure all the efficiency ratios needed to determine a_\textsl^\texts  we obtain a_\textsl^\texts  -006\pm050\pm036\ where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic specific attention is drawn to an elegant data-driven approach that is developed to determine the relative pion detection efficiency as described in chapter 3 it is a key building block of the a_\textsl^\texts measurement and can open many other doors to cpv\italic searches at lhcb as a ``litmus test for this tool we measure the d_s^ -- d_s^- production asymmetry using \phi\pipm mode in 7 tev pp collisions at lhc in chapter 4 heavy quark production in 7 tev center-of-mass energy of pp collisions at the lhc is not necessarily flavor symmetric the production asymmetry a_\rm p between d_s^ and d_s^- mesons is studied using the \phi\pi^\pm decay mode in a data sample of 10 fb-1 collected with the lhcb detector the difference between \pi^ and \pi^- detection efficiencies is determined using the ratios of fully reconstructed to partially reconstructed \dstarpm decays the overall production asymmetry in the d_s^\pm rapidity region 20 to 45 with transverse momentum larger than 2 gev is measured to be a_\rm p-033\pm022 \pm010\ while theoretical predictions are difficult and vague a precise measure of the production asymmetry constrains future heavy quark models and can be used as inputs for other cpv measurements
