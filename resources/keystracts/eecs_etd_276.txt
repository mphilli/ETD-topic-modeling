weighted cell-averaging cfar cell-censored cell-averaging cfar processor in radar signal detection the problem is to automatically detect a target in a nonstationary noise and clutter background while maintaining a constant probability of false-alarm classical detection using a matched filter receiver and a fixed threshold is not applicable due to the nonstationary nature of the background noise therefore adaptive threshold techniques are needed to maintain a constant false-alarm rate cfar one approach to adaptive detection in nonstationary noise and clutter background is to compare the processed target signal to an adaptive threshold in the cell-averaging cfar processing an estimate of the background noise from the leading and the lagging reference windows is used to set the adaptive threshold a threshold multiplier or scaling factor is used to scale the threshold to achieve the desired probability of false-alarmin the first part of this dissertation we have proposed two modified cell-averaging detectors for multiple target situations the first one is a weighted cell-averaging cfar detector wca-cfar where weighted leading and lagging reference windows are used to obtain the adaptive threshold the second is a cell-censored cell-averaging cfar processor where a predetermined fixed threshold is used to eliminate those cells that may contain interferencein the second part of the dissertation the theory of distributed cfar detection with data fusion is developed first a system consisting of n ca-cfar detectors with data fusion is considered the overall system is optimized so that the overall probability of detection is maximum while the overall probability of false-alarm is fixed at the desired value next cfar detection with multiple background estimators and a data fusion center is studied finally adaptive cfar detection with multiple detectors for different network topologies is considered two topologies namely a parallel and a tandem topology are investigated the overall systems are optimized so that the probability of detection is maximum while cfar is achieved
