appetite insulin insulin secretion meal frequency physical activity long uninterrupted bouts of sedentary behavior are thought to  negatively influence insulin sensitivity and may impact metabolic function  regardless of adherence to general physical activity guidelines the purpose of  this study was to determine the combined effect of physical activity 1 h  continuous exercise v intermittent exercise throughout the day and meal  consumption on glucose excursions insulin secretion and appetite markers in  obese individuals with prediabetes methods eleven healthy obese subjects  30 kgm2 with prediabetes underwent 3 12 h study days including sedentary  behavior sed exercise ex 1h morning exercise 60-65 vo2 max and physical  activity pa 12 hourly intensity-matched 5-minute bouts meals were provided  every 2 h blood samples were taken every 10 min for 12 h baseline and area  under the curve auc for serum glucose insulin c-peptide total pyy  concentrations and subjective appetite ratings as well as insulin pulsatility  were determined results no significant differences in baseline glucose  insulin or c-peptide concentrations across study days were observed p005  glucose auc 12 h and 2 h were significantly different across study days with  auc attenuated in the pa condition compared to the ex condition p005 the  12 h incremental insulin auc was reduced by pa compared to sed 17398535568  v 22735245812 pmollmin for 12 h respectively p005 similarly a  significant main effect of condition in the 2 h insulin auc was found with the  pa condition being reduced compared to sed condition p005 but no  differences between the ex and sed conditions a significant reduction in 2 h  c-peptide auc was demonstrated with ex and pa compared to the sed condition  p005 deconvolution analysis of insulin secretion revealed no significant  differences between experimental conditions there were no significant  differences in total pyy between experimental conditions though subjective  measures of hunger and satiety were reduced with continuous and intermittent  exercise conclusions short bouts of physical activity throughout the day  attenuate glucose excursions and improve insulin clearance compared to an  exercise day with 1 h of morning exercise further both continuous and  intermittent exercise mechanisms that improve satiety in obese individuals are  not related to changes in concentrations of pyy
