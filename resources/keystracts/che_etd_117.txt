sulfer dioxide sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate dihydrate during a study of intramolecular nadh coenzyme-substrate model systems oxidation of 14-dihydronicotinamides to the corresponding pyridinium ions by sulfur dioxide was observed qualitative analyses performed on the product mixture from the reaction of sulfur dioxide with 1-benzyl-14-dihydronicotinamide bnah suggested the presence of thiosulfate sulfite bisulfite andor adsorbed sulfur dioxide the initially formed reduced species of sulfur dioxide may have been hso\sb2\sp- the product of direct hydride transfer since in the presence of michael acceptors sulfones are formed esr experiments suggested the presence the known species so\sb2\sp-\bullet or so\sb2\sp-\bulletso\sb2 when the reaction of bnah with sulfur dioxide was run in methanol or dmf respectively the presence of these radicals suggests that initial single-electron transfer may occur with subsequent transfer of a hydrogen atom to give hso\sb2\sp- although the radicals might have been formed by subsequent reactions of initially formed hso\sb2\sp-the second part of this study involved a survey of the reactions of sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate dihydrate rongalite a convenient source of reduced species of sulfur dioxide presumably similar to those obtained from bnah-sulfur dioxide with organic halides reactions of mixtures of rongalite potassium bicarbonate and benzyl or alkyl bromides in dmf-water mixtures offer a convenient method for the preparation of symmetrical sulfones bis4-nitrobenzyl sulfone was the product of the reaction between 4-nitrobenzyl bromide and rongalite in the absence of bicarbonate whereas in the presence of bicarbonate the only product isolated was 44\sp\prime-dinitrobibenzyl three previously unknown sulfones were synthesized from the corresponding benzyl bromides bis4-fluorobenzyl bis2-methylbenzyl and bis3-nitrobenzyl sulfones reaction of rongalite with \alpha\alpha\sp\prime-dibromo-o-xylene at 80\sp\circc yielded a polymeric product mixture which appeared to be mainly polyo-xylylene whereas at 40\sp\circc this reaction yielded 23-benzoxathiin-3-oxide the formation of o-xylylene in these reactions was confirmed by trapping it with norbornene reaction of rongalite with phenacyl chloride gave acetophenone while the corresponding reaction with phenacyl bromide gave not only the product of reduction acetophenone but also the product of reductive coupling 14-diphenyl-14-butanedione
