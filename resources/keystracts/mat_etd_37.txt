topology boundedly controlled finiteness obstruction a cw complex x is finitely dominated if there exists a finite cw complex y together with continuous maps [special characters omitted] such that [special characters omitted]ctc wall asked the following question if x is finitely dominated does x necessarily have the homotopy type of some finite cw complex he went on to discover the answer in general is no in 1965 in [wa] a now classic paper he proved the following theoremtheorem suppose x is finitely dominated then there exists an invariant w  x   k 0  z  x  such that x has the homotopy type of a finite cw complex if and only if w  x   0here k 0  z  x  is the reduced projective class group of the integral group ring z  x  of the fundamental group of x  the invariant w  x  is called wall's finiteness obstruction for x in the 1980's douglas r anderson and hans j munkholm developed a new theory in the general area of 'topology with control' or spaces 'parametrized over a space' called boundedly controlled  bc  topology  the geometry and algebraic topology of be spaces was introduced in [am 1]in this dissertation we review the fundamentals of boundedly controlled topology and generalize wall's finiteness obstruction theorem to the category of boundedly controlled cw complexes
