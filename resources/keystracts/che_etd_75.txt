ligand organically-templated mixed-metal vanadium oxides molybdenum oxides the use of a structure directing organic ligand on mixed metal molybdenum and vanadium oxides has led to a series of new and interesting materials with varying properties by directing the formation of the mixed metal oxide sub-structure with the size shape and flexibility of the organic ligand new organicinorganic hybrid materials exhibiting an unusual structural diversity may be synthesized with a variety of new and interesting properties by utilizing chelating bidentate chelating tridentate bis-chelating tridentate tethering and tridentate ligands a variety of novel organicinorganic mixed metal molybdenum and vanadium oxide materials showing the influence of the organic ligand on the inorganic oxide sub-structure have been synthetically created and characterized hydrothermal synthesis is a simple synthetic pathway that leads to the formation of single crystal products allowing for characterization via single crystal x-ray diffraction the use of the hydrothermal medium overcomes the differential solubility problems associated with many organic and inorganic starting materials the following research endeavor contains a variety of examples of the family m ' mooligand and m ' voligand utilizing the various ligand formations stated above this poses as merely a start at the seemingly endless chemistry available in the realm of hydrothermal synthesis
