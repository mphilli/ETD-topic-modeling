ethics essence grammatical therapy emmanuel levinas ludwig wittgenstein immanuel kant this dissertation traces the entanglement of the problems of representation with the problems of ethics through the work of immanuel kant emmanuel levinas and ludwig wittgenstein the framework for this project is set by reading the ethical concerns of kant's second critique in light of the issues of representation and adjudication in the first and third critiques this work then moves to consider the development of emmanuel levinas's philosophy through his engagement with husserl heidegger and derrida as the culminating expression of these intertwined problematics finally the grammatical therapy of ludwig wittgenstein's later work is juxtaposed with this line of inquiry to provide an alternative mode of approaching ethics after ethical discourse has become suspicious of itself
