treatment acceptability teachers academic interventions behavioral interventions the purpose of the study was to investigate acceptability of both behavioral and academic interventions by teachers across different school levels whereas an abundance of research exists on treatment acceptability few studies have been conducted with middle school and high school teachers and those have failed to account for differences in teacher responses based on their school level grouping the current study included elementary middle and high school teachers as participants and examined group differences on acceptability ratings furthermore this study investigated teacher acceptability of both behavioral and academic treatments which are rarely explored concomitantly finally the current study included the use of treatments selected by teachers and shown to be effective in the treatment literature teachers 50 high school 50 middle school and 56 elementary school rated five academic and five behavioral interventions on measures of acceptability familiarity and willingness to implement each intervention while no main effect for school level was found to occur significant school level by intervention effects were obtained for the variables of academic and behavioral acceptability additionally there were significant sex by school level by intervention effects for the ratings of familiarity and implementation for both academic and behavioral interventions specifically teachers at all school levels were less accepting of the intervention of using behavioral modification techniques and high school teachers were less familiar and less willing to implement that intervention in comparison to other interventions elementary school teachers were less accepting of the intervention of administrative conferencing than middle school teachers and rated their familiarity and willingness to implement that intervention as lower than the other four behavioral interventions there was greater consistency among ratings for academic interventions as teachers as a whole tended to least prefer the intervention of direct 11 supportinstruction the results support the findings of hall and wahrman 1988 in that no main effect was found to occur for school level the study did however add to the current research base by providing information as to the type of interventions deemed acceptable by the different levels of teachers limitations implications and directions for future research are discussed
