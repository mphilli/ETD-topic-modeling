limit laws modulus trimmed sums probability theory let [special characters omitted] be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables let [special characters omitted] be an arrangement of [special characters omitted] in decreasing order of magnitude and set [special characters omitted] this is known as the modulus trimmed sum we obtain a complete characterization of the class of limit laws of the normalized modulus trimmed sum when the underlying distribution is symmetric and [special characters omitted]
