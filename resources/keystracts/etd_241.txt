cmb anomalies cosmic microwave background dark matter inflation large-scale structure slavnov taylor identities in this dissertation we study the role of correlation functions in cosmology the study is bidirectional we explore the constraints that correlation functions gathered from data impose on different theories we also analyze the constraints that get imposed on correlation functions given symmetries of theories for the former analysis we use structure formation data like the cmb and matter power spectrum to set limits on the temperature of cold dark matter particles basically only assuming that the particles were nonrelativistic when they decoupled and have interacted negligibly since in another study we use the same data to constrain how much sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter annihilation could have occurred with the analysis being insensitive to the details of the annihilation finally we propose a new method to detect the so-called cmb anomalies in a more general manner than is usually considered for the latter type of analysis we consider the role of gauge symmetry in constraining relations between n- and n1-point correlation functions for gravity coupled to a scalar field using certain assumptions we show how novel consistency relations between fields can be derived that arise only out of the symmetry of the action and are independent of its particular form
