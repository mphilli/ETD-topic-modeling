functional behavior assessment problem behavior transitions activity transitions are difficult for many children with developmental disabilities leading to problem behavior and decreased instructional time in schools assessing the function of transition-related problem behavior especially in the school setting requires special attention functional analysis methodology has been employed and can demonstrate functional relations however functional analyses may not always capture the naturally occurring contingencies or detect idiosyncratic variables thus the current study examined the concurrent validity and treatment utility of assessing transition-related problem behavior descriptively two boys with autism 8 and 11-years-old and one boy with down syndrome 6-years-old participated all sessions were conducted at an outpatient behavior analysis clinic descriptive assessments occurred during natural transitions with caregivers and results were used to design functional analysis test conditions that mimicked the components of the natural transitions based on the outcomes from the descriptive assessments and functional analyses function-matched interventions were developed and evaluated in a reversal deign for each child treatment consisted of signaling reinforcement in the post-transition activity and differentially reinforcing independent transitions in the absence of problem behavior in general outcomes from the functional analyses confirmed that the variables identified in the descriptive assessment were functionally related to each childs problem behavior additionally function-matched interventions were effective at reducing problem behavior for all children the benefits of assessing transition-related problem behavior both descriptively and experimentally are discussedkeywords transitions problem behavior functional behavior assessment
