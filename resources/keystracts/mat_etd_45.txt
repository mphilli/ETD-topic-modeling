indifference zone subset selection statistics mathematics we refer to the two classical approaches to ranking and selection problems as the indifference zone approach and the subset selection approach in this thesis we integrate these two approaches in selecting 1 the population with the largest mean the best population among k normal populations with unknown variances 2 the population associated with the largest population proportion the best population among k binomial populations assuming a common large sample size in this integrated approach the parameter space is divided into two disjoint subsets namely the preference zone pz and the indifference zone iz the concept of correct selection is defined differently in each of these zones in the pz we are required to select the best population for a correct selection cs\sb1 in the iz we define any selected subset to be correct cs\sb2 if it contains the best population a stein-type stein 1945 two-stage selection procedure is proposed for the normal case with common and unknown variance for the normal case with uncommon and unknown variances a dudewicz-dalal-type two-stage selection procedure is proposed a selection rule is also proposed for the large sample binomial case lower bounds and formulas for the probability of correct selection under pz and the probability of correct selection under iz are developed it is shown that the least favorable configuration lfc in pz is the slippage configuration and the worst configuration wc in iz is the equal parameter configuration for the unknown and equal variance normal case for the unknown and unequal variances normal case it is proven that the slippage configuration is the least favorable configuration lfc in pz and simulation study is conducted to investigate the worst configuration in iz for the binomial case it is shown that the equal parameter configuration is the worst configuration in iz for the case of k  2 and the least favorable configuration lfc in pz is the slippage configuration a set of sufficient condition is also given for the monotonicity of the probability of correct selection in the indifference zone for the binomial case it is proven that all proposed procedures guarantee that the following probability requirements are met 1 the probability of selecting the best population in the pz is at least p\sbsp1 and 2 the probability of selecting a subset which would contain the best population is at least p\sbsp2 when the true parameters are in the iz the expected subset sizes for all procedures are studied bounds for the expected sample sizes are developed for the normal cases tables necessary to implement these procedures are provided numerical examples are given simulation studies are also conducted
