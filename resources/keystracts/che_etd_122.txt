raman optical activity following steady development over the past two decades the theory and measurement of raman optical activity roa have both reached a sophisticated level this dissertation presents advances in roa in the areas of artifact control experimental measurements theoretical intensity computation isolation of pre-resonance behavior and observation of surfaced-enhanced phenomenabackscattering incident circular polarization icp and in-phase dual circular polarization dcp\sb\rm i roa have been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally to be the best configurations for routine roa studies on biological molecules in the far-from-resonance limit since dcp\sb\rm i roa provides better signal-to-noise ratios and artifact control when both methods are available on the same roa instrument backscattering dcp\sb\rm i roa spectra were recorded for terpene molecules --trans-pinane --cis-myrtanylamine -- -pinene -- -pinene -nopinone --verbenone --myrtenol --nopol --myrtenal --fenchone -limonene and --carvone as neat liquids and --camphor and --camphene in ccl\sb4 ephedrine molecules 1s2r-ephedrine 1s2r-norephedrine 1s2s-pseudoephedrine and 1s2s-norpseudoephedrine in hcl aqueous solution an amino acid l-alanine in h\sb2o and d\sb2o solution four peptides glycyl-l-alanine l-alanylglycine l-alanyl-l-alanine and l-alanyl-l-alanyl-l-alanine in h\sb2o and d\sb2o solution and two proteins lysozyme and albumintheoretical raman and roa intensities for l-alanine l-alanine-2-d\sb1 and l-alanine-333-d\sb3 in h\sb2o and d\sb2o solution were calculated by using ab initio methods with a 6-31g basis set a self-consistent-field calculation with the inclusion of an onsager reaction field to simulate solvent effects was found necessary to stabilize properly the zwitterionic form of alanine a high level of agreement was found between experiment and calculation for both raman and roa spectraby comparing backscattering icp and dcp\sb\rm i roa and right-angle icp and scattered circular polarization scp roa spectra pre-resonance roa behavior was observed the gradual breakdown of the far-from-resonance approximation was observed by comparing roa spectra for --trans-pinane -- -pinene --verbenone and -quinidine the differences between backscattering icp and dcp\sb\rm i roa spectra also resulted in an indirect observation of out-of-phase dual circular polarization dcp\sb\rm ii roa signalpossible observation of surface-enhanced roa phenomena for quinidine in an agcl colloid is reported here for the first time the experiment was carried out by using a backscattering dcp\sb\rm i roa configuration this may open a new frontier for roa studies
