dried films calcium binding chromophores optical memory bacteriorhodopsin part i a protocol for the routine isolation and purification of purple membrane sheets containing the integral membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin was developed based upon modifications of protocols already in the literature this simplified protocol is geared toward the facile isolation of protein for use in molecular electronic devices methods for the incorporation of bacteriorhodopsin into various polymeric supports were also developed primarily in the form of dried films and hydrated cubes this work also represents the first reported production of dried films of the deionized protein or blue membranepart ii an architecture for a volumetric optical memory based on the branched-photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin is presented the branching reaction circumvents problems associated with destructive reading and writing processes and allows access to a stable long-lived state separated both temporally and energetically from the main photocycle thereby making long-term data storage possible the state denoted as q can only be accessed by exposing the protein to two different wavelengths of light in the proper sequence with the appropriate temporal separation roughly 2 ms between the light pulses the q-state assigned as a binary one is transparent to both writing and reading processes making them rigorously non-destructive bacteriorhodopsin in its resting state is assigned as a binary zero a differential absorption reading process is used to determine the state of each volumetric binary element preliminary results are reportedpart iii the nature of the chromophore binding site of light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin is analyzed by using all-valence electron mndo and mndo-psdci molecular orbital theory to interpret previously reported linear and nonlinear optical spectroscopic measurements it is concluded that the unique two-photon properties of the chromophore are due in part to the electrostatic field associated with a ca\sp2 ion near the chromophore four amino acids and three water molecules contribute significantly to the assigned chromophore adjacent calcium binding site and two conformational minima are predicted the cation binding site described is identified as the second high affinity binding site for calcium and the chromophore binding site is to a first approximation positively charged
