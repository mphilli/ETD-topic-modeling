critical race theory critical whiteness theory culturally based pedagogy literacy across the curriculum racialized practices teacher education the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the racialized practices enacted by seven preservice teachers while they participated in a university-based literacy across the curriculum course that included a school-based tutoring component  research questions asked 1 what racialized practices were enacted by preservice content-area teachers when they participated in a required literacy across the curriculum course that included one-on-one tutoring of youth at an urban secondary school and 2 how did preservice content-area teachers' backgrounds contribute to their racialized practicesthis study drew on the premises of critical race theory and critical whiteness theory to define racialized practices  the study began with these theories' assumptions that race is an important social construction in us society that is used to position people hierarchically especially oppressing people of color  racialized practices are ways of acting speaking and teaching that construct race as important  these practices include colorblindness essentializing and microaggression as well as culturally responsive teaching a positive racialized practice grounded in students' funds of knowledge and intended to counter more oppressive practicesdata sources included transcripts from semi-structured interviews field notes from classroom and tutoring observations and various course and tutoring related artifacts such as the course syllabus lesson plans unit plans and written reflections  data were analyzed first using a reflexive constant comparative approach to gain insights into participants' rhetoric and actions  second data were reconsidered to delineate racialized practicesthe racialized practices of the preservice teachers involved in this literacy study were categorized as relationship-focused or instructionally-focused  although all participants enacted both positive and negative racialized practices relationship-focused participants tended to exhibit qualitatively different practices compared to the instructionally-focused participants  regardless of their orientation when participants shared their view of whether race mattered in education the mostly white participants spoke predominantly of the significance of other people's races and not their own raceracialized practices that were consistent with culturally-based pedagogies included intentionally nurturing relationships with students at the tutoring site talking about ways to help students understand and negotiate the culture of power that is dominant in educational institutions including higher education and cautioning preservice peers that they need to be cognizant not to advance stereotypes  racialized practices that reflected participants' deficit thinking about their tutees as well as their own discomfort in talking about racial issues included the enactments of racial microaggressions distancing strategies and white talkthis study provides new insights into how preservice teachers' racialized practices shape and are shaped by the racial hierarchy that continues to exist in schools  findings have implications for school professionals teacher educators and researchers who are interested in identifying and disrupting racialized literacy practices that may be harmful to students  additionally this study suggests that further exploration is needed to understand how race is implicated in relationship-focused literacy teaching content-focused literacy teaching and students' engagement in learning across the curriculumâ€ƒ
