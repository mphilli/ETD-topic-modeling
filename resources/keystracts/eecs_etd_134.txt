distributed detection multisensor fusion signal detection decision trees in a distributed detection network a cluster of sensors observe a common unknown hypothesis make preliminary decisions and then transmit them to a fusion center based on received sensor decisions the fusion center makes the final decision with regard to the unknown hypothesis in this dissertation we develop some computationally efficient algorithms for the design of distributed detection networksfirst we consider the problem of distributed binary detection with n iid sensor observations our goal is to obtain the optimum sensor threshold  and the optimum k -out-of- n fusion rule for the bayesian problem we prove that for a fixed k  the probability of error is a quasiconvex function of  we then develop an algorithm to efficiently compute the optimum  we further generalize the k -out-of- n fusion rule to allow simultaneous optimization of k and  for the neyman-pearson detection problem we show the property of quasiconvexity in a similar mannersecond we consider designing multibit quantizers for distributed binary detection we develop a sensor quantizer that minimizes the mean-squared-error while quantizing the log likelihood ratio for this quantizer we develop a lloyd type of algorithm to compute the quantizer parameters our quantizer is then applied to signal detection in additive generalized gaussian noise and to diversity signal reception over rayleigh fading channelsthird we consider the problem of distributed m-ary detection to obtain a low complexity solution we break the m-ary decision-making process into a sequence of binary decision-making processes the latter are organized in the form of a binary decision tree bdt we develop an information distance based method for the construction of the bdt we also obtain the optimal decision rules for the internal nodes of the bdtfinally we consider the design of extended neyman-pearson tests in which one hypothesis is tested against a set of hypotheses the structure of extended neyman-pearson tests involves the weighted sum of likelihood ratios and a threshold we develop an algorithm that intelligently searches through the weight space until it finds the optimum weights compared to the exhaustive search method our algorithm greatly reduces the number of search cycles
