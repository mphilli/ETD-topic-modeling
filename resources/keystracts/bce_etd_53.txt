chemical engineering heat transfer transport equations thermodynamic coupling this study investigates a multi component dimension to the mass transfer of heat and a number of effects to be considered in detail are discussed including property variation with concentration thermodynamic coupling and the effects of body forces acting on non-uniform density distributions caused by both temperature and concentration fields the present study was initiated to investigate these effects for a number of binary gaseous systems with air being the ambient gas in each case
