sol-gel organoceramic metal ion separations aqueous streams novel organo-ceramic composite materials prepared in our laboratory by sol-gel processing are proposed as adsorbents for metal separations in wastewater treatment processes and hydrometallurgical processes normally organo-ceramic adsorbents are developed either by solvent deposition or by covalent ligand attachment techniques these conventional ceramic-supported adsorbents have good mechanical chemical and thermal strengths and well-defined pore characteristics but their applications are limited due to their low metal uptake capacities this limitation is overcome in this study by the direct incorporation of the functionality into the composite matrix through the reaction of two silane compounds as the precursors of the ceramic skeleton and functionality carrierthree organo-ceramic composite materials functionalized with thiol sol-ad imidazole sol-ips and pyrazole sol-pzps moieties are synthesized and characterized for their applications various synthesis parameters are considered and controlled to produce these adsorbents at optimal conditions sol-ad adsorbents are developed for the extraction of cadmium and mercury ions from wastewater streams sol-ad-iv specifically has maximum uptake capacities of 220 mggm of cadmium and 1280 mggm of mercury this adsorbent is being further studied for removal of mercury from scrubber solutions generated from coal-fired power plants sol-ips and sol-pzps adsorbents are developed to selectively extract palladiumii platinumiv and goldiii chlorides from other transition metal ions in hydrochloric acid solutions sol-ips-f-22 synthesized at the optimal conditions has 154 141 and 243 mmolgm of maximum uptake capacities at 01 m hcl concentration for pdii ptiv and auiii chlorides respectively sol-pzps-bd-5 synthesized at the optimal conditions has 141 055 and 176 mmolgm of uptake capacities at 20 m hcl solutions for pdii ptiv and auiii chlorides respectively sol-ips-f-22 and sol-pzps-bd-5 have no reactivity for copper and iron ions which primarily exist in noble metal leaching solutions in addition sol-pzps-bd-5 has strong selectivity for pdii chloride over ptiv and auiii chlorides hence palladium can selectively be extracted from the mixture solutions of these metal ions by a column operationin addition to such desirable properties these adsorbents maintain high physico-chemical stability during repeated uses hence the potential of sol-gel processing for the synthesis of high performance organo-ceramic adsorbents is demonstrated in this study
