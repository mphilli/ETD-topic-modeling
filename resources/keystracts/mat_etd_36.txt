testing designs ranking two-stage design population selection we propose three separate procedures for selecting one among several normal populations provided it is better than a specified standard the three procedures stem from three different variance assumptions the first procedure assumes the populations share a common known variance the second assumes the populations share a common unknown variance and the third assumes the population variances are unequal and unknown each procedure is a modification of the two-stage selection and testing procedures of thall simon and ellenberg 1988 1989 which were formulated to compare several binomial populations to a control population in the first stage ranking and selection techniques are used to screen out the one most promising population in the second stage hypothesis testing techniques are used to compare the chosen population to the standard an option for terminating the procedure at stage one is offered if none of the populations seem better than the standardin each of our procedures we assume that we have k 2 normally distributed populations  1   2   k  having unknown means  1   2   k  respectively we also assume that we have a fixed known constant standard  0 to which the  i are to be compared the goal is to select one of the k populations provided that it is better than the standard if none of the k populations is better than the standard then no population is to be chosen we assume that a large population mean is desirable and hence 'better than the standard' means that the population mean is sufficiently larger than the standardtables of parameter values necessary to implement the procedures are provided with a guarantee of appropriately defined size and power requirements sample size comparisons are performed between our procedures and the analogous procedures of bechhofer and turnbull 1978 for the case of common known and common unknown variance and taneja and dudewicz 1992 for the case of unequal unknown variances it is shown that total sample size requirements for our procedures are smaller than the corresponding procedures of bechhofer and turnbull the sample size comparison with taneja and dudewicz's procedure indicates that our procedure is more efficient for small initial sample sizes and when none of the populations are better than the standard
