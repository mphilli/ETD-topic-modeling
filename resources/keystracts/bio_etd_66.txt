hybridization seed characteristics fecundity seed yield the present study is intended to cast some light on the problem of t glauca but in so doing a slightly different experimental approach has been developed and applied in the first part intra-and interspecific hybridization of the three species t latifolia t angustifolia and t glauca produced significant alterations in certain seed characteristics there were color dimensions of the external cellular layer endosperm width embryo width and embryo length  in the second part the relative fecundity of the species as measured by seed yield together with external seed dimensions seed weight and the above seed characteristics were related to the issue of the origin of t glauca
