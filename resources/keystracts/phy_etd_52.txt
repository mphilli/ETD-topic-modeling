strange quark proton parity-violating weak neutral current we have measured the parity-violating electroweak asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from the proton the kinematic point [[left angle bracket][straight theta] lab [right angle bracket]  048 gev  c  2 ] is chosen to provide sensitivity at a level that is of theoretical interest to the strange electric form factor [special characters omitted] the result a  -145  22 ppm is consistent with the electroweak standard model and no additional contributions from strange quarks in particular the measurement implies [special characters omitted]  039[special characters omitted]  0023  0034stat  0026[special characters omitted]  where the last uncertainty arises from the estimated uncertainty in the neutron electric form factor
