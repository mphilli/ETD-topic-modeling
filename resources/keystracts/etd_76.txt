 flame-assisted fuel cells ffcs based on solid oxide fuel cells sofcs have received more attention in recent years due to their simple configuration and capability of utilizing hydrocarbons directly to produce electricity  however the power outputs of ffcs are relatively low compared to that of dual chamber sofcs dc-sofcs and single chamber sofcs sc-sofcs  further the carbon coking and thermal shock issues still prohibit wide applications of ffcs  moreover operating conditions of ffcs such as relative positions between flames and fuel cells and fuel flow rates are important factors that affect the ffcs power output and such data are currently lacking  the main purposes of this dissertation study are 1 develop a composite cathode and a catalyst layer in order to improve the power output and the coking resistance of ffcs 2 investigate the effects of operating conditions on ffcs performance and 3 develop ffcs with high power outputs and high thermal shock resistance by adapting fuel cells with different configurationsto improve the ffcs performance a composite cathode ba05sr05co08fe02o3 bscf  sm02ce08o2- sdc was first investigated and optimized  experimental results showed that the electrochemical performance of a bscfsdc composite cathode was greatly influenced by sintering temperatures and the best sintering temperature for the bscfsdc composite cathode was determined  later a mesoporous sdcru catalyst was developed and examined  the highly porous structure of the sdcru catalyst ensured fast diffusion of gas inside of the catalyst layer and exhibited a relatively high power output and effective carbon coking resistance  experimental results also showed that the performance of the electrolyte supported sofc es-sofc based ffcs strongly depended on the location of the fuel cell with respect to the ffcs temperature  the es-sofc based ffcs also presented a low thermal shock resistance due to its thick electrolyteto address the thermal shock issue of the es-sofcs based ffcs and to further improve the ffcs performance we have developed two different ffcs configurations based on anode-supported sofcs as-sofcs sdc based ffcs and ysz yttria stabilized zirconia-sdc based ffcs  the sdc based ffcs exhibited much better performance and thermal shock resistance when compared to that of es-sofcs  a power density of  791 mwcm-2 and a maximum current density of  2300 macm-2 were achieved which are comparable to the performances of the dc-sofcs and sc-sofcs  the total flow rates and fuel flow rates were found to have a great effect on the ffcs temperatures and fuel concentration thus further impacting the ffcs performance  the ysz-sdc based ffcs were then fabricated and investigated  the sintering temperatures of the ffc electrolyte were found to determine the ffc performance and 1350 oc is the favorable sintering temperature to achieve the dense electrolyte and the best power output  experimental results also showed that the ysz-sdc based ffcs exhibited the higher ocvs but lower power densities compared to that of sdc based sofcs  however the performance of ysz-sdc based ffcs dropped much slower for higher equivalent ratios compare to that of sdc based sofcs which could effectively expand the ffcs operating windows
