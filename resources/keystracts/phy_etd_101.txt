physics nuclear in the first part of this thesis a prescription is given for obtaining the representations of certain non-compact groups  of the kind that have been found useful in the analysis of classical systems well known techniques have been used in a systematic fashion and is necessarily mathematical however we apply this technique in the second part to study properties of strongly interacting particles results that one obtains is compared against experiment
