korean politics korean presidency presidentialism state-society relations this study attempts to explain why all of south korean presidents without exception and notwithstanding their individual major contributions to the process of koreas development have fallen victim to disgraceful downfallsfor the analysis i employ sn sangmpams middle-range theory that establishes a causal link between society-rooted politics and political outcomes building on his analytical frameworks that non-western countries are characterized by over-politicization in politics as a function of social context i argue that patterned downfalls of all korean presidents are an institutional outcome of over-politicization in korean politics which is itself a function of not fully entrenched capitalist society  in support of my thesis i test three hypotheses hypotheses one and two posit koreas tenacious traditional and cultural traits as an internal modifier of capitalism and the nations dependent nature of its relationships with the united states and japan as an external factor that prevented capitalist entrenchment in korean society  the combined effect of these two variables is the alteration of capitalism in south korea that defies the three cardinal rules of democracy leading to over-politicized behaviors in presidential politicsas for the patterned downfalls of the presidents i test the hypothesis empirically that as the nations most supreme political institution the korean presidency displayed the effects of over-politicization most saliently the evidence reveals that both authoritarian 1948-1987 and democratic 1988-2009 presidents display diverse manifestations of over-politicized behaviors however there is also a striking difference between the two eras authoritarian presidents seem more influenced by the external causal variable mainly because of koreas heavy dependence on the united states and japan in the formative years of the nation building democratic presidents are more challenged by internal causal variable especially the characteristics of what i call familist collectivism the dominant operating principle and code of conduct for most koreans in the period of 1948-2009  thus unless the social causal variable is properly addressed the problem may remain regardless of regime types
