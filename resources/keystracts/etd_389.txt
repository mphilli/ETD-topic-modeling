 a measurement of the shape of the isgur-wise function for the decay lb-lcmunu is presented it is performed with a sample of lb semileptonic decays in proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 3 fb-1 the semileptonic decays lb-lcmunux are identied bythe detection of a muon and a lc baryon decaying to pkpi the decay lb-lcpipimunu is used to isolate the semileptonic decay lb-lcmunu and determine the spectrum dndwlb-lcmunu where w is the inner product of the 4-velocities of the the initial and nal state heavy baryons the slope and curvature of the isgur-wise function have been determined with a variety of shape assumptions the measured values are consistent with sum rules bounds finally the shape of the spectrum dndq2 has been studied and compared with recent lattice qcd predictions
