privacy-preserving data publishing randomization randomization has emerged as an important approach for data disguising in privacy-preserving data publishing  ppdp due to different data it is applied to the randomization approach falls into into two classes random perturbation  rp for continuous data and randomized response  rr for categorical data in ppdp utility is an important metric and referred to the preservation of data mining information while as a more important metric privacy is referred to the preservation of the original information privacy can be determined by different aspects such as attribute correlations randomization parameters etc however in the aspect of the attribute correlations no one has studied whether it is a factor affecting privacy and how it affects the privacy preserving property of the randomization in the aspect of the randomization parameters no one has investigated how to systematically compare different randomization parameters and what the optimal randomization parameters are so that the disguised data are most privacy-preserved but still useful for data mining computationsthis thesis addresses these problems first  we identify that a key factor to affect privacy is the correlations among attributes we propose two data reconstruction methods that are based on continuous attribute correlations we have analyzed the relationship between data correlations and the amount of private information that can be disclosed based on our proposed data reconstructions schemes our studies have shown that when the correlations are high the original data can be reconstructed more accurately ie more private information can be disclosed to improve privacy we propose a modified randomization scheme based on the identified factor the attribute correlations our experimental results have shown that as the improved randomization method is used the reconstruction accuracy of both reconstruction methods becomes worse or less private information is disclosed second  for rr we formulate the quantifications of privacy and utility as estimate problems by using the quantifications to compare different rr schemes we employ an evolutionary multi-objective optimization method to find optimal randomization parameters of rr the experimental results have shown that our scheme has a much better performance than the existing rr schemes third  for rp we first formulate an rp technique which is more general than the existing rp technique after generaling rp technique we discretize the data range and use a matrix to hold the randomization parameters we also formulate the quantifications of privacy and utility for the generalized rp technique as estimate problems because to measure utility is expensive we propose an efficient approach to approximate it according to the privacy and approximate utility metrics we utilize an evolutionary multi-objective optimization method to find optimal randomization parameters of rp we show that our scheme to choose the parameters has outperformed the existing scheme
