tympanic membrane hearing depolarization threshold action potential anatomy  physiology neurology the recovery from prior stimulation of the compound action potential cap was measured in normal hearing subjects by recording the cap from the tympanic membrane using a forward masking stimulus paradigm the effects of a 4000 hz 97 db spl conditioning stimulus on cap amplitude and latency in response to a 4000 hz probe were measured as a function of conditioner-probe interval for three probe levels normalized probe response amplitude was completely recovered to the control values at an average conditioner-probe interval of 1142 ms n1 latency was completely recovered to its control value at an average conditioner-probe interval of 164 ms the time for complete recovery from prior stimulation of human cap amplitude was similar to that observed in chinchilla for similar stimulus conditions relkin doucet and sterns 1994 the present results are interpreted as a consequence of the slow recovery of low spontaneous-rate sr high threshold neurons from prior stimulation relkin and doucet 1991 and may provide the first indirect physiological evidence for the existence of a class of low-sr auditory neurons in humans
