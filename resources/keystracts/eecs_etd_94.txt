uhf subsampling receiver cmos silicon-on-insulator design and implementation of a subsampling receiver front-end built on silicon on insulator soi complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos technology is presented to the best of our knowledge our work is the first of its kind reported to date the subsampling receiver is suitable for future mars missions and would become commercial when technology ripenshigh-gain low noise amplifier lna and track and hold circuit th are the major two building blocks in the subsampling receiver drawing 13mw from 25v power supply the high-gain lna provides 83db gain and 26db noise figure nf at 435mhz it is shown that although the transistor 3-db bandwidth is below the operating frequency a high-gain low noise low power amplifier can be implemented with current technologya novel th design shows that by simplifying the circuit architecture with respect to the operational transconductance amplifier ota and the th routing it is possible to achieve high-speed low power track and hold circuits the th is able to handle frequency shift key fsk and double differential phase shift key ddpsk up to 2mhz bandwidth and data signal rate dsr of 100kbps transgate switches are used in the design to alleviate charge injection and clock feedthrough the th draws 15mw from 25v power supplythe subsampling receiver outperforms the state-of-the-art soa superheterodyne receivers regarding to speed and power consumption which are the major concerns in the space and next generation communication systems
