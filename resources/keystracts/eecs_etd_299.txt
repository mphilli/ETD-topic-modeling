intelligent algorithm positioning signal processing wireless communication there are a lot of optimization needs in the research and design of wireless communica- tion systems many of these optimization problems are nondeterministic polynomial np hard problems and could not be solved well many of other non-np-hard optimization problems are combinatorial and do not have satisfying solutions either this dissertation presents a series of particle swarm optimization pso based search and optimization algorithms that solve open research and design problems in wireless communications these problems are either avoided or solved approximately beforepso is a bottom-up approach for optimization problems it imposes no conditions on the underlying problem its simple formulation makes it easy to implement apply extend and hybridize the algorithm uses simple operators like adders and multipliers to travel through the search space and the process requires just five simple steps pso is also easy to control because it has limited number of parameters and is less sensitive to parameters than other swarm intelligence algorithms it is not dependent on initial points and converges very fastfour types of pso based approaches are proposed targeting four different kinds of problems in wireless communications first we use binary pso and continuous pso together to find optimal compositions of gaussian derivative pulses to form several uwb pulses that not only comply with the fcc spectrum mask but also best exploit the avail- able spectrum and power second three different pso based algorithms are developed to solve the nloslos channel differentiation nlos range error mitigation and multilateration problems respectively third a pso based search method is proposed to find optimal orthogonal code sets to reduce the inter carrier interference effects in an frequency redundant ofdm system fourth a pso based phase optimization technique is proposed in reducing the papr of an frequency redundant ofdm system the pso based approaches are compared with other canonical solutions for these communication problems and showed superior performance in many aspects which are confirmed by analysis and simulation results provided respectively open questions and futureopen questions and future works for the dissertation are proposed to serve as a guide for the future research efforts
