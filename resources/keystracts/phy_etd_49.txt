photochromic electrochromic optical switching tungsten oxide optical memory in order to develop optical switches for optical computing we searched for a candidate optically nonlinear material system that could be optimized for use in the fabrication of a nonlinear interface optical switch nios we chose thin films of tungsten oxide clusters while experimentally verifying the optical nonlinearity of tungsten oxide cluster films we discovered a latching color transition of wo 3 powder from yellow to blue using two wavelengths of light one blue-green and one infrared we then experimentally verified the yellow to blue color transition and determined how to recover the yellow state from the blue state using a single infrared wavelength we used this knowledge to develop a photochromic optical memory system we explored the optical power dependence of the photochromic process these studies led us to believe that the writing process involves electronic transitions due to the blue-green wavelength and thermal softening of the lattice due to the infrared wavelength this leads to reduction of the yellow media during the subsequent cooling into a substoichiometric blue state this change of state is a latching process as the blue state remains until it is erased the erase process involves heating of the medium in contact with o 2 or some other oxidant to return it to the thermodynamic ground state of the tungsten-oxygen system yellow wo 3  the nios concept was then combined with the results of our new understanding of the photochromism of tungsten oxide to produce latching optical switches
