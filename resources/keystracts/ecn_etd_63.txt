economics family neighborhood quality homeowners labor supply divorce my dissertation considers within a dynamic framework how actual or predicted changes in individuals' family circumstances influence their behavior and economic well-being first i examine the impact that changes in neighborhood quality have on the probability of moving after 1970 for younger and older homeowners in the united states i use multiperiod data from the panel study of income dynamics psid linked to neighborhood level variables from census data and find that a decrease in neighborhood quality increases the probability of moving for younger homeowners but has no significant impact on the probability of moving for older homeownerssecond i compare and contrast the short-term and long-term economic consequences of marital separation on men and women in the united states and germany for these analyses i use both the psid and the german socio-economic panel gsoep the findings suggest that women in both the united states and germany sustain large declines in their household-size adjusted income after divorce while men in these countries experience only small declines or even increases in their household-size adjusted income however group averages mask the great diversity in economic well-being changes after divorce the short- and long-term economic consequences of divorce vary by education employment number of children income level remarriage and cohabitation for both men and womenthird i consider the extent to which married women in the united states and germany anticipate divorce and increase their labor supply in response i use longitudinal data from the psid and the gsoep and find as do other researchers that the probability of divorce had a significant and positive impact on labor supply decisions for us married women in the 1970s however i find this is no longer the case for us married women in the 1980s i do find that the probability of divorce positively and significantly influences labor force participation decisions for german married women in the 1980s however the results suggest that it does not influence hours decisions
