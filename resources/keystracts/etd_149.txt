arginine g protein coupled receptors we have newly synthesized a number of compounds that permit modeling of interactions between tyrosine and arginine side chains these include alkylguanidine free bases both alone and complexed andor covalently bonded to phenol groups examples of the newly-synthesized compounds include p-phenol-dodecyl-guanidine free base p-phenol-ethyl-guanidine free base and the 11 mixture of p-cresol and dodecyl guanidine free base the synthesis of such molecules which lack other h-bonding groups besides the phenol and guanidine facilitates isolation of their interaction uv and ir spectra indicate that neutral phenol and guanidine free base form an unusually strong h-bonding pair in both crystalline state and in non-polar solvents such as dmso and hexane using uv spectra and the van 't hoff equation an experimental value of h  -74  4 kj mol-1 was obtained for formation of the p-cresoldodecylguanidine complex in hexane this was confirmed by computational modeling in vacuo using density functional theory the unusual strength of the guanidine-phenol h-bond is also supported by the presence of large continuum absorbance band in ir spectra of the aforementioned compounds by their high melting points  and by the short h-bond length between the phenolic oxygen and one or two of the guanidine nitrogens as measured in x-ray crystal structures and in computational models all these properties associated with strong h-bonding are much weaker or absent when these compounds are protonated by an external acid eg hbr to form phenol  guanidinium dyads the guanidine-phenol h-bond is strong and highly polarizable due to the similar pka values of proton donor and acceptor the position of the proton within the h-bond therefore shifts easily in different environments for example ir uv and 1h nmr spectra showed evidence of increasing proton transfer from phenol to guanidine as the solvent polarity increases from hexane to dimethylsulfoxide furthermore in crystals where methanol co-crystallizes around the h-bonded grouping ir 15n solid-state nmr and x-ray crystallographic measurements showed clearly that there is a near complete proton transfer from phenol to guanidine we use these results to model h-bonded uncharged arginine-tyrosine dyads which we term bury motifs and hypothesize that such motifs play a role in activated states of 7-tm proteins including both gpcrs and microbial rhodopsins
