electrical engineering computer science this document describes the application of formal methods to concurrent software systems specifically communication protocols the chosen formal method is milner's process algebra called the calculus of communicating systems ccs we applied ccs to the specification and verification of the open systems interconnection osi session layer sl we modeled the session layer service and session layer protocol in ccs and verified it using ccs's automated model checker the edinburgh concurrency workbench cwb we verified that the protocol specification satisfies the service specification we also formally embedded ccs in the first-order formal language larch using the automated theorem prover penelope we tested the embedding by specifying and verifying a simple two-slot buffer example we compared the automated tools by specifying a portion of the session layer and verifying it using penelope
