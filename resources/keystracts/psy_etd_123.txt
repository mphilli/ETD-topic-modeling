developmental psychology psychology experiments the present study examined perceptual asymmetries in a sample of medical technologists and a control group as a function of domain-specific knowledge skill and visual field differences were investigated in a bacteria recognition task skilled individuals were significantly faster and more accurate than controls under each probe conditions ie positive easy negative difficult negative these results indicate that knowledge representations facilitated recognition ability in the skilled groupmedical technologists exhibited a significantly lower error rate than controls under rvflh presentations during positive probes no skill differences were observed during lvfrh presentations this finding is consistent with goldberg and costa's 1981 model of hemispheric specialization suggesting that descriptive systems ie cognitive strategies are utilized by the left hemisphere during skilled performance expected skill by visual field differences for difficult negative probes were not observedthe present study also examined perceptual asymmetries under interstimulus intervals isi of 50 ms and 1000 ms controls were slower under the 1000 ms isi condition relative to medical technologists expected visual field differences under the 1000 ms isi condition were not observed this result suggests that hemispheric asymmetries related to skill may emerge during early sensory analysis as well as later stages of information processing several block by visual field interactions were also observed that are consistent with a rvflh shift in asymmetry over trials during letter recognition eg see hellige 1976 and face recognition tasks eg see ross  turkewitz 1982visual recognition performance was relatively unaffected by age in the skilled group the present findings support a model of adult cognition that acknowledges the important influence of domain-specific knowledge on perceptual and cognitive skills with age eg see clancy  hoyer 1989 rybash hoyer  roodin 1986the results of the present study suggest that some components of skilled performance may be related to hemispheric specialization a goal of future research is to examine how the two hemispheres act in unison during skilled visual performance it is suggested that systematic research based on computational model of hemispheric processing is needed to examine hemispheric differences in skilled processing under varied stimulus input eg degradation and task conditions eg classification detection visual search
