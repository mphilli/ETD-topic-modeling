human rights lgbt politics neoliberalism race sassoi sexual citizenship welcome akwaaba ghana warmly welcomes all visitors of goodwill ghana does not welcome paedophiles and other sexual deviants indeed ghana imposes extremely harsh penalties on such sexually aberrant behaviour if you are in ghana for such activity then for everybodys good including your own we suggest you go elsewhere this sign greets arrivals at ghanas kotoka international airport the main port of entry by flight into the country drawing their attention to the proscriptive and prescriptive values around sexuality and sexual practices in red font sexual deviance is left ambiguous leaving the reader to interpret signify the signamphibious subjects is an ethnographic investigation of the lives of self-identified effeminate men in urban postcolonial ghana collectively known in local parlance as sassoi a study exploring the hidden transcripts beyond signs like the one at the airport it also critically engages assumptions about ghana as simultaneously heterosexual and homophobic oppositional views parroted by the nation-state and international lgbt human rights organizations such as aidspan and local ngos such as bring us rights and justice burj drawing on my personal interactions with sassoi participant observation autoethnography research at an ngo archival sources and critical analyses of documentaries on homophobia in africa such as the bbcs the worlds worst place to be gay i examine the racialized image of africa as the heart of homophobic darkness in lgbt human rights rhetoric engaging with the literary critiques of white humanism proffered by chinua achebe and james baldwinechoing sassoi stories and their experiences in relation to ngos that claim to highlight their precarious situations the nation-state and their immediate communities and families i argue that their subjectivity is analogous to what kwame gyekye the ghanaian philosopher calls amphibious identification gyekye stresses that amphibious personhood among the akan ethnolinguistic group of ghana is embodied by the adinkra symbol funtunfunefu-denkyemfunefu the siamese crocodile which epitomizes how self-making is neither reducible to the individual nor the community thus for him the individual while embedded in a group has room for self-assertion at a moment when ghana like the african continent is under pressure from western governments to embrace lgbt visibility there has been a backlash against such push from the nation-state civil society and conservative religious and moral publics in these shifting milieus sassoi who are corporeally effeminate adopt practices of the self parallel to gyekyes amphibious subject some of the spaces in which they enact effeminacy include rituals of transition such as birth ceremonies and even birthdays the significance of these events for sassoi practices of the self is often elided in the debates spurred by lgbt human rights discoursesagainst this backdrop i draw on the amphibian as an analytic to unpack the convoluted ways in which sassoi play with and along lgbt ngos desire to highlight their tragedies while rejecting such organizations efforts to identify them as lgbt their forms of queer self-making thus occur in the nervous conditions to use tsitsi dangarembas felicitous metaphor that are coterminously palimpsestic and contemporary amphibious subjects stages those complexities that lie beyond the pavlovian construction of africa as a homophobic safari in lgbt rhetoric a racialized projection and as primarily heterosexual in heteronationalist discourses an uncritical anthropological fallacy
