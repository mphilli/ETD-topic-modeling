z-selective wittig rearrangement stannyl ethers-alpha alkoxy stannanes-alpha mycotrienins a study of the stereochemical consequences of the still [23]-wittig rearrangement of various related secondary -lithio ether ethers is the focus of this dissertation unique to our work was the observation that trans -disubstituted olefins with a syn --alkoxy allylic relationship may rearrange producing cis -homoallylic alcohol products the ability to prepare compounds stereospecifically with z-olefins may provide an entry into the total synthesis of several natural products such as the immunosuppressive agent -discodermolide and the tumor cell migration inhibitor -migrastatinthe basis for our z-olefin stereocontrol is a reactive conformation that invokes a six-membered chelation between the -alkoxy group and the lithium cation prior to the [23] wittig rearrangement this relationship however required a transition state model where the stereochemistry at the migrating carbon was maintained contrary to literature precedent chiral -stannyl ethers were prepared in order to observe this stereochemical transfer and to determine whether the still [23] wittig rearrangement proceeds with retention or inversion of stereochemistrya highly convergent asymmetric synthetic approach toward the synthesis of -mycotrienol 1 the core 21-member macrolactam of this family will also be discussed members from the mycotrienin family of novel ansamycin antibiotics were first isolated in 1985 from a culture broth of streptomyces sp no 83-16the construction of two key synthons the c 8 -n 21 aromatic core and the c 1 -c 7 triene precursor will be described the synthesis of the c 8 -n 21 fragment will explore allenyl and propargyl metal addition to aldehydes in order to prepare a suitable homoallylic alcohol for further functionalization in preparation for a stille coupling the planned stille coupling would complete the carbon framework of the mycotrienol i core although calcium-based dissolving metal reduction allowed the cleavage of the c 17 benzyl ether bond in the presence of a terminal acetylene we found that it was more efficient to introduce the acetylene functionality after the c 17 bond had been cleaved the c 1 -c 7 synthon derived from -malic acid was transformed into a useful  ee -iodo diene in anticipation of the stille coupling
