curricula teaching educational software literacy reading instruction science education the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interactive hypermedia software on the comprehension of sixth grade students reading a science passage specifically two main questions were addressed 1 does hypermedia create a more supportive environment for comprehension when compared to traditional content area textbooks 2 which elements of hypermedia provide the most assistance to readersmore learning in and out of school is dependent on getting information from texts mckeown beck sinatra and loxterman 1992 it has been estimated that approximately 80 percent of the knowledge to which students are exposed comes from textbooks english 1980 recent research in the area of text structure has shown that a significant increase in comprehension occurs when elements of considerate text are applied to the writing of textbooks armbruster 1984 armbruster  anderson 1985 as the computer becomes an increasingly important learning tool in the classroom it is important to give attention to the structure of software programs being made for instructional usea study by david reinking 1988 found that student's comprehension increased with the use of computer-mediated text in computer-mediated text learners have the ability to control the text to facilitate understanding jonassen 1988 one form of computer-mediated text is interactive hypermedia interactive hypermedia programs provide assistance for students with poor decoding and comprehension skills hillinger 1992 information is presented using video sound text and graphics its non-linear structure allows the student to proceed through a lesson accessing information as needed leu gallo  hillinger 1993to study this issue 90 sixth grade students from a suburban middle school were selected they received one of three different treatment conditions reading traditional static text reading the original passage on the computer screen with additional color graphics used in the hypermedia version and the hypermedia version which contained supportive interactive features the topic of the selection was seasonal change the first question was analyzed using a one way analysis of variance the second question was analyzed using a 1 x 5 analysis of variancethe results of this study are useful for both researchers and practitioners while the use of hypermedia alone did not make a significant difference in the comprehension of a scientific principle it may be that the inclusion of refutational text with hypermedia may provide a more supportive environment for some kind of comprehension it seems that the development of new programs including the interactive elements and refutational text will help to increase comprehension of all students the average learner will have the ability to explore areas of interest which can be accessed by the touch of a finger the more reluctant reader who has hesitated to tackle an assignment due to past experiences of frustration and failure associated with the reading task will be motivated to continue to participate in the learning process
