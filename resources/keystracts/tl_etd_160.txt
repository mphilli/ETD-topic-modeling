mathematics education this study is a micro-ethnography describing the students' perspective of learning proof in high school geometry within the classroom setting the research design is based on modified analytic induction this procedure is employed when the focus is a specific issue in this case the issue is that of students' learning of geometry and proof to facilitate the mechanical aspects of coding and analysis the computer program qualog was usedthe study was carried out in one urban high school in new york four course ii sequential mathematics classes taught by three teachers were observed for an eight month period students were selected for interviewing consistent with the qualitative methodology employed in all 41 students were interviewed 13 9th-graders 23 10th-graders 5 11th-graders teacher interviews and classroom observations provided background information for the students' perspectivesfindings center on classroom routines the roles of teachers and classmates as well as on mathematical content student comparisons between mathematics and english and social studies classes defined listening as a strategy for learning mathematics students interpreted questions about mathematical content to reflect the classroom context in which they experienced learning mathematics for these students their understanding of mathematics was inseparable from their understanding of classroom lifeproof in geometry was seen as a process--a logical explanation--or a product--a series of steps proof was not seen as a tool for analyzing conjectures students did not speak about the meaning of proof theorems axioms definitions and geometry as an axiomatic system had no significance in writing proofs students saw proofs as textbook exercises with the goal being to complete them quickly students perceived a partially completed proof as incorrect to be correct a proof had to be completethe results argue that any research which focuses on learning must bring to the forefront the context in which the learning takes place one cannot understand the former without investigating the latter they further suggest that mathematics classrooms must change if students are to learn to think mathematically because teachers and classroom routines strongly influence students' beliefs about mathematics
