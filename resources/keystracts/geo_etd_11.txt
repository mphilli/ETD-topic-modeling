foliar nitrogen adirondack park new york shade tolerance this dissertation explores the relationship between the physical environment and the spatial pattern of the concentration of nitrogen in tree leaves or foliar n maps of foliar n are of great interest due to relationships among foliar n forest production and n cycling i propose that the spatial variability of foliar n is the outcome of a localized process involving species functional traits the environment experienced by the species and human' effect on that environmenti obtained species-level and whole-canopy foliar n data from a diverse set of seventy-five forest plots within the adirondack park new york these plots contained a wide range of variation in foliar n and six factors hypothesized to control its spatial distribution ie spatial controls species composition atmospheric n deposition disturbance history temperature moisture availability and bedrock geology i also used a subset of the field data and imagery from the hyperion hyperspectral sensor to predict whole-canopy foliar n with thirty-meter spatial resolution across two 185x77 km satellite imagesanalysis of the field and satellite foliar n datasets against descriptions of spatial controls obtained from field surveys and a geographic information system gis revealed that species composition was the primary control on the spatial pattern of whole-canopy foliar n in fact inter-specific variation in the functional trait of mean foliar n accounted for 93 of the variation in the field whole-canopy foliar n data the remaining intraspecific variability was related to all six hypothesized spatial controls and especially to the anthropogenic controls of n deposition and disturbance history interestingly the marked species differences in foliar n response to a single spatial control of n deposition or to multiple spatial controls were strongly related to species' functional traits of leaf mass per area lma and shade tolerance in sum i found the inter- and intra-specific sources of variability to explain 97 of the spatial variability in my field whole-canopy foliar n dataset given this evidence i strongly suggest that maps of foliar n can be further developed as tools to discover fundamental ecological principles and indicate ecosystem response to environmental impacts
