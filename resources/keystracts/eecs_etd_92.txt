cmos silicon on insulator deep space wireless communications there is a strong demand for wireless communications in civilian and military applications and space explorations this work attempts to implement a low-power high-performance fully-integrated receiver for deep space communications using silicon on insulator soi cmos technology design and implementation of a uhf low-if receiver front-end in a 035-m soi cmos technology are presented problems and challenges in implementing a highly integrated receiver at uhf are identified low-if architecture suitable for low-power design has been adopted to mitigate the noise at the baseband design issues of the receiver building blocks including single-ended and differential lna's passive and active mixers and variable gainbandwidth complex filters are discussed the receiver is designed to have a variable conversion gain of more than 100 db with a 70 db image rejection and a power dissipation of 45 mw from a 25-v supply design and measured performance of the lna's and the mixer are presented measurement results of rf front-end blocks including a single-ended lna a differential lna and a double-balanced mixer demonstrate the low power realizability of rf front-end circuits in soi cmos technology we also report on the design and simulation of the image-rejecting complex if filter and the full receiver circuit gain noise and linearity performance of the receiver components prove the viability of fully integrated low-power receivers in soi cmos technology
