evolutionary algorithms transportation graph representations airline scheduling a large number of optimization problems need to be solved in the field of transportation and have consirable industrial and practical significance the majority of these problems are multi-objective highly constrained due to regulations and physical limitations and np-complete in general even very little improvement in the solution 1 produces substantial profit as well as satisfaction of customers and employees traditional operations research or techniques are generally applied to solve these problems with recent interest in tabu search and evolutionary algorithms sophisticated modeling and transformation techniques have been proposed and studied this dissertation proposes a new approach to solve transportation problems hybridizing with previously known algorithms when appropriate we propose a new graph representation and operations to be applied on this representation using evolutionary algorithms we applied these ideas on the airline crew scheduling acs and vehicle routing with time windows vrptw problems we applied the new algorithms to many problem sets and demonstrate that the evolutionary algorithms with the new proposed representation are able to produce competitive solutions for these multi-objective highly constrained and np-hard problems
