altizer  thomas j j edwards jonathan death of god this dissertation explores the relationship between thomas j j altizer's christian atheism and jonathan edwards's christian theism it is organized around the idea of conversion as a response to a prior act of divine grace when altizer interprets nietzsche's death of god as such an act he expands the problematic of conversion to the level of theological discourse and thus brings it to bear on the distinctions of god transfiguration self conversion and world apocalypse the thesis argues that this linking of the death of god to that of man situates atheism at the end of a discursive sequence whose prior terms are theism and humanismaccording to altizer christian theology faces the choice of maintaining the traditional language of god's transcendence at the price of becoming blind to contemporary experience or falling silent by seeing that experience in response altizer turns his theology away from god's being towards god's speech by reading this turn through gilles deleuze's analysis of the visible and the speakable the dissertation recasts atheism's relation to the tradition in terms of systematically different forms of discourse altizer's tracing of the possibility of a christian atheism that is both visible and speakable to divinity's self-negation suggests an analogy with the theistic conception of grace i argue that edwards's theism produces the otherness of god through a continual veiling of its essence that is repeated in his understanding of the affections the trinity and the creation however such a discursive otherness can be differentiated from post-structuralism's absent transcendent signifier only indirectly altizer's analysis of speech for signs of god's death is best understood as an atheistic version of edwards's analysis of the affections for signs of god's transcendent grace although atheism has theism for its historical and discursive other altizer's total presence does not simply eliminate the other instead it marks the irreducible proximity of otherness as the becoming idiomatic of faith--at once the passing of theism's discourse and the recurrence of otherness as an alterity inherent in speech
