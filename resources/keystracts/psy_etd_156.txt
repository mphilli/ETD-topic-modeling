language familiarity reading behaviors visual search search patterns eye movements prior research indicates that subjects adopt a particular search pattern  during visual search tasks  these search strategies are influenced by a  variety of factors including color orientation size and distinctness  of stimuli  this project attempts to assess the level of influence  language fluency has on visual search tasks  experiments 1 2 and 3  assess whether visual search tasks are affected by prior learned reading  behaviors associated with particular languages  for these experiments  subjects were chosen based on fluency with hebrew and english  these  experiments used targets and distractors composed entirely of english  hebrew or symbols in different blocks  the experiments differed in the  layout of the stimuli ranging from grid format of single characters and  words to text like formats using words  language fluency groups were  assessed on biases in search patterns using an eye tracker  left-to-right saccades during a block of english stimuli and right-to  left saccades during a block of hebrew stimuli  results indicate a  strong influence of prior learned reading behaviors on eye movements  during visual searches  subjects displayed differential eye movement  patterns based on the stimuli for all three experiments   subjects  fluent in hebrew showed eye search patterns similar to patterns observed  while reading hebrew text during the hebrew block  during the english  block all subjects showed eye patterns similar to reading behaviors of  english text  the fourth experiment determined differences in reaction  times in a variety of conditions manipulating the language of the target  word and the language of the distractor words  subjects for this  experiment were chosen based on their familiarity with the languages  spanish and english of the stimulus words  the results from this  experiment indicate a reaction time cost for subjects fluent in both  languages of the stimuli  more attention is needed to distinguish  reaction time costs for bilinguals but this finding is consistent with  past research  this experiment failed to find a clear effect of  language fluency on search times for spanish words nor did we find  strong evidence of a linguistic pop-out effect  collectively these  results provide valuable insight into the interaction of reading and  visual search behavior
