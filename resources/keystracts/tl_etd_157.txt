mainstreaming autism special education elementary education curricula this study explores students' experiences with facilitated communication fc as one way of understanding the meaning and experience of inclusion in four elementary classrooms the study started as an exploration of the meaning of facilitated communication from the perspectives of students and educators however it gradually evolved into a study of the practices around inclusive education as the research participants interpreted implemented and used facilitated communication as an integral part of their efforts to create inclusive classroomsthe findings indicate that individual classroom teachers exercised tremendous power over the structure and functioning of their classrooms the findings also indicate that while disability was not central to the ways most classroom teachers perceived their students who used facilitated communication academic performance was this study revealed student participation did not increase in direct proportion to an increase in the number of adults assigned to a classroom student participation was facilitated largely by creative accommodations by classroom teachers and teaching assistants and by the way supports were assigned and usedthe data revealed that nondisabled students reflected their teachers' perceptions attitudes and behaviors with regard to their classmates with disabilities they tended to be very accepting of facilitated communication as a communication method used by some of their classmates students who used fc believed that while this communication method enabled them to participate in class and appear smart it also made them appear different most of the fc users indicated that they would still like to be able to talk so that they could be more like their classmatesthis study raised some important questions chief among them being whether the acceptance and valued image accorded to those who used fc was also extended to students who did not use fc and may therefore have been unable to participate in the core curriculum was the acceptance and inclusion of students tied too closely to being smart was this level of acceptance only for those who used fc and could therefore participate in classrooms events or did it extend to all students with disabilities these are important questions that remain to be explored
