assertion knowledge gricean accounts rule-constituted acts in chapter 1 i propose and defend an account of assertion and some closely related acts built upon the idea that asserting that p involves acting with the intention of producing evidence that one has activated knowledge of the fact that p this account vindicates the increasingly popular idea that there is a special connection between assertion and knowledgemost accounts of assertion are of one of two broad types on one type of account whose modern origin is paul grice's 1957 paper 'meaning' the core of asserting that p is acting with a certain structure of intentions my own account is a species of this 'gricean' type of account there is considerable variety among gricean accounts nearly all such accounts fail to discern any special connection between assertion and knowledge i am the first proponent of a gricean account to argue at length for the existence of such a connection and the first to provide a detailed explanation of that connectionin chapter 2 i survey a few gricean accounts each of which is in some way or another interestingly similar to my own in chapter 3 i argue that each of several gricean accounts on which making an assertion involves acting with an intention that 'refers to itself' is either fatally unclear or false chapter 4 is a critical study of some aspects of dan sperber and deirdre wilson's theory of communication their theory is broadly griceanon the other broad type of account assertion is a rule-constituted act that is an act that of its very nature involves the application of one or more rules chapters 5-7 are critical studies of three prominent examples of this type of account namely the accounts of william p alston timothy williamson and robert brandom
