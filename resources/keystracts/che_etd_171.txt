aminotroponiminates mesoporous silica fluorosilica nanocatalysts the use of the highly ordered mesoporous silica sba-15 as a scaffold for zinc aminotroponiminates znatos and aminotroponates znatis for the intramolecular hydroamination catalysis of non-activated alkenes was explored the cyclization reactions were found to result in 59-93  conversions in 8-12 h furthermore recyclability studies proved that multiple catalytic cycles could be performed without loss of catalytic efficiency the synthesis and characterization of highly ordered mesoporous fluorosilicas omfs which contain 24-70 wt f corresponding to a loading of 13-37 mmolg was also accomplished synthesis of these materials is carried out from parent mesoporous silicas mcm-41 and sba-15 under ambient conditions using dilute non-aqueous solutions of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate et 3  obf  4  fluorination of the mesostructures is accomplished with only minor alteration of the materials' overall order the described synthetic procedure is also applied to sulphonic acid -so 3  h functionalized sba-15 enhancement of the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening of styrene oxide in the presence of aniline to produce the corresponding -aminoalcohol by the fluorinated materials is presented reaction at room temperature after 4 h using - so 3  h functionalized sba-15 result in 77 conversion while the as-synthesized omf and omf-so 3 h materials exhibit 79 and 87 conversions respectively all material syntheses were characterized by compositional and structural analyses such as n 2  g sorption small angle powder x-ray diffraction xrd solid state 13  c and 29  si nmr ftir spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as well as elemental and thermogravimetric analyses
