generalized bounded variation generalized absolute continuity fourier series series this dissertation is devoted to the study of functions of generalized bounded variation generalized absolute continuity and the fourier series of such functions we begin by defining a generalized modulus of variation which we use to define a banach space \phiv h of generalized bounded variation functions which encompasses many spaces previously studied we show that this space contains only bounded functions with simple discontinuities and that it can be written as an intersection of the schramm spaces \phibv satisfying a certain condition we next show that \phiv h satisfies an analogue of helly's theorem and that if this space contains a function which is not of harmonic bounded variation then it does not satisfy the dirichlet - jordan theorem we then show that a theorem of zygmund may be generalized to \phiv h as well as a larger class of generalized bounded variation spaceswe turn our attention to fourier series by considering the sequence \\alpha\sb\rm kxf\  \\rm k\ b\sb k\ cos\ kx - k\ a\sb k\ sin\ kx\ where a\sb\rm k and b\sb\rm k are the fourier coefficients of the integrable function f we show that this sequence is not c1 summable for \phiv h functions if \phiv h contains a function which is not of harmonic bounded variation we show however that the series with terms \alpha\sb\rm kxf ie the formally differentiated fourier series is c1 summable to 12 f\sb\sp\primex  f\sb-\sp\primex if the difference quotient gt  1t fxt - fx is of harmonic bounded variation in a neighborhood of t  0 we also give conditions to insure uniform c1 summability of this seriesfinally we define three generalized absolute continuity spaces\lambdaac \lambdac and \lambda\sb2ac and study the relationships between them the space of absolutely continuous functions and the space of continuous functions of bounded variation bvc we show that bvc can be written as the intersection of the \lambdaac spaces and that the space of continuous functions can be written as the union of the \lambdaac spaces but that this cannot be achieved by countable intersections and unions we end by finding a bound for the fourier coefficients of \lambda\sb2ac functions
