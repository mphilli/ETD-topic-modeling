parity violating asymmetry moller scattering calorimeter this thesis reports on the e158 experiment at stanford linear accelerator center slac which has made the first observation of the parity non-conserving asymmetry in moller scattering longitudinally polarized 48 gev electrons are scattered off unpolarized atomic electrons in a liquid hydrogen target with an average q  2  of 0027 gev 2   the asymmetry in this process is proportional to  - sin  2  [straight theta]  w    where sin 2  [straight theta]   w   gives the weak mixing anglethe thesis describes the experiment in detail with a particular focus on the design and construction of the electromagnetic calorimeter this calorimeter was the primary detector in the experiment used to measure the flux of the scattered moller electrons and ep electrons it employed the quartz fiber calorimetey technique and was built at syracuse universitythe preliminary results from the first experimental data taken in spring 2002 give a pv  -1519  290 stat   325 syst  parts per billion this in turn gives sin 2 [straight theta] w  02371  00025  00027 which is consistent with the standard model prediction 02386  00006
