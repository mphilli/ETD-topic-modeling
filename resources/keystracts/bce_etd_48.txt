co-tpr spectra metal-support interaction the objective of my research has been to examine the effect of preparation procedures including metal concentration and ph of the impregnation solution on the catalytic properties and structures of supported-metal catalyst systemsdesign parameters have been identified for nial\sb2o\sb3 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and incipient wetness from nickel nitrate solution in contact with a \gamma-al\sb2o\sb3 support the metal dispersion activity for c\sb1 c\sb2 and c\sb3 formation under synthesis conditions and the carbon deposited during reaction have been shown to be predictable based solely on the properties of the electrolytes from which these catalysts were formedregardless of the method of preparation nial\sb2o\sb4 was found to be the only active ni species on low weight loading nial\sb2o\sb3 catalysts both ni and nial\sb2o\sb4 are present on high weight loading catalysts the high-temperature methane peak observed only from co-tpr spectra of low weight loading catalysts is due to nial\sb2o\sb4 the low-temperature peak that appears as the weight loading is increased is due to nisteady-state reaction kinetics for ch\sb4 production yield activation energies which increase with increasing weight loading the apparent activation energies for catalysts with a single methane peak in their co-tpr spectra were found to be normally distributed the apparent activation energies for catalysts with two methane peaks in their co-tpr spectra were found to also be normally distributed when the method of preparation was considered in testing the statistical nature of the distributiontitration experiments of the carbon pool subsequent to steady-state reaction of h\sb2 and co in conjunction with temperature-programmed surface reaction were used to assess the impact of ni speciation on the rate-determining step in the methanation reactionin situ esca experiments and microreactor studies were used to examine the existence of metal-support interaction msi between dispersed ni and the al\sb2o\sb3 carrier thermal treatment of a high weight loading nial\sb2o\sb3 catalyst in he resulted in the disproportionation of surface nial\sb2o\sb4 concomitant with al\sb\rm xo\sb\rm y \sb\rm n aggregates partially covering surface ni a subsurface layer of nial\sb2o\sb4 was found upon the removal of the alumina overlayer
