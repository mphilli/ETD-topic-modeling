marketing pricing policies supply chains profits studies many researchers assert that everyday low pricing edlp generally outperforms hi-low pricing hlp in many supply chains because edlp reduces demand distortion and improves supply chain profits while edlp strategies may be appropriate for products or services with constant underlying demand patterns some items such as clothes toys and bicycles have attributes that produce seasonal or fluctuating demand patterns when underlying demand is seasonal edlp strategies do little to stabilize demand if demand is price sensitive however hlp may help attenuate and stabilize the naturally occurring seasonal demand swings when the amplitude of the demand changes is dampened suppliers may need to make fewer or less extreme capacity changes thereby reducing production costs in this study we search for the operating conditions such as demand pattern demand amplitude customer price sensitivity production change cost structure and promotional cost structure that favor a hlp pricing strategy
