adh1b3 alcohol alcohol offers black college students peer norms racial discrimination alcohol behaviors among black college students may be explained by the interactive role of multiple risk and protective factors emerging evidence shows that the association of risky environments and drinking behaviors differs as a function of alcohol-metabolizing genotypes however studies have yet to examine the protective role of adh1b3 an alcohol-metabolizing gene found almost exclusively among black individuals in addition to genetic protective factors religiosity has been identified as a protective psychosocial factor against alcohol use despite exposure to risky environments  the current study examined the potential protective effects of the adh1b3 allele and religiosity on the relationship between risky environments and alcohol behaviors among black college students specifically this study sought to investigate the extent to which those genetic and psychosocial factors attenuate the association of alcohol-facilitating ie alcohol offers and perceived peer norms and stressful ie racial discrimination and negative life events environmental factors with alcohol behaviors participants were 241 black college students mean age  20 years 66 female who reported consuming alcohol at least once in the past 30 days  results demonstrated that the presence of an adh1b3 allele protects against alcohol use frequency when exposed to low alcohol offers and racial discrimination incidence rate ratio [irr]  114 124 respectively and negative drinking consequences when exposed to low alcohol offers and perceived peer drinking norms irr  121 141 respectively religiosity was shown to protect against alcohol use frequency in the presence of low racial discrimination irr  110 these novel findings add to the scarce literature of risky and protective determinants of alcohol behaviors among black college students
