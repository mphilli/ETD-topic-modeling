thermal comfort energy optimization an intelligent model is presented in this dissertation for improving individual thermal comfort in a building at lower energy consumption than can be achieved by a conventional system many researchers have shown that allowing building occupants to adjust their local environments to their liking improves their satisfaction and productivity in the workplace this idea has been called have-it-your-way hiyw in this study however the concern about the possible increase of energy consumption related to the implementation of distributed environmental control systems has limited the wide adoption of the application of such systems conditions for thermal comfort in human occupancy of indoor environments have been defined by standards and practices buildings' indoor environmental control systems are designed based on these standards to meet the thermal comfort needs of about 80 of the occupants such one-size-fits-all osfa systems employ only one or a few thermostats to provide a uniform environment for the whole populationour approach is based on the observation that an individual has a temperature range around his or her preferred temperature value in which he or she is comfortable with the surrounding thermal environment in this dissertation we take advantage of this fact to optimize temperature settings within the comfort zone of all occupants with energy consumption lower than that of a traditional osfa approach in order to formulate this optimization problem a static lumped parameter resistive building energy model which was developed by cosden has been utilized and a new measure for individual thermal comfort has been introduced inspired by fanger's studies this measure which is a departure from the population comfort model has been utilized as a basis for the simulation of individual occupants' thermal environmental preferencesimproved thermal comfort at lower energy consumption than is achieved by the conventional osfa systems has been obtained through optimization in a central fashion the optimization procedure requires a collection of all of the variables parameters and constraints of a system combined into a solution to the optimization problem the annual energy consumption has been reduced by 8 on average relative to the conventional systems while making all persons satisfied with their thermal environment this is a big improvement over the current standards whose target is to satisfy only 80 of the populationbecause of the dramatic increase in the computational complexity and time demand of optimization algorithms they may not be practical for high-dimensional complex applications an intelligent model here named intelligent modeling of optimized systems imos has been successfully developed to imitate the behavior of a large number of optimized solutions to the individual thermal comfort and energy optimization problem our intelligent model has reduced annual energy consumption by 6 relative to the conventional osfa systems without making anyone dissatisfied by reducing the number of system variables in a distributed fashion in order to predict an optimal solution to a system variable imos only utilizes the variables which most directly affect that variable rather than utilizing all the variableswith respect to the concern about increased energy consumption due to the utilization of personal environmental control it has been shown that the thermal comfort of occupants in a building can be improved without increasing the energy expenditures--or even reducing expenditures--of indoor environmental control systems iecs through this optimization or introduced modeling approach
