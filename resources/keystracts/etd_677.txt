 we take ourselves to have some knowledge about whats right and wrong to do but how easy is this knowledge to get in the first two chapters of this dissertation i argue for the novel conclusion that it is harder to have moral knowledge than non-moral knowledge due to the fact that moral beliefs have more practically at stake more specifically in chapter 1 i argue that moral beliefs are subject to a higher epistemic standard than non-moral beliefs roughly epistemic standards mark how good of an epistemic position an agent needs to be in in order for her beliefs to receive epistemic credit like knowledge the higher epistemic standard of moral beliefs offers the only unified explanation to date of long-standing puzzling asymmetries between moral and non-moral epistemology like how moral testimony unlike non-moral testimony is problematic and moral expertise unlike non-moral expertise is non-existenteven so one may wonder why moral beliefs have such a higher epistemic standard in chapter 2 i argue that the best account of what fixes the higher epistemic standard for moral beliefs is a practical-stakes account wherein the practical upshots of holding a belief affect how demanding the standard is importantly my account differs from traditional practical-stakes accounts of epistemic standards first it locates features of morality as a subject matter like being subject to the reactive attitudes and the way that moral beliefs typically motivate whereas non-moral beliefs dont as that which functions to raise the standard second the stakes that are relevant outrun those stemming from the interests of the individual person whose belief is under assessment and include the practical interests of other agents this last feature makes the picture of moral knowledge i offer essentially social as whether or not one has moral knowledge depends in part on the interests of others in the end the view i offer in these chapters presents a perhaps surprising picture of moral epistemology as systematically different from non-moral epistemologyin chapter 3 i investigate in more detail the social basis of moral knowledge by considering one particular view of the nature of moral facts constructivism according to this view moral facts are determined by what would be the result of a hypothetical choice procedure amongst an idealized group of agents here i argue that the best moral epistemology on offer for the constructivist requires an agent to be able to respond to the objections that relevant others would have to the content of ones belief in order for that belief to count as knowledge in this way moral knowledge for constructivists requires the ability to reason together with others about moralityafter considering social constraints on moral knowledge in chapter 4 i turn to consider whether normativity may likewise have a social basis here i consider social-based views of normativity wherein an agents reasons for action are determined by the social institutions practices and relations iprs she takes part in i argue that existing views have trouble ensuring that certain intuitively bad social practices--namely oppressive ones--arent a source of reasons in light of this i develop a novel positive view looping social constructivism according to which an agents reasons are a function of the iprs she takes part in after they are idealized specifically they are idealized such that each role in the ipr has the same ability to determine how rights responsibilities and power are distributed across the ipr looping social constructivism is able to avoid issues of oppressive iprs given its unique use of idealization on the social level instead of idealizing the individual agents taking part in an ipr we idealize structural features of the ipr itself
