biodegradable composites elastomers shape memory thermoplastic there is a need for biodegradable thermoplastic elastomers for a variety of medical applications this dissertation aims at i developing and characterizing biodegradable elastomers and ii developing and characterizing biodegradable smart composites both to be used as biomaterials first in chapter 1 an overview was given of the literature of relevant background information on polymers biomaterials and previous biodegradable elastomers and responsive elastomeric systemsthe first biodegradable elastomer developed and investigated as presented in chapter 2 is a novel thermoplastic polyurethane that has a biodegradable soft segment and a crystalline hard segment poss by varying the composition of the polycaprolactone-based soft segment as well as the soft segment to hard segment ratio the thermal and mechanical properties could be controlled increasing the comonomer glycolide or dl-lactide content caused a decrease in the thermal and mechanical properties while increasing poss caused an increase in these properties overall the synthesized polyurethanes had low moduli high strain-to-failure and high elasticityin chapter 3 these polymers were degraded in vitro in phosphate-buffered saline pbs solution to investigate their properties throughout degradation it was found that increasing the amount of comonomer glycolide or dl-lactide in the soft segment increased the rate of degradation at 37 c the mechanical properties of all materials with comonomer decreased before 12 w even if  95 of the initial mass remained  interestingly different trends were seen in the 60 c degradation study  all materials tested lost their mechanical properties by 4 w while materials with dl-lactide decreased over time the material without comonomer saw a sharp decrease in mass after almost no mass loss during the first weeks of degradationthe poss-based polyurethane elastomers were then tested for cytocompatibility using a non-contact cell viability assay in chapter 4 it was found that all of the materials developed in chapter 2 had low cell viability therefore it was hypothesized that residual tin catalyst tin-poms from synthesis was causing this cytotoxicity a study was performed systematically varying the tin catalyst used to synthesize pcl1kposs polymers were synthesized with 1  001 wt tin-poms 01  001 wt  dibutyltin dilaurate or processed with repeated dissolutions and precipitations to try to wash away the tin  it was found that the polyurethane synthesized from lowest concentration of tin-poms catalyst 001 wt  had the best cell viability without compromising the mechanical propertiesthe biodegradable elastomeric polyurethanes and a thermoplastic semi-crystalline polymer polycaprolactone were combined by dual-electrospinning and compaction to fabricate a smart composite chapter 5 presents the processing and characterization of these shape memory elastomeric composites or smecs the composites had high elasticity and extensibility while having shape memory capabilities or the ability to fix into a temporary shape and return to its original shape upon heating these materials were tested extensively for thermal mechanical and shape memory properties for different compositions increasing polycaprolactone generally increased thermal properties mechanical properties and fixing next a single composition was degraded at different fixed strains it was determined that up to 100 fixed strain had no effect on the smec degradation profilein order to produce lower-cost biomaterials a second type of polyurethane was developed that utilized different length polycaprolactone diols as both the hard and soft segments and is presented in chapter 6 these materials had a higher modulus than the poss-based materials but had high elasticity one composition because of its high molecular weight and therefore high entanglements had shape memory propertiesfinally in chapter 7 conclusions and future directions for this work was presented
