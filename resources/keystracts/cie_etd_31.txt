calcium treatment elemental analysis hot water extractable organic matter molecular mixing model nmr soil organic matter the northeastern usa has a long history of acid rain which has  impacted soil fertility and raised concerns about the sustainability of the  forests in the region to facilitate recovery of these forests calcium  addition in the form of wollastonite was evaluated as a remedial tool at  hubbard brook experimental forests in new hampshire usa in order to study the  effects of these amendments on soil organic matter and soil microbes i  characterized the structural chemistry of soil organic matter som and its  hot-water extractable organic matter hweom fraction for hubbard brook soils  and studied the changes in the structure of som and hweom after short- and  long-term calcium amendment i found that the cn ratios for these soils were  272 and 228 in oi and oe horizons respectively and ranged from 208 to 226  in the oa horizon hot-water extractable organic matter hweom which was 339  of soil c in oi horizon and 093-114 in oe and oa horizons had much lower cn  ratios than whole soil values at 191 in oie horizon 148 in oe horizon and  135-148 in oa horizon this pattern suggests that hweom contains an abundance  of microbially derived organic matter the hweom also exhibited higher hc  ratios and a position in van krevelen diagram closer to carbohydrates compared  to the whole soil nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analyses revealed that hweom  was higher in o-alkyl c 50-70 than the soil from which it was extracted  40-55 further indicating its richness in carbohydrates which was also  confirmed by a molecular mixing model the soil organic matter decreased in its  o-alkyl c and carbohydrate proportion with soil depth due to decomposition and  increased in its refractory fraction represented by alkyl c and lipids  proportion these patterns were opposite in hweom indicating an increased  solubility of residual carbohydrate structures during the course of  decomposition the hweom was richer than soil in both labile organic matter and  microbial biomass though microbial biomass could account for no more than 40  of the extracted cin a short-term calcium treatment study i found a decrease in the  hweom content of soils treated with high amounts of calcium 4250 kg caha but  not in low ca 850 kg caha treatments two years after the treatment this  decrease was attributed to a decreased extractability of labile water-soluble  structures represented by hweom and not due to significant changes in som  structure as revealed by a biodegradation study and nmr spectroscopy the  biodegradation study showed that the hweom extracted from high ca treated plots  showed no significant difference in degradation compared to the reference plots  indicating that once extracted the hweom structures are bioavailable nmr  spectroscopy revealed no significant changes in o-alkyl structures in calcium  treated plots for the whole soil but showed a decrease in the o-alkyl c content  of hweom again suggesting that only the extractability of the labile structures  has been affected cn ratios also were not found to differ between reference  and ca treated plots phosphorous treatment with or without extra calcium did  not bring any significant effects on the structural composition of the soil  organic matter in the long-term 7-9 years calcium treatment effects were only  visible in the high-elevation sprucefirzone and not at lower  elevations
