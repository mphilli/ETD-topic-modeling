computer-supported collaborative learning distance education knowledge sharing virtual learning teams this study asserts that knowledge sharing a component of knowledge management in distance education virtual learning teams vlts is important for successful collaborative learning and that various factors characterizing person and environment can impact vlt members' knowledge sharing behavior factors under the category of person are vlt members' competencies for working on vlts and their learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation factors under vlt environment are social presence in the vlt the vlt learning community satisfaction with the vlt task type and instructor strategies knowledge sharing is defined as a behavior in which vlt members impart their expertise insight or understanding to other members in the vlt or to the entire team intending for the recipients to have that knowledge in common with themselves the sharers the study used bandura's 1986 model of triadic reciprocal causation as a theoretical framework the model is suitable for this research because it considers relationships between person environment and behavior first the study identified variables that are directly related to knowledge sharing next the study validated those constructs after the constructs had been validated they were entered into a knowledge sharing measurement model the study empirically tested a measurement model with five latent variables taking into account the measurement error next the study cross-validated the model with multiple groups drawn from the same sample the sample consisted of data from 1374 participants matriculated in graduate and undergraduate programs at an online university the data were analyzed using split sample methodology multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling techniques factor analysis and latent variable structural equation modeling- sem the study's findings suggest that there is a direct predictive relationship between knowledge sharing and competencies for working on vlts learning environment social presence task type and mediating relationships for learning community social presence and task type in the knowledge sharing model this study contributes to research theory and practice it concludes by presenting a knowledge sharing model that can be reevaluated with distance education student populations at various kinds of distance education institutions
