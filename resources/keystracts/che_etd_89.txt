solution conformations tripeptides cyclosporins vibrational circular dichroism vibrational circular dichroism vcd spectroscopy was used to investigate the solution conformations of a series of protected tripeptides z-ala-phe-val-ome and z-ala-leu-val-ome of dll ldl and lll configurations in ccl 4 solutions at temperatures of 25c 5c and -5c in the amide i region and 25c and -5c in the nh-stretching region additionally vcd was used to investigate solution conformations of 1 cyclosporins a c d g and h in cdcl 3  in the amide i and nhoh-stretching regions and 2 their corresponding magnesium complexes in cd 3 cn in the amide i region vcd spectra are sensitive to the chiral arrangement of co and nh bonds in intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded conformations calculations of geometries and ir and vcd intensities of model cyclosporin fragments as well as model tripeptides were carried out at the hartree-fock hf 6-31g basis set and density functional theory dft bpw91 functional6-31g basis set levels calculations were also carried out on model dipeptides only at the hf levelsolution spectra for the tripeptides indicate that there are multiple conformers present in solution the ldl tripeptides appear to have only one dominant conformer present as evidenced by similarity in ir and vcd spectra at all temperatures studied calculations support that there is only one low energy conformer a trans c 7 -c 7 ring cis ester orientation computational studies on the dll tripeptides are in agreement with observed data that more than one conformer is present for the dll tripeptides two low energy conformers are present in solution trans c 7 -c 7 ring cis ester and trans c 5 -c 5 ring cis ester the vcd spectra provide evidence that the lll tripeptides aggregate in solution the appearance of an intense negative low frequency vcd feature in the amide i and nh-stretching regions is indicative of a -sheet structure observed data is reproduced in the dft calculation for dimer and trimer aggregates the low energy conformer of the lll tripeptide is the extended structure trans c 5 -c 5 ring cis ester which can undergo self-associationfor the cyclosporins the good agreement between ir and vcd spectra from experiment and dft calculation provides evidence that the crystal conformation of cyclosporin a is dominant in cdcl3 solution spectra from the nhoh-stretching region of the free cyclosporins indicate that conformers with both free and hydrogen-bonded nh and oh groups are present in solution the ir and vcd spectra for the magnesium-complexed cyclosporins are indicative of strong interactions between cyclosporin and magnesium cation
