quantum electrodynamics quantum chromodynamics chiral field theory pion scattering we revisit the treatment of the multiflavor massive schwinger model by non-abelian bosonization we compare three different approximations to the low-lying spectrum i reading it off from the bosonized lagrangian neglecting interactions ii semi-classical quantization of the static soliton iii approximate semi-classical quantization of the breather solitons a number of new points are made in this process we also suggest a different effective low-energy lagrangian for the theory which permits easy calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitudes it correlates an exact mass formula of the system with the requirement of the mermin-wagner theoremmassive two-flavor qed\sb2 is known to have many similarities with two-flavor qcd\sb4 we compare the \pi - \pi scattering amplitudes actually an analog process in qed\sb2 of the two theories the qed\sb2 amplitude is computed from the bosonized version of the model while the qcd\sb4 amplitude is computed from an effective low energy chiral lagrangian a number of new features are noted for example the contribution of the two dimensional wess-zumino-witten term is structurally identical to the vector meson exchange contribution in qcd\sb4 also it is shown that the qed\sb2 amplitude computed at tree level is a reasonable approximation to the known exact strong coupling solutionit is shown that the potential functions for the ordinary linear sigma model can be divided into two topographically different types depending on whether the quantity r \equiv m\sb\sigmam\sb\pi\sp2 is greater than or less than nine since the wigner-weyl mode r  1 and the nambu-goldstone mode r  \infty belong to different regions we speculate that this classification may provide a generalization to the broken symmetry situation which could be convenient for roughly characterizing different possible applications of the model it is noted that a more complicated potential does not so much change this picture as add different new regions
