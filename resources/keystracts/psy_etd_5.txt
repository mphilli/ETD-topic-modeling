expressive writing theoretical mechanisms written emotional disclosure intervention content effects writing instructions expressive writing ew interventions encourage individuals to express their thoughts and emotions through writing about a stressfultraumatic event and are associated with various physical and psychological benefits recently ew interventions have tested a range of altered intervention content such as focusing on perceived benefits of past stresstrauma or trying to facilitate emotional processing no studies to date have experimentally tested altered intervention content to establish if such instructions systematically and reliably produce the response intended the purpose of this study was thus to manipulate ew intervention instructions to investigate if content alterations change the process of writing and participant responses community and student participants  n  204 were randomized to 1 of 6 groups representing different ew instructions that are commonly used in experimental disclosure studies these include instructions thought to elicit greater processes of cognitive-processing exposure self-regulation and benefit-finding each modified group was compared with a standard ew and an emotionally-neutral control group participants wrote for 20 minutes once a week for 3 weeks short-term outcomes included writing content and pre-to-post writing changes in salivary cortisol and mood the experimental groups differed from the control group on immediate outcomes in expected ways however altered instructions produced both intended and unintended responses compared to a standard ew group some intervention manipulations produced responses that differed from standard ew instructions as expected cognitive-processing based instructions lead to more cognitive-processing  p  0001 and instructions that promoted self-regulation and benefit-finding lead to more positive affect  p  's003 in contrast some intervention manipulations produced unanticipated changes on processes thought to be associated with other writing instructions for example exposure-based instructions lead to more extensive emotional habituation over time  p  04 but also promoted the unanticipated response of greater cognitive-processing  p  04 these results suggest that altering ew instructions to presumptively target specific processes works since most intended processes were shifted as intended importantly however altered instructions also elicited processes inconsistent with theoreticalclinical predictions which suggest that altering ew instructions to tailor intervention content seems to activate multiple processes thus modified intervention instructions may elicit a much wider range of mechanisms than those thought to be unique to one instructional set
