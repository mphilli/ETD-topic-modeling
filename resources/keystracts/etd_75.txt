air separation ceramics composite oxides methane oxidation oxygen permeation membrane perovskite oxides in recent decades ceramic membranes based on mixed ionic and electronic conducting miec perovskite-structured oxides have received many attentions for their applications for air separation or as a membrane reactor for methane oxidation  while numerous perovskite oxide materials have been explored over the past two decades there are hardly any materials with sufficient practical economic value and performance for large scale applications which justifies continuing the search for new materials  the main purposes of this thesis study are 1 develop several novel srcoo3- based miec oxides srco1-xmxo3- based on which membranes exhibit excellent oxygen permeability 2 investigate the significant effects of the species and concentration of the dopants m metal ions with fixed valences on the various properties of these membranes 3 investigate the significant effects of sintering temperature on the microstructures and performance of oxygen permeation membranes and 4 study the performance of oxygen permeation membranes as a membrane reactor for methane combustionto stabilize the cubic phase structure of the srcoo3- oxide various amounts of scandium was doped into the b-site of srcoo3- to form a series of new perovskite oxides srscxco1-xo3- sscx x  0-07  the significant effects of scandium-doping concentration on the phase structure electrical conductivity sintering performance thermal and structural stability cathode performance and oxygen permeation performance of the sscx membranes were systematically studied  also for a more in-depth understanding the rate determination steps for the oxygen transport process through the membranes were clarified by theoretical and experimental investigation  it was found that only a minor amount of scandium 5 mol doping into the b-site of srcoo3- can effectively stabilize the cubic phase structure and thus significantly improve the electrical conductivity and oxygen permeability of the srcoo3- membrane  among all the disk-shaped sscx x  0-07 membranes with a thickness of 091 mm both ssc005 and ssc01 exhibit the highest oxygen permeation rate of about 32 mlcm-2min-1 stp at 900 oc ssc01 also shows excellent cathode performance for a solid oxide fuel cell  therefore ssc01 is of special interest and thus investigated regarding the performance as a membrane reactor for methane combustion  the performance was evaluated based on the results of methane conversion rates and co2 selectivityinspired by the above findings a series of mixed-conducting perovskite oxides srco095m005o3- scm m  bi5 zr4 ce4 sc3 la3 y3 al3  zn2 were prepared to study the effects of different dopants m on the performance of srco095m005o3-  it was found that the m cations significantly affect the crystal phase structure grain growth membrane porosity electrical conductivity and the oxygen permeability of the scm membranes  specifically it is postulated in this study that the formation of the cubic perovskite structure is dependent on the electron configuration in the outer orbits of m cations which may provide theoretical guidance for future development of high oxygen permeation ceramic membranes based on the perovskite materialsto study the significant effects of grain sizes on the oxygen permeation behaviors of la06sr04co02fe08o3- lscf and srsc01co09o3- ssc01 membranes the lscf and ssc01 membranes were sintered at various temperatures to form different microstructures  properties of these membranes with varied grain sizes were compared  results showed that the oxygen permeation rate of the lscf membrane increases with increasing the grain size however it is interesting that the oxygen permeation rate of the ssc01 membrane decreases with increasing the grain size  this implies that oxygen transport occurs more however less rapidly along grain boundaries than through the bulks in the lscf and ssc01 membranes respectivelya lscf hollow fiber membrane and a ssc01 planar membrane were applied as membrane reactors for methane combustion  to improve their performances lscf powder and ssc01 powder were dip-coated and spray-coated on the permeation sides of lscf hollow fiber membranes and ssc01 planar membranes respectively  the exhaust gas components were analyzed by gas chromatography gc  the performance was evaluated based on the results of methane conversion rates and co2 selectivity  the highest co2 selectivity of the lscf hollow fiber membrane and the ssc01 planar membrane is about 88 and 85  respectively  this indicates that the application of an oxygen permeation membrane as methane combustion reactor is feasible
