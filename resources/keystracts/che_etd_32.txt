wittig rearrangement discodermolide hydroboration the application of the [23] wittig rearrangement to the total synthesis of -discodermolide is the subject of this dissertation -discodermolide is a unique polyketide that was isolated in 1990 and was found to have impressive anti-tumor activities -discodermolide is under phase i clinical trials as a potential antitumor drugbackground information and stereochemical consequences of the [23] wittig rearrangement are discussed examples of the application of the [23] wittig rearrangement to the total synthesis of natural products are described as are previous total syntheses of -discodermolide also presentedconsiderable effort has been focused on the construction of fragments a c1-c8 b c9-c13 and c c15-c21 of -discodermolide the syntheses of each fragment begins with a common intermediate prepared from z-2-buten-14-diol a [23] wittig rearrangement of the common intermediate followed by hydroboration installs the c4 c5 and c7 stereocenters in fragment a fragment b is synthesized in a single step fragment c is prepared by applying a [23] wittig rearrangement followed by hydroboration the alkylation of a tertiary allylic alcohol with tributyltin methylene iodide is improved the selective deprotection of a di-tbs ether is realized possible routes for completion of the total synthesis of -discodermolide are proposed
