political epistemology truth dialectical materialism political epistemology is a research project about how politics frames the questions of knowledge as a strategic activity to make the production of truth meaningful ethically valuable and politically emancipatory it promotes a new understanding of the theory-practice relationship and seeks an epistemological criterion of truth that is attentive to the political conditions that determine meaningfor epistemic as well as political reasons we need a normative criterion of truth the project of political epistemology articulates this normative criterion of truth new coherence  as the relation of mutual support among the superstructural and the structural elements of reality new coherence is new since it transcends the traditional coherence theory of truth that defines truth as logical consistency among propositions moreover the criterion of new coherence is new since it goes beyond not only the web of propositions but also the present reality new coherence has to do with openness towards the possibilities of reality being otherwise than it is in the presentthe main theme of the investigation is to ask the following if karl marx theodor adorno hans-georg gadamer and jacques derrida were to clarify further their implicit as well as different epistemological positions and ontologies of truth would their works significantly contribute to the project of political epistemology my dissertation argues that these thinkers advance a more or less similar articulation of the relationship between truth and politics and of political epistemological normativity in other words despite these thinkers' important differences there is still a shared political understanding of knowledge of the epistemic normativity and of the theory-practice relationship among them while hoping to respect their differences this study attempts to offer a hybrid paradigm that involves all these significantly different figures through dialectical materialist readings of their works each chapter explores the contribution of a particular thinker to the project of political epistemology
