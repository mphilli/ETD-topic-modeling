atm networks taxonomy host-network interfaces the performance of parallel and distributed applications running on network of workstation resources suffers from high latency and low throughput even when the network speed is in the giga bitsecond range the main reasons for the low performance are due to the design of the host-network interface and the software mechanisms that are used to transmit data from the host to the network and vice versain this dissertation we have reviewed host-network interface designs and propose a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize and describe the architectures of host network interface in the architectural context we have described the main components used to implement the host-network interface functions and how they interact with each other in the protocol context we have discussed how the software functions data copying packetization error handling flow control routing are mapped into the main host-network-interface components identified at the architecture levelwe have also provided several examples that show how our taxonomy can accurately describe the architectures of host-network interface and characterize the performance limitations of any host-network interface designs as wellwe support the design of host-network interface systems with the quantitative performance model which is derived from the comprehensive taxonomy above all our designs in host-network interfaces are motivated by a desire for increased performance so it is instructive at this point to consider how the host-network interface system could achieve better performance
