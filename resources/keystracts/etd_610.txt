adhd assessment impairment malingering symptom validity recent research on adult onset attention deficithyperactivity disorder adhd has led to an increase in evaluations of college students and adults suspected of the disorder as well as increased concern that some may feign or malinger adhd characteristics in order to obtain a diagnosis and associated incentives eg stimulant medications and academic accommodations  faking adhd is especially easy when the diagnosis is based on self-report symptoms-only rating scales  diagnostic accuracy improves with the assessment of symptoms impairment and symptom validity but this type of comprehensive self-report measure is currently not available  the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a newly constructed multidimensional adhd rating scale mars comprised of adhd symptom functional impairment and symptom validity indexes  the mars self-report items were completed by three groups of college-aged students  participants with adhd n39 and non-adhd controls n62 completed the mars honestly  a group of non-adhd participants n56 were instructed to malinger adhd  results indicated that malingerers reported more symptoms and impairment than adhd participants and both groups reported more symptoms and impairment than controls  the symptom validity index was able to differentiate malingerers from adhd participants with high sensitivity and specificity these preliminary results suggest that measures that combine symptoms impairment and symptom validity could be useful additions to adhd rating scales
