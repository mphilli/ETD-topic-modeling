beam modulation system dithering analysis methodology elastic electron scattering helicity-correlated beam asymmetry neutron radii in heavy nuclei parity-violating asymmetry over the past decade in hall-a of the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility tjnaf both the happex and prex collaborations have carried out various high-precision polarized elastic electron scattering experiments to explore the nuclear structure the nucleon form factor and the weak charge of proton and electron they have done so through the technique of the parity-violating asymmetry measurement with limited theoretical uncertainties my dissertation focuses on the study of nuclear structure namely the thickness of the neutron skin using elastic electron scattering experimentsthe direct measurement of the thickness of the neutron skin in heavy nuclei where neutron are two-fold more than protons constrains the slope of changes in binding energies of every single heavy nucleus with respect to the full nucleus density including proton and neutron densities in addition a more precise description of the neutron density profile for each heavy nucleus can help us gain better understanding of nuclear binding energies and has astrophysical implications for neutron stars as far as we know the proton and charge rms root-mean-square radii in heavy nuclei such as lead 20882 pb have been measured with an accuracy of 002 fm and 0002 fm respectively however there is no clear picture of the neutron density profile through a high precision neutron rms radii measurement free from the strong interaction until nowthrough a series simulations both theorists and experimentalists have studied the sensitivity of the parity-violating asymmetry to the extraction of the neutron radii in heavy nuclei under some specific conditions for instance a fixed scattering angle of 5 degrees and a fixed q2 of 00088 gev2 a 3 statistic uncertainty of parity-violating asymmetries corresponds to a merely 1 error of the neutron radii in lead 20882 pb that is the uncertainties of neutron radii in lead 20882 pb is three-fold smaller than the error of the parity-violating asymmetry since mar 2010 we performed the first electroweak experiment to probe the neutron radii in lead 20882 pb the normalized parity-violating asymmetries after addressing false asymmetries background asymmetries to the 90 partially polarized electron beam and the momentum-transfer q2 is 0656  006stat  0014sys ppm part-per-million which corresponds to the thickness of the neutron skin of 033016-018 fm one of the most significant systematic uncertainties results from the discrepancies in beam parameters such as position angle and energy on the target leading to the difference in the differential cross-section between two helicity states the helicity-correlated window-to-window or pulse-to-pulse beam asymmetries thus arise my primary contribution to this experiment is to establish an analysis strategy used to control the size of the helicity-correlated beam asymmetries during the data-taking period this analysis is especially addressed in chapter 6in sum the neutron radii of 033016-018 fm in lead 20882 pb supports the existence of the neutron skin in the neutron-rich matter a second future run will yield a much higher precision neutron radii measurement moreover the strong correlation between the neutron skin in lead 20882 pb and the neutron start radius indicates an approach from nuclear physics to understand the astrophysical equation of state eos for a neutron star
