electrostatic gold nanoparticles polyoxometalate poms self assembly nanoscience has shifted its focus from studying properties of individual nanoparticles toward using these nanoparticles as building blocks to assemble larger systems one approach to this end is to exploit electrostatic self-assembly through the interaction of oppositely charged nanoparticles to form larger superstructures and even crystalline superlattices metal nanoparticles such as gold have been used to design such structures but understanding the mechanics of the self-assembly can be elusive due to their random size and charge distributions however a certain class of polyoxomolybdates can provide insights into how electrostatic self-assembly occurs with their precise size dimensions and chargesin the first investigation the electrostatic assembly between a series of the differently charged polyoxomolybdate-type keplerates of nh442[movimovi5o21h2o612mov2o4ch3coo30] 300 h2o   10 ch3coonh4 mo-132a nh472[movimovi5o21h2o612mov2o4so430]  200 h2o mo-132b and na10nh462[movimovi5o21h2o612mov2o4hpo430]  300 h2o  2na - 2nh4  4 h2po4 mo-132c with cationic gold nanoparticles aunps was explored for the first time the rapid electrostatic assembly from nanoscopic entities to micron scale aggregates was observed upon precipitation which closely matched the point of aggregate electroneutrality successful assembly was demonstrated using uv-vis dls tem and zeta-potential analysis results indicate that the point at which precipitation occurs is related to charge balance or electroneutrality and that counter-ions at both the mo-132 and aunp play a significant role in assemblythe subsequent investigation focused on certain counterintuitive results of the previous study of mo-132 and aunp aggregates by manipulating the aunp core diameter we hypothesized that a aunp core diameter of comparable size to mo-132 would lower the re0 equivalence molar ratio r  [mo-132][au] between the nanomaterials whereas a larger aunp core would raise the re0 the range of sizes allowed assessment of how counter-ions affect assembly based on comparable dimensions of the nanomaterials it was found that a smaller aunp core size of 16 nm produced the naively anticipated results based on charge yielding a re0 molar ratio of ca 10 at electroneutrality however even at this favorable re0 unorganized aggregates were observed these findings suggested that crystallization could not be based on charge considerations alone but that the size relation between the nanomaterials must also be taken into account to induce crystallizationin the last investigation the electrostatic self-assembly of the polyoxomolybdate nh428[mo154no14o420oh14h2o70] 350 h2o mo-154 and aunps of different size was studied to explore the aspect of asymmetry in these colloidal systems the aim of this work was to observe the dependence electrostatic interactions may have on asymmetric shaped nanomaterials the ring-shaped mo-154 structure gave this study a unique view on how the polarity of electron density can affect the molar ratio r  [mo-154][au] it was shown that the van der waals attraction forces of mo-154 in comparison to mo-132 were stronger resulting in a lower re0
