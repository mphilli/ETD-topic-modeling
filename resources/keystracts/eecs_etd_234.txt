computer science many physical systems are characterized by a set of first order ordinary differential equations odes or by a set of first order delay differential equations ddes with proper initial conditions these systems are called stiff if the solution contains both rapidly and slowly varying components in this work we study linear multistep lms methods or lagrange-methodlms-method pairs suitable for the solution of stiff initial value problems for odes and ddes for the former we introduce lms methods either with better stability characteristics--aalpha-stable with increased alpha--or with smaller truncation error coefficients than backward differentiation formulae bdf for ddes palphabeta-stability which is defined with respect to the archetype equation y't  pyt  qyt-tau is the property which is used to compare the stability of lagrange-methodlms-method pairs it is shown that the stability of lagrange-methodbdf pairs can be improved not only by replacing bdf with a more stable lms method--increasing alpha--but also by using a set of lagrange interpolators rather than a single one to interpolate the solution at the several delayed time points of the lms method--reducing betasince the performance of the lms methods discussed herein depends on the problem being solved and the time span in which the integration is taking place we have used a set of methods in the code the code automatically changes the method together with the order
