dynamic compression reverberant speech hearing aid the dynamic characteristics of compression attack time at and release time rt have been shown to temporally alter speech signals the current study examined the effect of atrt on the intelligibility and clarity of reverberant speech in a laboratory and field studythirty listeners with sensorineural hearing loss were monaurally fitted with a siemens triano3 behind-the-ear hearing aid programmed in linear at  0 ms rt  0 ms fast compression at  9 ms rt  90 ms and slow compression at  900 ms rt  1500 ms settings low-predictability speech-perception-in-noise sentences were presented at four reverberation times rt60s to simulate an anechoic room rt 60  0 s living-room rt 60  06 s classroom rt 60  12 s and hard hall rt 60  36 s sandridge newman spitzer  katz 2005 twelve listening conditions 3 atrt settings  4 rt 60 s were tested intelligibility scores were based on correct identification of the last word in each sentence listeners also rated the clarity of the sentences using a subscale of the judgment-of-sound-quality measure gabrielsson schenkman  hagerman 1988in the field trial twenty of the 30 listeners were binaurally fitted with the triano3 hearing aids listeners wore the triano3 for one week set in syllabic compression and one week set in dual compression in a random order also listeners kept a journal of their listening experiences and completed the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit aphab cox  alexander 1995 after each week at the end of the field trial listeners identified the setting they preferredthe primary results from this study were 1 intelligibility scores and clarity ratings of reverberant speech were similar regardless of atrt 2 reverberation significantly reduced speech intelligibility and clarity across all hearing-aid settings 3 slow atrt yielded greater real-ear aided response than fast atrt despite the same prescribed gain 4 aphab and journal entries showed greater benefit for syllabic compression than dual compression 5 85 of the listeners preferred syllabic compression over dual compression and 6 listeners who obtained low intelligibility scores of reverberant sentences demonstrated high benefit in everyday listening wearing syllabic compression
