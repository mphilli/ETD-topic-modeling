energy transfer nanomaterials quantum dots in this thesis i explain the synthesis photophysical properties self-assembly and energy transfer of quantum dots qdots firstly i demonstrate the core and coreshell type qdots synthesis using microwave-induced hydrothermal approach and discussed their optical properties hydrothermal temperature could be achieved and aqueous processing was greatly facilitated allowing for the qdot size control narrowing size distributions and improved quantum yields i next discuss the dna-mediated self-assembly study of qdots in the view of the resonance energy transfer the ssdna was firstly functionalized on the cdsezns qdots and gold nanoparticle aunp surface through several different approaches in chapter three frster resonance energy transfer fret method was applied to explain the qdot pl spectral changes when it is combined with the organic fluorophore and elucidate this qdot-dna-fluorophore structure in chapter four cdsezns qdot pl quenching and recovery system was demonstrated by introducing the dna functionalized aunps here the dna-mediated self-assembly was applied and nanometal surface energy transfer nset analysis performed to explain this qodt-aunp interactions pl quenching and recovery was detected and the separation distance was considered for qdot-aunp assembly structures in chapter five i discuss on the qdot pl quenching with au auag and aupd nps considering surface plasmon resonance spr signatures further inner filter effect was considered with specific stern-volmer constatns lasty i demonstrate the solid support assembly of multi-color qdot clusters using dna-mediated self-assembly cdsezns qdot was phase-transferred into aqueous buffers through amphiphilic polymer wrapping and ssdna was functionalized on resulting aqueous qdots pl recovery of two qdot peaks was clearly shown indicating the successful formation of multi-color qdot clusters and qdot to qdot ratio can be systematically regulated upon initial introducing amounts of qdots
