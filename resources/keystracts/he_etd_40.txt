nursing students student retention this was a longitudinal study of the retention of one specific cohort baccalaureate nursing students the study was not based on a single theory of student retention and there are no known multiinstitutional theories the purpose of the study was to explore student and institutional characteristics to determine whether there was a relationship between the predictor variables and a student's decision to persistence in the programthe sample which was drawn from the 1971 and 1980 cooperative institutional research program surveys consisted of 279 women the retention rate was 57multiple linear regression was used to solve a series of hierarchical regression equations eight variable sets were added one at a time until all were entered into the equation student background variables educational aspiration variable personality and value variables institutional variables financial aid variables interpersonal interaction variables transfer variable and college achievement variable the overall equation was statistically significant at the05 level with an f 28 250 ratio of 3211this system model explained 265 of the variance in the criterion variable persist three variables were statistically significant at the05 level institutional control satisfaction with the institution of initial entry and the number of institutions attended attending a private institution was the most powerful predictor b 228 transferring to another college had a negative effect on persistence b  -219 the results have implications for students institutions nursing organizations and government officials first this study demonstrated that the retention rate of students at private colleges was 25 higher than students at public schools second transferring to a second college decreased persistence by 15 third being very satisfied with one's initial college as opposed to being not satisfied increased persistence by 34the findings indicated that 1 persistence in nursing is more a function of students' institutional experiences than precollege characteristics and experiences and 2 the structure of persistence or is similar for nursing students as it is for college students in general these results have implications for policy curriculum development and enrollment management strategies
