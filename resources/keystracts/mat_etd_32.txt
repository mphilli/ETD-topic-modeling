biting convergence null-lagrangians euler-lagrange equations calculus in the calculus of variations it is essential to work with weakly sequentially compact spaces due to the lack of reflexivity of the space [special characters omitted]  given any bounded sequence  f j     [special characters omitted]  we cannot guarantee the existence of a subsequence which converges weakly biting convergence comes to the rescue when the only available information about a sequence in [special characters omitted] is its boundedness this notion of convergence has been designed mainly to deal with bounded sequences in [special characters omitted] that fail to be equi-integrable we give a new proof of the theorem of k zhang [ z  ] on biting convergence of jacobian determinants for mappings of sobolev class [special characters omitted]  the theorem states that given a bounded sequence of functions   f j     [special characters omitted]  there exists a subsequence [special characters omitted]  such that [special characters omitted] converges in the biting sense to j   x    f   the novelty of our approach is in using [special characters omitted] -estimates with the exponents 1 [special characters omitted] p   n   as developed in [  is1 il i1  ] these rather strong estimates compensate for lack of equi-integrabilitywe extend this result to more general wedge products of differential forms and then to null-lagrangians null-lagrangians are characterized by euler-lagrange equations if the value of the energy integral [special characters omitted] [ f ]  [special characters omitted] does not change by adding to f a function that vanishes on the boundary of [special characters omitted]  then the function e is called a null-lagrangian elliptic complexes hodge decomposition and non-linear commutators play a vital role in our proof
