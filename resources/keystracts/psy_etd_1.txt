autism developmental disabilities transition school psychology kindergarten the transition to kindergarten for students with disabilities presents educators and family members with many challenges as students shift from early childhood education settings to elementary school settings in order to facilitate a successful kindergarten transition it is suggested that families and educators create collaborative home-school partnerships that bridge early education home and elementary school environments children with developmental delays dd may require additional supports as they transition to kindergarten due to their special needs in particular children with autism spectrum disorders asd given their significant deficits in communication and social functioning along with restricted or repetitive behaviors may require more comprehensive transition supports than children with other developmental delays however there are few empirical studies that focus on transition to kindergarten for students with disabilities therefore the goal of this study was to compare kindergarten transition practices in preschool children with asd   n   19 and children with other developmental delays  n   76 as reported by both parents and preschool teachers results suggest that although parents with a child with asd reported significantly more concerns regarding the transition to kindergarten there were no differences in parent involvement in transition preparation activities or teacher provided activities an additional goal was to compare group differences in the stability of parent-reported parenting stress and child behavior across the transition period from spring of the preschool year to kindergarten entry in the fall parenting stress and child behavior problems were relatively stable across time study findings are discussed in the context of future research directions and interventions to help facilitate smooth kindergarten transitions for young children with disabilities
