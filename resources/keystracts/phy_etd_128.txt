classical percolation isostatic network k-core quantum percolation tricritical point percolation is the study of connected structures in disordered networks as edges are randomly and independently added to the network clusters of neighboring edges grow in size until there ultimately exists a percolating cluster the emergence of this percolating cluster exhibits properties of a continuous phase transition the simplicity of uncorrelated percolation makes it the ising model of connectivity-driven phase transitions this thesis documents a quest to go beyond uncorrelated percolation and investigate transitions in correlated percolation models where there are constraints on the addition of edges or vertices such constraints are inspired by glassy and jamming systems for example more specifically we discuss several correlated percolation models the k-core model on random graphs and the spiral and counter-balance models in two-dimensions---all exhibiting discontinuous transitions yet with diverging correlation lengths---in an effort to identify the needed ingredients for such a novel transition we also construct mixtures of these models to interpolate between a continuous transition and a discontinuous transition to search for tricriticality then to capture both the local and global mechanical stability properties of disordered particle packings we work towards building jamming graphs via the henneberg construction this construction is another example of a correlated percolation model since there are constraints on the addition and removal of edges jamming graphs provide for a more rigorous way to define the jamming transition for repulsive soft spheres as well as a starting point to understanding how the local and global mechanical properties interact and characterize the system in addition we study quantum transport properties along these disordered networks with correlations in the connectivity and investigate how such correlations affect for example the transition from insulator to metal as the percolating cluster emerges treating each occupied edge as a quantum scatterer and invoking the random phase approximation we find for k3-core networks on the bethe lattice a connected loop-free graph that the random first-order phase transition in the connectivity also drives the onset of quantum conduction giving rise to a new type of metal-insulator transition finally we conduct level spacing analysis to go beyond the random phase approximation this analysis reiterates our findings of a new random first-order phase transition in the world of disorder-driven metal-insulator transitions
