debugging design by contract mutation testing requirements discovery software testing software visualization we introduce a methodology and research tools for visual exploratory software analysis verdicts combines exploratory testing tracing visualization dynamic discovery and injection of requirements specifications into a live quick-feedback cycle without recompilation or restart of the system under test this supports discovery and verification of software dynamic behavior software comprehension testing and locating the defect origin at its core verdicts allows dynamic evolution and testing of hypotheses about requirements and behavior by using contracts as automated component verifierswe introduce semantic mutation testing as an approach to evaluate concordance of automated verifiers and the functional specifications they represent with respect to existing implementation mutation testing has promise but also has many known issues in our tests both black-box and white-box variants of our semantic mutation testing approach performed better than traditional mutation testing as a measure of quality of automated verifiers
