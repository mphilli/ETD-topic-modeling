vibrational circular dichroism raman optical activity ketoconazole itraconazole miconazole vibrational optical activity voa spectroscopies are employed to probe molecular structure vibrational circular dichroism vcd measurements in conjunction with computational modeling are used to determine absolute configurations of three different fungicides the reported configuration of -ketoconazole is confirmed to be 2 r 4 s  and the absolute configuration of -itraconazole assigned to be 2 r 4 s  and -miconazole to be  s  in addition vcd measurements and computational modeling provide insight into the mechanism of vcd intensity enhancement for ligand-bound metalloproteins containing open shell metals vcd measurements identify heme modes being enhanced for azide- and cyanide-bound metmyoglobins with open-shell ironiii centers dft calculations of six heme models using the lanl2dz and wachtersf basis sets demonstrate the importance of the chiral environment of the heme in addition to an open shell ironiii species in the generation of larger anisotropy ratios of ligand stretches and vcd intensity enhanced vibrations below 1500 cm -1 the advanced spectroscopies used to obtain spectral data display performance levels of current instrumentation data obtained in vcd measurements of the proteins myoglobin albumin lysozyme and concanavalin a show a new level of spectral quality in ft-vcd measurements the vcd spectra obtained display a high signal-to-noise ratio and can be used to identify protein structure at a quantitative level raman optical activity roa measurements demonstrate the limitations of current instrumentation in the acquisition of spectra of the proteins albumin and lysozyme spectra obtained demonstrate the problem of fluorescence in current dcp i roa measurements
