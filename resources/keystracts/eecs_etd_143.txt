vcr quality of service video servers this dissertation addresses the issues of designing a video server with the capability of supporting a variety of vcr operations a number of issues make the design of a video server difficult first a video server should simultaneously provide video services to multiple clients and guarantee the quality of service for each client second a video server should manage system resources including cpudiskmemory and schedule network activity so as to maximally utilize resources while not overloading the system finally a video server should be able to support a variety of vcr operations such as playback fast-forward slow-forward pause resume indexing and scrolling furthermore a user watching a video should be able to change from one service to another--for example from playback to fast-forward or from playback to slow-forward a video server should support these dynamic service changes while efficiently utilizing system resources this dissertation proposes a scaleable approach for integrating cpudisknetwork scheduling and memory management into a single framework under which we can systematically manage system resources and optimize individual resources to achieve this objective we have developed a number of techniques and modeling methodologies for analyzing the behaviors of disk accesses network operations and cpu activities under the loads of both single client and multiple simultaneous clients as well as the behaviors of interactions or interferences between disk accesses and network operations we also present a way to utilize information about all the system resources in our admission control strategy in order to determine if a set of video services is acceptable the proposed hierarchical relationship of service transaction and session together with a finite state machine model allows us to support efficiently a wide range of vcr operations and service changes
