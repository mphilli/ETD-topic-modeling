attention deficit hyperactivity disorder performance feedback goal-setting interventions children children with adhd have demonstrated significant academic problems and are often at-risk for school failure in particular math seems to be an area of difficulty for children with adhd although academic problems are prevalent in children with adhd few studies have investigated the efficacy of school-based interventions to increase academic success the intent of this study was to use performance feedback and goal setting as an intervention to increase the mathematics fluency of 7 children 5 boys 2 girls in fourth and fifth grades who have attention-deficithyperactivity disorder the specific purposes of this study included 1 examining the efficacy of performance feedback [ie digits correct per minute presented both verbally and graphically] and goal setting as an intervention to increase math fluency for children who have adhd 2 determining whether the method of goal setting that is either self-selection or experimenter assignment of goals has a differential effect on math fluency 3 exploring whether the performance feedback and goal setting interventions facilitated generalization to higher math skills and 4 assessing student acceptability of the performance feedback interventions an alternating treatments single-case design was used to explore the efficacy of two performance feedback and goal setting interventions these interventions incorporated two different methods of goal setting 1 student-selected goal setting and 2 experimenter-assigned goal setting differentiation among treatment methods was only obtained for two students but the performance of most students improved albeit to varying degrees generalization of math skills was only evident in one case and all students rated both interventions as highly acceptable results suggested that performance feedback and goal setting interventions may be an effective intervention for children with adhd and that method of goal selection may be important for some students but not others additional research identifying effective school-based interventions to improve academic outcomes for children with adhd is recommended
