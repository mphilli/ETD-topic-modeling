image segmentation level set methods belief propagation radial basis functions in this dissertation we investigate structural similarity belief  propagation and radial basis functions in level set based image  segmentation in order to separate the objects from the background the  level set method uses image features such as edges and contrasts to  derive differential equations for segmentation in general segmentation  most of the parameters in level set methods are empirically determined  we first propose a novel level set method which formulates a cost  function to minimize the structural similarity between objects and  background the parameters in our approach are automatically determined  according to the image information during the evolution of level set  secondly in order to apply user information into interactive  segmentation to detect a specific target in the image we develop a  level set based algorithm to handle human interaction during  segmentation in our method belief propagation is used to spread out  the user information according to the local level set the experimental  results indicate that our method is robust to objects with high shape  variation and inhomogeneous intensity appearance the evolution of level  set often involves solving partial differential equations using finite  difference method which is time consuming and complicated we present an  alternative method using radial basis functions to evolve the level  set where the centers and the number of basis functions are determined  based on a mathematical approach we validate our methods by evaluating  the segmentation results of different kinds of images and by comparing  them qualitatively and quantitatively with those from other relevant  methods
