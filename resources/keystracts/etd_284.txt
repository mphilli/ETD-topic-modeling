andean piedmont arid soils clumped isotopes geothermometry pedogenic carbonate td47 the clumped isotope geothermometer estimates the formation temperature t 47 of carbonates and has tremendous potential to enhance the extraction of environmental data from pedogenic soil carbonate in the geologic record however the interpretation of pedogenic carbonate t47 data is limited by uncertainties in our understanding of carbonate formation processes this study examines the potential for along-strike same elevation and plant biomass c3c4 site variability to influence pedogenic carbonate t47 data pedogenic carbonates were collected from five modern soil pits in the semi-arid eastern andean piedmont of argentina under a summer precipitation regime three of the five soil pits were instrumented with soil temperature and soil moisture sensors to a depth of 1 m at 1 km elevation while a fourth was instrumented with an additional soil co2 sensor and atmospheric sensors temperature relative humidity insolation and rainfall at 06 km elevation t47 values are statistically indistinguishable between the four instrumented sites and are invariant with depth the mean t47 is 31c  4c  1se reflecting summer soil temperatures soil moisture and temperature data indicate that isothermal conditions are achieved immediately after significant wetting events carbonate formation under these conditions could result in our observed hot isothermal t47 values the results of this study constrain carbonate formation to the early part of soil drying with t47 interpretations biased to soil conditions just after major precipitation events
