empathy historical inquiry inquiry primary sources school libraries teaching the ability to analyze alternative  points of view and to  empathize understand the beliefs attitudes and  actions of another from the  other's perspective rather than from one's  own are essential building blocks  for learning in the 21st century  empathy for the human participants of  historical times has been deemed  by a number of educators as important for the  development of historical  understanding the classroom teacher and the school  librarian both  have a prominent stake in creating educational experiences that  foster  the development of perspective empathy and understandingthis case study was designed to investigate the idea that  teaching  with primary sources and historical novels during historical inquiry   enhances students' development of cognitive and emotive empathy the  study was  framed around two research questions how do classroom  teachers and school  librarians design and teach historical inquiry  using historical novels and  primary sources what is the impact of  teaching with historical novels and  primary sources on the development  of historical empathythe case study was conducted in an englishhistory humanities  block  and the school library in a new york city secondary school data were   collected through classroom observations interviews with the classroom  teachers  and librarian and samples of student work on the use of  primary sources and  historical novels the study found that primary  sources must be surrounded by  context to be useful to students in their  learning that secondary sources were  necessary for providing that  context and that historical fiction provides  social context but its  use must be scaffolded to help students distinguish  fiction from fact  in addition the study found that unless library linkages to  primary  sources are embedded in classroom instruction they are not used by   students or teachersin answer to the second research question the study found that   primary sources have a strong impact on the development of historical  empathy if  their use is mediated by a teacher or librarian and that  cognitive empathy must  be developed before emotive empathy finally  this case study showed that a  school librarian's effectiveness is  diminished by fulfilling a resource-provider  role with no integration  into classroom instruction
