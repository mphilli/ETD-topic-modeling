monte carlo psychological tests statistics complete-case cc pairwise available-case pw and maximum likelihood ml missing data methods were compared in a monte carlo experiment a multivariate normal distribution observations missing at random and a monotone pattern of missingness was assumed there were three blocks of variables that form the monotone pattern of missing data the parameters of interest were the mean vector variance and covariancethe sample centroid and sample variance-covariance matrix were generated directly an algorithm developed by odell and feivesan 1966 was used to generate the variance-covariance matrix the mean vector was generated by sas' rannor functionthe exogenous variables were the number of variables within each block correlations among the variables initial block's sample size and attrition percents the average root mean square error rmse was the criterion used to analyze the results of the monte carlo experiment a split plot factorial spf-2222-3 with four between factors and one within factor was conducted three times once for each parameterthe attrition percent was successful in discriminating among the missing data methods with the mean and variance the other exogenous variables did not discriminate among the missing data methodsfor the mean pw is recommended for the 20 attrition rate ml is recommended as the first choice for the 40 attrition rate followed by pw for the variance pw is recommended for both the 20 and 40 attrition ratesthere was no interaction between the missing data methods and any of the exogenous variables for the covariance
