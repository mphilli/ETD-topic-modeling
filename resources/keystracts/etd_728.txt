consumer amenity immigrants job colocation labor markets marriage markets phd workers this dissertation comprises two papers that examine the employment outcomes and location choices of phd-trained individuals that often face dual-thin marriage and labor markets the first paper investigates the degree to which single phd-trained workers both domestic and foreign-born face trade-offs between marriage and labor market opportunities when job markets are not geographically overlapping with marriage markets single phds may be forced to choose between metropolitan areas msas that offer better employment opportunities versus better marriage markets i find significant evidence of a sorting effect  the local marriage market is a location-specific consumer amenity for which highly trained foreign-born singles may sacrifice real wage in equilibrium to access a more active dating environment the second paper uses differencing strategies to compare the location choices of foreign-born versus domestic-born phd-trained workers results suggest that single foreign-born phd workers are partly willing to forgo the greater labor market opportunities found in large msas in exchange for a more active dating scene in contrast findings on married foreign-born phd workers echo those from costa and kahn 2000 that highly educated couples are disproportionately drawn to large msas in order to solve their job market co-location challenge
