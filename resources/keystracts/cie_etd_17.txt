aluminum hubbard brook experimental forest new hampshire acid rain organic carbon this study describes i the long-term trends in the chemistry and speciation of aluminum al in soil solutions and stream waters ii the landscape controls on the concentration of al species in streams and iii al biogeochemistry in forest floor soils in the hubbard brook hb valley in new hampshirelong-term changes in drainage water chemistry varied with position in the landscape in bs soil solutions at mid- to higher elevations declines in the sum of concentrations of strong acid anions c a  2[sulfate so 4 2- ]  [chloride cl - ]  [nitrate no 3 - ] and smaller declines in the sum of concentrations of base cations c b  2[calcium ca 2 ]  2[magnesium mg 2 ]  [sodium na  ]  [potassium k  ] were accompanied by decreases in concentrations of inorganic monomeric al al i  with little change in ph these changes probably reflect the release of c b and al i through exchange mechanisms in response to changing inputs of mobile acid anionsin most streams sampled in this study there was evidence of aloh 3 control on al solubility exceptions to this mechanism occurred at stream sites where dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were elevated for all streams forest floor depth and drainage area together explained much of the variation in concentrations of total monomeric althere was a strong relationship between organic monomeric aluminum al o  and doc concentrations in i the long-term record for soil solutions and ii stream water sampled across the hb valley furthermore there was strong evidence of organic matter control on al solubility in the forest floor modeling scenarios indicated that organic binding sites in the forest floor are far from saturated with al furthermore al does not appear to limit the retention of increased ca inputs to the forest floor which has important implications for the remedial application of ca to forest soilsdespite these findings there may be continuing stress to forest biota from elevated al concentrations this is particularly true at mid-to higher elevations where al concentrations in fine root tissues are highest and where ca 2 al i ratios in bs soil solutions are persistently low molar ratio 1
