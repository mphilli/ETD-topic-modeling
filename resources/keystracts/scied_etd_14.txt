exercise children diabetes insulin injection the purposes of this dissertation were to examine the effect of pre-exercise insulin injection site on post-exercise blood glucose bg concentration in children with insulin dependent diabetes iddm physiological component and to explore the knowledge and attitudes related to diabetes mellitus dm and exercise guidelines of selected children with iddm parents of iddm children and physical education pe teachers survey componentin the physiological component 14 normally active iddm children 8 male 6 female completed 2 treadmill exercise bouts 30 minutes at 65 of v0\sb2 peak using either an arm or leg insulin injection site prior to exercise although exercise prompted significant p05 bg reductions over time 60 minutes post-exercise a 2-way anova indicated that bg values were not significantly different pns between injection site trials however leg injection resulted in 7 cases of post-exercise hypoglycemia as compared to 2 cases of hypoglycemia with arm injection it was concluded that similar trends in bg concentration are observed for up to 60 minutes post-exercise whether an arm or leg injection site was used and that the greater incidence of post-exercise hypoglycemia occurring between 60 to 120 minutes post-exercise following leg injection as compared to arm injection may have been due to a difference in insulin receptor mechanics in exercising musclein the survey component 25 iddm children 28 parents and 32 pe teachers completed the 20 item diabetes  exercise knowledge and attitude test dekat along with a brief informational survey of their personal background and iddm history responses to the dekat indicated that noticeable knowledge deficits of dm and exercise guidelines were present in all three groups with overall scores on the knowledge items being 360 for iddm children 264 for parents and 231 for pe teachers a chi square analysis indicated that there was a significant difference between groups on overall score for the knowledge items and that iddm children and their parents performed better on level-1 knowledge items basic concepts than on level-2 and level-3 items which required the application of basic dm and exercise concepts to a daily dm management regimen the dekat also uncovered several dm and exercise concepts that appeared to be well understood poorly understood or in need of resolution by future research
