knowledge production chile environmental policy salmon production salmon farming this research explores how scientific explanations of the expansion of the salmon farming industry in los lagos region shape environmental policies that regulate them and affect regional development projects the central question is to what extent do struggles over knowledge about natural resources affect environmental policy outcomes in the los lagos region chile  this research takes a political economy and political ecology approach to explain why certain policies are privileged instead of others and what role science and research have in those decisions methodologically is based on 10-months of fieldwork in chile specifically in santiago valparaso puerto montt valdivia chilo and nearby localities where actors of knowledge production environmental policy and the salmon industry are located i used a mix-methods design that included archival work interviews participant observation and mapping what this case reveals is that the predominance of discourses supporting nature's exploitation oriented the kind of research promoted as well as the political solutions that prioritized economic development over environmental protection although the scientific community may be better aware of the extent of environmental degradation they still work within the discourse of nature's resources as the source of chile's development thus the struggle over the role of nature in development is not framed in terms of why we are using natural resources but how and knowledge production is developed accordingly creating a blind spot for decision makers and scientists interested in contributing to environmental policies
