alaska range apatite fission-track apatite u-thhe nenana gravel plate tectonics thermochronology the research presented here seeks to constrain the multiple episodes of uplift and denudation contributing to the formation of the alaska range the approach will be to determine the thermal history 30 ma to the present of the central and eastern alaska range both temporally and spatially mechanisms of deformation resulting in periodic episodes of rock uplift along an intracontinental strike-slip margin may be constrained by investigating and understanding patterns of exhumation through time throughout the central and eastern alaska rangethe southern alaska continental margin is a complex boundary defined by active subduction and accretion of numerous terranes including the yakutat microplate the formation of a distinct volcanic arc system and the development of major intracontinental strike-slip fault systems the alaska range is located 500 km inland of the active plate margin along a major continental strike-slip fault system the denali fault system dfs the high topography of the central alaska range south of the dfs occurs where its mckinley strand changes from a mainly east-west orientation to a southwest-northeast orientation the high topography of the eastern alaska range lies to the northwest of the junction between the hines creek strand of the dfs and the main dfs strand to the south i propose two approaches to resolve the thermotectonic history of the mountain range 1 direct sampling and quantification of the thermal evolution of the range itself including the central and eastern segments through low-temperature thermochronologic study of basement rocks and 2 thermochronologic study of sediments of the nenana gravel and usibelli group in adjacent basins where deposition is related to the erosional unroofing of the alaska rangechapter onethe goal is to constrain the lower temperature and hence more recent cooling history of the region and to determine whether there was variation episodicity in the exhumation rate since the late miocene as well as to examine the exhumation record across the dfs  the chapter revisits the same sampling set used in the original fitzgerald et al 1995 study applying u-thhe apatite ahe thermochronology and hefty thermal modeling to evaluate the newer techniques against the old ahe thermochronology was applied to samples in the broader mckinley area to better constrain regional exhumation patterns in relation to the master strand of the denali fault and to look for a predicted increase in regional exhumation rates associated with a trend in late cenozoic cooling the general results of the ahe dating and the thermal modeling support the initiation of rapid cooling at 6 ma conclusion of the original aft studyanother goal of this chapter is to better constrain the timing of onset and rate of exhumation of the northern foothills ie terrain north of the dfs as well as the central alaska range there is also evidence of an earlier but less significant period of cooling at 10 ma denali fault proximal cooling age trends suggest northward propagation of deformation that may be accommodated along previously unmapped thrust faults contrary to previous thermochronology work in alaska there is no evidence of an increase in exhumation rates after the introduction of glaciers to the region 3 ma in the current thermochronology data set the over-all new data supports the earlier conclusion of initiation of rapid exhumation related to a change in oblique convergence of the southern alaska block hefty modeling combined with the vertical transect approach provided additional constraints on the regions thermal historychapter twothe southern alaskan continental margin has been tectonically active since at least the cretaceous 65 ma including ridge subduction 65-50 ma yakutat microplate translation beginning 30-25 ma yakutat collision 10 ma-present with a decrease in subduction angle to flat slab beginning at 10 ma microplate rotation southern alaska block and pacific plate motion changes relative to the north american plate at 25-20 12-10 and 5-6 ma tectonic events along this southern margin resulted in intracontinental deformation and the development of the alaska range along the curved right-lateral strike-slip denali fault system dfsin addition to higher-temperature thermochronologic methods applied to constrain the earlier thermal history of the eastern alaska range ear low-temperature thermochronology on basement rocks of the ear is being applied to constrain the more recent thermal history and formation of the modern day range  apatite fission-track aft ages from north and south of the dfs located at and around nenana mountain range from 43-09 ma a distinct break in slope the base of an exhumed partial annealing zone in the nenana mountain vertical profile at 6 ma indicates the onset of rapid cooling with an average cooling rate of 20-30cmy and exhumation rate 1 kmmy since that timeapatite u-thhe ahe ages from multi-grain aliquots range from 40-1 ma for samples north and south of the dfs in general all but three ahe ages are consistent with rapid cooling due to exhumation from 6-1 ma the ear low-temperature thermochronology data has similarities with that from the western and central alaska ranges namely the onset of an episode of rapid cooling at 6 ma interpreted as rapid exhumation and uplift to form the modern day alaska range we have yet to differentiate changes in cooling rates for ahe andor aft ages 6 ma and hence better constrain the younger exhumation history of the rangewithin the chapter i relate the near synchronicity between the onset of rapid cooling and exhumation in the central and eastern alaska range 6 ma along the denali fault with plate motion change between the pacific and north american plates plate motion change and an increase in relative convergence at 6 ma led to a greater-normal component of collision of the yakutat microplate at the same time as its more buoyant southern half of continental affinity entered the southern alaskan subduction zone this relationship either initiated or enhanced counterclockwise rotation of the southern alaska block lying north of the plate boundary and south of the dfs changing the partition of strain along the dfs as well as causing thrusting along faults that splay off the dfs eg susitna glacier thrust fault all of these tectonic components contribute to the transference of stress from the active subduction zone to the dfs along which the alaska range was formed and where uplift exhumation and deformation continues todaychapter threethe aim of this chapter is to constrain multiple periods and patterns of denudation along an intra-continental strike-slip fault system that may then be related to specific tectonic periods of compression accommodated by the northward propagation of basin growth and development ruiz et al 2004 reiners and brandon 2006 ridgway et al 2007 the location and subsidence of interior basins located from northwestern canada to eastern alaska have been inferred to be controlled by the geometry of the neighboring major convex faults and the state of stress along these faults ie denali tintina and border ranges fault systems shultz and aydin 1990 by evaluating the distribution of locally reduced mean stresses through the use of a boundary element model the development and subsidence of tertiary interior basins can be explained by a combination of forcesthe two main controlling factors on these basins include the geometry along major convex-shaped right-lateral faults and the state of stress and the change in that stress though time along these faults during the tertiary based on plate motion vectors of note is the conclusion that rotation due to oroclinal bending did not prove a sufficient mechanism by itself to induce right-lateral slip and therefore result in enough mean stress to induce basin subsidence according to the model  trop et al 2007 examined the development of the wrangell volcanic field wvf intra-arc basin during the miocene based on analysis of the frederika formation ff and ffwvf lavas it was concluded that wvf intra-arc basin development overlapped with the cessation of strike-slip basin development and magmatism in the eastern wvf 10 ma and is consistent with a diachronous collision of the yakutat terrane against the northern pacific margin as a result of the uplift of the alaska range sediment shed off the system was deposited to the north of the range within the neogene tanana and cantwell basinsdefined periods of compression and northward propagation of thrust-top basin development can be related to tectonic driving mechanisms operating along the margin ridgway et al 2007 these periods of unroofing should be defined by the decomposition of apatite fission-track cooling ages of samples collected throughout the tanana basin stratigraphy the goal of this chapter is to interpret links between depositional and deformational processes ie exhumation cyclicity andor episodic events as related to the tectonic evolution of the collisional southern alaska convergent margin deciphering the evolution of mountain belts and plate movements can be accomplished by combining basin analysis with exhumation research
