ostracism online communication exclusion many of us are reliant on remote forms of communication eg email texting etc that provide the opportunity to participate in more varied and frequent social interactions whether such communication methods affect the quality of social connections is critical to the study of interpersonal interactions exclusion being isolated from others has been associated with outcomes such as negative affect lowered self-feelings aggression etc thus the question arises whether being excluded via online interactions are similar or different from being excluded in-person previous work suggests that although both mediums produce more negative feelings in response to being ignored ostracism that online ostracism may buffer or protect threats to one's self-esteem and sense of control that arise from being ignored furthermore there is evidence that gender may influence some aspects of exclusion men and women feel similar aversive responses to ostracism but differ in how they cope with exclusion specifically women are more likely to report decreased self-esteem following exclusion than men particularly when exclusion occurs in-person a two-part study was conducted to examine reactions to exclusion as they occur within these two mediums study 1 investigated people's anticipated reactions to ostracism either in-person or in a chat room participants in study 2 were randomized into either in-person or chat room ostracism conditions overall participants predicted ostracism would cause psychological distress and this occurred similarly across the mode of ostracism study 2 revealed decreases in positive affect following ostracism however participants reported a decrease in negative affect and little change in self ratings comparison between the two studies revealed that people anticipate ostracism as being more negative than is actually experienced overall females reported significantly lower post-ostracism positive affect and inclusion levels than males females also reported marginally lower post-ostracism self-esteem than males males and females however did not report differences in any outcomes as a function ostracism medium in general these studies suggest that remote forms of communication are perceived as similarly meaningful avenues of interaction eg particularly when the interactions are with strangers future research should examine whether this may be generalized to individuals with less familiarity with this technology
