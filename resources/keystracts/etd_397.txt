active learning forensic science pogil a causal-comparativequasi experimental study examined the effect of incorporating a hybrid teaching methodology that blended lecture with process oriented guided inquiry lessons pogils on the overall academic achievement of a diverse student body in a large lecture setting additional considerations included student gender ethnicity declared major stem or non-stem and sat scores an evaluation of the effect that these characteristics had on student achievement due to differentiating import placed on the use of pogils as a learning tool was included this study used data obtained from a longitudinal examination of eight years of student data from an introductory forensic science survey course offered in a r1 northeastern universitythis study addressed the effectiveness of applying a proscribed active learning methodology one proposed effective in collegiate education to a new environment forensic science the methodology employed combined fourteen pogils created specifically for the chosen course with didactic lecture during the entire semester of a forensic science survey course this quasi-experimental design used the manipulation of the independent variable the use of a hybrid lecture instead of exclusive use of traditional didactic lectures on the students academic achievement on exams given during the courseparticipants in this study n1436 were undergraduate students enrolled in the single semester introductory science course a longitudinal study that incorporated eight years of data was completed 4 years pre-intervention 2007-2010 and 4 years post-intervention 2011-2014 the forensic science survey course taught by only one professor during the eight-year period was a science discipline that had yet to integrate an active learning educational modelfindings indicate four variables significantly contributed to explaining nearly 28 of the variation seen in the student class averages earned during the eight-year period the intervention gender stem majors and sat scores on average the intervention significantly altered exam scores f 1 1431  43019 p  0000 r2  0029 raising exam averages 31 within the population females outperformed their male counterparts by 19 although both genders were significantly affected by the intervention f 1 1431  13698 p  0000 r2  0009 students with declared majors in the stem fields outperformed the non-stem fields by 56 a strong factor in the model f 1 1431  91918 p  0000 r2  0060 with both stem and non-stem students being positively affected by the intervention the sat scores however showed the strongest effect f 1 1431  345026 p  0000 r2  0179 where an increase of 31 in the student class averages could be seen for every 100 points earned on the sats further discussions include implications and correlations to recent research and directions for future research
