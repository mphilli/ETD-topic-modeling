polymethylmethacrylate bone cement polymerization fronts nonisothermal polymerization poly methyl methacrylate pmma bone cements have been successfully used as a space-filler between the bony structure and the metal prosthesis through the last half century however the material does have several drawbacks the main one is that aseptic loosening is still the major reason for revision in clinical life the etiology of cement loosening remains unclear this is in part the result of limited understanding of what factors affect long-term performance of cement in vivo  in this study it is hypothesized that the structural and mechanical properties across the cement mantle are heterogeneously distributed due to the process of mma polymerization under in vivo non-isothermal conditions ie bone 37c [arrow right] prosthesis rt the goals of this study are to investigate the effects of complexities of the chemical thermal and diffusional-dependent polymerization interactions on the structural and mechanical properties and to develop empirical test techniques that allow one to monitor and predict the complexities of the in vivo non-isothermal polymerization of the pmma bone cementa new empirical polymerization model based on a new overall rate constant analysis technique was developed using isothermal differential scanning calorimetry iso-dsc to precisely predict the local polymerization behavior this complex polymerization behavior under non-isothermal conditions formed the spatio-temporal polymerization front that progressed from the warmest side to the coolest side during the polymerization front progression higher porosity at the coolest side and higher residual stresses at the warmest side were developed depending on the thermal gradient the heterogeneous micromechanical property distribution across the cement mantle correlates with the structural property distributions under the in vivo non-isothermal condition the structural and mechanical heterogeneities in the 20-35c case led to the higher crack formations under the compression testpolymerization fronts are a possible reason why aseptic failure of the pmma bone cements still remains at a high rate the non-isothermal condition leads to the asymmetric heterogeneities in the structural and mechanical properties across the cement mantle
