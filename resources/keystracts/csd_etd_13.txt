children consonant disordered phonology the purpose of this study was to perceptually and acoustically assess and compare consonant clusters such as spr str attempted by children with and without disordered phonology subjects were sixteen 4 12 to 5 year old children 8 girls and 8 boys in two groups of 8 each all subjects were monolingual english-speaking children with normal hearing and developmental histories and age-appropriate language skills eight exhibited normal phonological development np while eight had disordered phonology dp exhibiting many speech sound production errors in addition all of the dp subjects reduced consonant clusters quite consistentlyall subjects were given a consonant cluster production task consisting of 19 real words representing three common three-element clusters and all of the two element clusters and singletons that make up those clusters paired with the i vowel all productions were phonetically transcribed from audio-videotapes and were acoustically analyzed using the computerized speech lab csl acoustic measurements included s duration stop gap frication duration aspiration duration and voice onset time votfew significant differences were found between the stops produced by the dp subjects in their attempts at clusters vs the stops evident in the cluster productions of the np group significant differences between the groups did occur for the stop gap measure in str skr and tr clusters overall it did not appear that the dp children were attempting to retain acoustic features of the deleted elements of their attempted clusters similarly there was little statistical evidence of acoustic distinctions between singleton consonants produced by the dp group in place of clusters and those produced by the np group for correct singletonsthere was no clear evidence that any of the children in the dp group were systematically differentiating between intended singletons and the singletons they were using for clusters in spite of the fact that they could auditorily discriminate between clusters and singletons this seems to indicate that their errors were relatively stable and also seems to show a lack of productive phonological knowledge in addition each of the dp subjects reduced clusters in a unique way this suggests that speech-language pathologists need to consider individual patterns of cluster reduction when treating children with disordered phonologyfuture research should study larger numbers of children who exhibit the same pattern of cluster reduction in order to investigate the issue of group differences more thoroughly
