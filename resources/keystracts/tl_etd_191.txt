high school recent reform projects in science education emphasize the development of problem-solving skills through hands-on inquiry-based investigations in a real world context although several curricula that correspond to the goals and recommendations of the reform projects have been developed the extent to which students with various cognitive backgrounds will benefit from these curricula remains unexploredthis study had three purposes a the determination of the problem-solving strategies used by students enrolled in chemistry in the community chemcom classes b an examination of the changes in students' problem-solving strategy use over time and across units in a chemcom course and c an investigation of how collaborative processes influence the problem-solving strategies of students in a chemcom classroomthe subjects for this study were 12 students from three high schools selected from 139 students from four high schools in upstate new york i administered four instruments to the students in order to measure four cognitive variables mental capacity degree of field independence formal reasoning ability and meaningful learning orientation i used the students' scores on these instruments to determine the cognitive profiles of the students and i selected 12 students to examine with respect to their individual problem-solving strategies and interactions while solving problems in groupsthe four problem-solving strategies used by the students in this study were a strategy a which is characterized by deductive reasoning and the use of efficient and accurate procedures b strategy b which is characterized by the use of trial and error multiple procedures and inductive reasoning c strategy c which is characterized by a dependence on algorithms equations and other rote tools and d strategy d which is characterized by the use of analogies and pattern recognitionthe results indicate that students who had similar cognitive profiles often used similar problem-solving strategies when individually solving problems in addition students in three of the four cognitive groups exhibited considerable changes in the relative frequencies of their problem-solving strategy use over the course of three instructional units finally the actions of the students when solving problems in groups were examined with respect to their cognitive profiles
