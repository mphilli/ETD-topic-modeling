continuity plurisubharmonic envelopes jensen measures let d be a domain in [special characters omitted]  the plurisubharmonic envelope of a function [varphi] [is an element of] cd is the supremum of all plurisubharmonic functions which are not greater than [varphi] on d  a bounded domain d is called c-regular if the envelope of every function [varphi] [is an element of] cd is continuous on d and extends continuously to d  the purpose of this thesis is to give a complete characterization of c -regular domains in terms of jensen measures  we show using gauthier's fusion lemma that a domain is locally c -regular if and only if it is c -regular
