black holes gravitational waves gravity ligo numerical relativity post-newtonian in this dissertation we study the applicability of different waveform models ingravitational wave searches for comparable mass binary black holes we determinethe domain of applicability of the computationally inexpensive closed form modelsand the same for the semi-analytic models that have been calibrated to numericalrelativity simulations and are computationally more expensive we further explorethe option of using hybrid waveforms constructed by numerically stitching analyticand numerical waveforms as filters in gravitational wave detection searches beyondmatched-filtering there is extensive processing of the filter output before a detectioncandidate can be confirmed we utilize recent results from numerical relativity tostudy the ability of ligo searches to make detections using recolored detector datalastly we develop a waveform model using recent self-force results that capturesthe complete binary coalescence process the self-force formalism was developed inthe context of extreme mass-ratio binaries and we successfully extend it to modelintermediate mass-ratios
