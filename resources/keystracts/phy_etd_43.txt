upsilon meson eta mesons supersymmetry branching ratios we searched for   b   via hindered m1 transitions 3  s   [arrow right]   b   and 2  s   [arrow right]   b   using cleo-ii data no significant evidence for such transitions was found and we set upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios that contradict many phenomenological estimates for the rates of these transitions
