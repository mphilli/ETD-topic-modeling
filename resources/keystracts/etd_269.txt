bi-lipschitz map cantor set dimension fractal metric space quasisymmetric map we investigate a quasisymmetrically invariant counterpart of the topological hausdorff dimension of a metric space  this invariant called the topological conformal dimension gives a lower bound on the topological hausdorff dimension of quasisymmetric images of the space  we obtain results concerning the behavior of this quantity under products and unions and compute it for some classical fractals  the range of possible values of the topological conformal dimension is also considered and we show that this quantity can be fractional  the main theorem gives a lower bound on topological conformal dimension provided that the space contains a diffuse family of surfaces  this is parallel to a classical result of pansu that establishes a lower bound on conformal dimension given the existence of a diffuse family of curvesthis thesis also exposes a relationship between poincare inequalities and the topological hausdorff dimension  we give a lower bound on the dimension of ahlfors regular spaces satisfying a 1p-poincare inequality  finally an iterative construction involving cantor sets shows that there exist jordan arcs of arbitrary conformal dimensionthe methods used to obtain these results come from general topology geometric measure theory real analysis and analysis on metric spaces
