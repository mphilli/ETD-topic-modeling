neutron spin structure qcd sum we have determined the neutron spin structure function g\sbsp1n over the range 003 \le\ x\ \le 06 at an average q\sp2 of 2gevc\sp2 by measuring the asymmetry in deep inelastic scattering of polarized electrons from a polarized \sp3 he target the experiment was performed at slac and used energies between 19 and 26 gev the neutron asymmetry turned out to be small and negative and the integral of the neutron spin structure function is \int\sbsp01g\sbsp1nxdx  -0024 \pm\ 0006stat\pm\ 0008syst combined with the current available worldwide proton data this result confirmed the bjorken sum rule at 10 level once high-order perturbative qcd corrections are taken into account the ellis-jaffe sum rule for the neutron predicts \int\sbsp01g\sbsp1nxdx  -0010 \pm 0012 roughly consistent with our resultwe have also used our data to extract the integral over the quark spin distributions from the quark parton model the results yield \delta u  090 \pm 006 \delta d  -038\pm 004 and \delta s  -004\pm 006 hence the total quark contribution to the nucleon spin \delta u\delta d\delta s is 047 \pm 012 and the strange sea polarization is small
