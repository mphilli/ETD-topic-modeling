alkaline earth metal bone scaffold crystallization metal organic framework phosphonates x-ray crystallography the work presented herein describes synthetic methodologies leading to the design of a wide array of magnesium and calcium based phosphinate and phosphonates with possible applications as bone scaffolding materials or additives to bone cements the challenge to the chemistry of the alkaline earth phosphonate target compounds includes poor solubility of compounds and poorly understood details on the control of the metal's coordination environment hence less is known on phosphonate based alkaline earth metal organic frameworks as compared to transition metal phosphonates factors governing the challenges in obtaining crystalline well-defined magnesium and calcium solids lie in the large metal diameters the absence of energetically available d-orbitals to direct metal geometry as well as the overall weakness of the metal-ligand bondsa significant part of this project was concerned with the development of suitable reaction conditions to obtain x-ray quality crystals of the reaction products to allow for structural elucidation of the novel compounds various methodologies to aid in crystal growth including hydrothermal methods and gel crystallization were employedwe have used phosphinate and phosphonate ligands with different number of phosphorus oxygen atoms as well as diphosphonates with different linker lengths to determine their effects on the overall structural features an interesting correlation is observed between the dimensionality of products and the increasing number of donor oxygen atoms in the ligands as we progress from phosphinic acid to the phosphorous acids as an example monophosphinate ligand only yielded one-dimensional compounds whereas the phosphonates crystallize as one and two-dimensional compounds and the di- and triphosphonate based compounds display two or three-dimensional geometriesthis thesis provides a selection of calcium and magnesium compounds with one-dimensional geometry as represented in a calcium phosphinate to novel two-dimensional sheets of magnesium and pillared calcium phosphonates the preparation of these novel compounds has led to the establishment of synthetic protocols that allow for the direct preparation of compounds with defined structural features
