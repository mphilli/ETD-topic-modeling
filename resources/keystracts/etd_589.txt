affect deleuze embodiment kristeva participation in this dissertation i explore articulate and make the case for an affective embodied and non-representational theoretical approach to music in religious practices with an emphasis on participatory singing and dancing by drawing on the work of julia kristeva gilles deleuze thomas turino and others  using this theoretical approach i focus on two sites or cases of musical and kinetic practices in the contemporary united states mainline protestant hymn singing and contra dancing  i argue that this approach helps us to better understand how these practices function religiously for participants  these practices are of particular interest because of their participatory dimensions and the ways they articulate different relationships between bodies and music and between bodies and other bodies as compared with the more common presentational modes of engaging in music in mainstream consumer culture  in this respect they facilitate the actualization of counter-hegemonic potentials for religious life and human flourishing
