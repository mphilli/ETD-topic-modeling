father involvement maternal-child health the literature on father involvement in low-income racially diverse families has grown in recent years but is far from complete  continued research is needed to better understand those factors that support father involvement which has been identified to be a key contributor to maternal and child wellbeing  this dissertation examines the utility of using existing large-scale maternal-child health datasets to generate insights into the processes that contribute to father involvement  two large scale maternal-child health data sets on low-income families were examined to improve our understanding of the nature of father involvement at birth and in infancyearly childhood  multinomial logistic and logistic regression models were developed to examine predictors of father involvement at the time of birth and at 36 months after birth  significant predictors of low levels of father involvement included 1 a non-marital birthunmarried parents 2 mothers without a high school education 3 teen pregnancy 4 maternal poverty 5 race a proxy for other social risk factors for both black and white mothers compared to latino mothers but with black mothers having the greatest likelihood of low father involvement 6 maternal risky lifestylehealth behaviors and maternal prenatal health risks 7 maternal depressionantidepressant use and 8 unintended pregnancy  these findings expand the boundaries of both the child and family studies and maternal-child healthpublic health literature by validating theoretical frameworks that have been proposed for the study of father involvement and by identifying maternal characteristics and behaviors that increase the risk for low father involvement  this study identifies opportunities for earlier intervention focused on risk reduction and identifies additional areas for future research  the results of this study enhance the literature on low-income minority fathers--an area that has been identified as neglected and in need of significant attention
