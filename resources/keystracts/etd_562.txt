 this thesis addresses three primary questions based on the pharmacodynamics pd or pharmacokineticspk of the diabetes drug exendin 4 ex-4 and vitamin b12 b12 bioconjugates thereofq1 chapter 2 what effect does b12 conjugation to ex-4 have on agonism of the glucagon-like peptide-1receptor glp-1r in vitro and on pdpk including brain uptake and function in vivogoal to remove side-effects nausea weight loss of ex-4 without loss of glucoregulationq2 chapter 3 can b12 dietary uptake proteins such as gastric intrinsic factor offer protection to b12conjugated peptides or proteins focusing on ex-4 with a view to improving in vivo pkgoal to demonstrate in vivo that if binding of b12-ex-4 confers protection against gastricproteolysis as a road-map to oral peptide deliveryq3 chapter 4 can a dual agonist of the glp-1r and neuropeptide y2 receptor based on the ex-4 primaryamino acid sequence be designed and validated in vitro and in vivogoal to create a new therapeutic to simultaneously treat diabetes and obesity
