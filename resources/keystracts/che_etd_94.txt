immune deficiency hiv-1 psi rna dimerization nucleocapsid protein binding the monomer-dimer equilibrium of three rnas 19 27 and 41-mers containing the dimer initiation site dis from the hiv-1 -element are studied by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the equilibrium constants are reported to aid in interpreting experiments differential equations for diffusion migration and reaction were solved to simulate gel patterns showing that if only monomer and dimer peaks were present the equilibrium constant k could be calculated from the spot intensities if the pattern was more complicated having streaks a load-and-run gel was needed to give the value of k  since equilibrium was rapid in the gel well a dilution factor was used to estimate the sample concentration in the well to test our technique a study of dna 12-mers was done which yielded k s comparable to literature values the dimerization constants at 5c for the 19 27 and 41-mer rnas were 10 8  10 6  and 10 5 m -1 at an ionic strength of 100 mm the decrease in k with length is attributed partly to changes in rotational entropy of rigid rod type molecules and conformational entropy of the monomers the equilibrium between stem-loop 3 sl3 also from the hiv-1 -element and the nucleocapsid protein ncp7 was also studied by gel electrophoresis showing at least two different rna-protein complexes are formed the gel intensity data was fit to several models differing in species stoichiometries giving the best fit for a 21 complex rnancp7 ratio that self-associates to an 84 tetramer for the dilution experiments at 5c and ionic strength of 28 mm k 1 for the 21 complex is 10 11 m -2 and k 2 for the 84 complex is 10 16 m -3  the titration experiments gave k 1  10 7 m -2 poorly determined and k 2  10 19 m -3  considering the importance of rna dimerization and ncp7 binding to hiv proliferation in vivo these studies could lay the groundwork to new therapies
