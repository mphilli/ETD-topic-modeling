alcohol use african-americans condom use hivaids experimental vignettes depicting a hypothetical sexual encounter were used to test causal hypotheses generated from the theory of gender and power tgp on self-reported difficulty implementing condom use among heterosexual african american adults one hundred fifty five women and n 155 men completed a repeated measures experimental protocol of 8 experimental vignettes designed to manipulate the following aspects of a sexual encounter relationship power low vs equal partner type casual vs serious and presence or absence of alcohol use immediately prior to a sexual event for female participants significant main effects for the 3 manipulated independent variables emerged such that experimental vignettes characterized by low relationship power a serious partner type and presence of alcohol use received significantly higher mean ratings of difficulty implementing condom use for men only a robust main effect for alcohol use and a modest main effect for relationship power were observed condom use self-efficacy also emerged as an important between subjects variable such that male and female participants who reported low levels of self-efficacy found it significantly more difficult to implement condom use in all experimental conditions this project adds to the existing literature in three ways a extensive formative work was conducted to provide a template for and facilitate an increase in experimental hiv-related research b study hypotheses were explored using an experimental methodology which allowed for the investigation of the theory-based causal mechanisms underlying condom use behavior in a sample at high risk for hiv acquisition c the results from this study have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of hiv prevention interventions and contribute to the reduction of hiv infection among african american adults
