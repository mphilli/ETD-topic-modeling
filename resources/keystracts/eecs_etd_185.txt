electrical engineering addressed in this dissertation is the problem of detecting a target in clutter and noise with unknown statistics in the space-time polarization and polarization-space-time domainsfirst we analyze a practical problem of selecting localized processing regions lpr for joint space-time localized processing considering the angle-doppler coupling effects of the clutter spectrum the effects of lpr size position shape and window on the detection performance of the joint domain localized generalized likelihood ratio jdl-glr processor are analyzed in detailthree processors in the polarization domain ie the adaptive clutter polarization canceller-based detector apc polarization discontinuity detector pdd and kelly's glr detector are compared to see which of the three has a relatively good detection performance while still relatively easy to implementthe problem of combining adaptive polarization processing and space-time processing is also studied for further performance improvement of radar target detection in clutter and jammer environments the development focuses on the joint polarization-space-time domain since most straightforward cascade combinations have quite limited performance improvement potentials the processing algorithm developed does not need a potentially costly polarization filter bank to cover the unknown target polarization parameter the analytical detection performance is derived and evaluated in terms of the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm and it is compared with other algorithms that do not utilize the polarization information or that assume the target polarization is knownfinally two polarization-space-time processors are compared in a nonhomogeneous and nonstationary clutter environment along with performance potential comparison of the processors of different configurations to solve the limited secondary data problem we shall apply the localized processing technique to the polarization-space-time processors and compare their detection performance
