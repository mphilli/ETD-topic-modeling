compressible flow gortler vortices boundary layers curved ramps this is the first experimental investigation in compressible flow in which grtler vortices were parametrically identified and characterized grtler vortices are counter-rotating pairs of longitudinal vortices that occur as a result of centrifugal instabilities in the boundary layer in flows over curved surfaces with concave curvature curved ramp models with a radius of curvature of 254 cm or 508 cm were mounted in a supersonic blow-down air tunnel with a rem of 418-596  10 7   mach number was varied from approximately 15 to 30 surface roughness effects were examined by applying small vortex generators at 1 mm or 157 mm spacing to the leading edge of the models micro-carbon particulate surface flow visualization was combined with a novel threshold analysis technique to identify existence and wavelength of grtler vorticesthe results confirm that grtler vortices do exist in compressible flow and occur in the regime of flow parameters predicted by compressible stability analyses a trend of increasing stability with decreasing mach number does not match the predicted trend but when vortex generators are added to the model the trend is slightly closer to the predicted trend it was also found that the dimensional grtler vortex wavelength does not vary with mach number re number or radius of curvature this invariance of grtler vortex wavelength agrees with experimental results from incompressible flow
