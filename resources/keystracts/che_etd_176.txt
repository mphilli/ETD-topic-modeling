lanthanides fluoroalkoxides examination of the new fluorinated perfluoro- t  -butoxide and aryloxide 2-phenylphenolate species delineates several  factors responsible for their structure and function key elements in  the coordination aggregation behavior and reactivity of these systems  have been linked to secondary interactions including m-c m-n m-f  and m-hagostic interactions further investigations into these often  ignored interactions may provide value information into the  structure-function relationships that could provide an increased  understanding of the reactivity of s-block and lanthanide complexesthis  dissertation is an attempt to investigate some of the significant  secondary interactions [m-f m-c and m-hagostic] gain insight into  methods to quantify them and determine the structure-functions  relationships of the secondary interactions insights were provided by  investigating bond-valence sums as a method to quantify the contribution  toward steric saturation from secondary interactions the role of the  fluoromethyl group of the perfluoro-  t  -butoxide pftb ligand  as a donor archetype for the m-f interaction and 2-phenylphenolate  ompp ligand as the prototype to further investigate the significance  of m-c interactions
