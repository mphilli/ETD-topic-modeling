carbohydrates wittig rearrangement natural products nonlinear optical a library of [alpha]-alkoxy allylstannyl ether substrates was synthesized to examine the stereochemical outcome of the unstabilized [alpha]-alkoxy allylstannyl ether [23] wittig rearrangement well-defined stereoselectivities transpired for the generation of di- and tri-substituted olefins via the [23] wittig rearrangement lithiation of [alpha]-alkoxy allylstannyl ethers and subsequent rearrangement produced a mixture of e and z olefins and the reliability of the unstabilized [23] wittig rearrangement was determinedupon completion of the unstabilized [23] wittig methodology study our next project consisted of utilizing carbohydrates as chiral templates toward the asymmetric synthesis of natural products our ultimate goal was to use this approach to install a z disubstituted alkene in the target moleculethe partial synthesis of --discodermolide and dictyostatin a potent immunosuppressive agent against lymphoma and breast carcinoma cells and a cytotoxic agent towards 60 different human cancer cell lines respectively began with a common carbohydrate precursor methyl-[alpha]-d-glucopyranosidethe preparation of a novel nonlinear optical substrate via molecular engineering of organic materials features a highly conjugated five-membered ring linker fragment it was postulated that the molecular rigidity of this molecule thereby conformationally locks it into a planar structure thus increasing the [pi]-stacking abilities and nlo properties
