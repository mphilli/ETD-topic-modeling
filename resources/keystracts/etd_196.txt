econometrics energy economics extreme value theory nonparametric estimation spatial econometrics chapter 1this essay examines the effect of state renewable energy policies in inducing innovation and the spillover effect of these policies on innovation in neighboring states the analysis is conducted with patent data related to renewable technology using wind power for the united states over the period 1983-2010 we run a panel data regression of a log transformation of states' yearly patent counts on state renewable energy policies and spatially weighted average of renewable energy policies in neighboring states using the tobit model with individual effects the results show that renewable energy rules regulation and mandates such as interconnection standards net metering and renewable portfolio standard enacted in neighboring states have shown a statistically significant positive spillover effect in increasing the number of patent applications in that state however financial policies such as tax incentives and subsidy policies implemented by neighboring states have shown statistically significant negative effects on technological innovation within that statechapter 2in this essay we have conducted a monte carlo study of the prediction performance of various nonparametric estimation methods for spatially dependent data such as the nonparametric local linear kernel estimator the nadraya-watson estimator and the k-nearest neighbors method developed by hallin et al 2004b lu and chen 2002 pm robinson 2011 and li and tran 2009 with data sampled on a rectangular grid in a nonlinear random field the results show that nonparametric local linear kernel method has the best performance in terms of mean squared prediction error the nadaraya-watson estimation method also performs well in general these two nonparametric methods consistently outperform the k-nearest neighbors method and the maximum likelihood method regardless of the data generating process and sample size however the maximum likelihood method does not perform well because the spatial weight matrix can only be used to estimate linear structures while the true data generating process is nonlinear this also gives some support to the idea of using nonparametric methods when various misspecification may exist either in the functional form or spatial weight matrix for spatially dependent datawe use these methods to predict county-level crop yields with spatially weighted precipitation the results are generally consistent with the simulation results the nonparametric local linear kernel estimator has the best prediction performance the nadaraya-watson estimator also performs better than the k-nearest neighbors method and the maximum likelihood estimator however with an inverse distance weighting matrix the maximum likelihood estimator outperforms the k-nearest neighbors method in predicting crop yieldchapter 3this essay uses the exceedances over high threshold model of davidson and smith 1990  to investigate the univariate tail distribution of the returns on various energy products such as crude oil gasoline heating oil propane and diesel the bivariate threshold exceedance model of ledford and tawn 1996 is also used to study the tail dependence between returns on various pairs of selected energy products tail index estimates for univariate threshold exceedance models show that these returns generally have fat tails similar to those of a student's t-distribution with 2 to 5 degrees of freedom except that for crude oil where the tail index estimates  are closer to that of a normal distribution we also estimate the tail dependence index for four pairs of energy products crude oilgasoline crude oilheating oil crude oilpropane crude oildiese the correlation coefficients implied by the dependence index estimates show that correlations conditional on threshold exceedance are generally higher than the unconditional correlation between crude oilheating oil and crude oilgasoline however there is some variation in the implied correlation between crude oilpropane and crude oildiesel whether the extreme correlation will be higher or lower than the unconditional correlation depends on the threshold chosen
