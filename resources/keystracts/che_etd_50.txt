triflates ruthenium olefins strategies such as olefin metathesis were investigated to make stable mixed-valence compounds and materials incorporating metal atoms in polyolefin chains which are potential precursors in molecular electronicsnew olefin metathesis catalysts having the general molecular formula h 2 imesruchrcl 2 3-bromopyridine 2 and h 2 imesruchrcl 2 pcy 3  where r  me et and pr were prepared their kinetic reactivity towards olefins was studied the pcy 3 catalysts initiated faster 6-14 times than the grubbs catalyst where r  ph the 3-bromopyridine catalysts were similar in reactivity to the grubbs catalyst where r  phpolyacetylene was prepared in powder and film forms from acetylene using ruthenium olefin metathesis a new material metathesis-doped polyacetylene mdpa with ruthenium incorporation in the polyacetylene which was soluble in common organic solvents was prepared the 3-bromopyridine catalyst where r  ph effected the polymerization of 1-hexyne and propargyl alcoholtwo new ring-constrained polyenes 15-dimethylene-12345678-octahydronapthalene and 15-dimethylene-decahydronapthalene and two polyynes 14-pentadiyne and 3366-tetramethyl-147-octatriyne were investigated as precursors for ring-constrained diruthenium complexes through sequential ene-yne ring-closing and stoichiometric olefin metathesis reactions all compounds failed to give the desired complexes under a variety of conditionsa new class of ruthenium alkylidene complexes of trimethylphosphine h 2 imesruchrcl 2 pme 3  where r  ph and et were prepared they were metathesis-unreactive at room temperature thus a method of stopping the metathesis reactivity was found by the simple addition of pme 3  a new ruthenium alkylidene namely pcy 3 ruchc 6 h 5 cl 2 3-bromopyridine 2  was prepared a new set of fischer carbenes was prepared including a tristrimethylphosphine complex with molecular formula pme 3  3 ruchoch 2 ch 3 cl 2 two dienyl ditriflates 234678-hexahydronapthalene-15-ditriflate and 344a788a-hexahydronapthalene-15-ditriflate were prepared the former in higher yield and greater reproducibility than done before their reactivity and potential application as ring-constrained precursors to prepare diruthenium complexes were investigated
