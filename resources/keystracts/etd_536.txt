information model product disassembly sustainable manufacturing disassembly a process of separating the end of life eol product into discrete components for re-utilizing their associated residual values is an important part for the sustainable manufacturing this work focuses on the modeling of the disassembly planning related information and develops a disassembly information model dim based on an extensive investigation of various informational aspects of the disassembly planning the developed disassembly information model which represents an appropriate systematization and classification of the products processes uncertainties and degradations related information follows a layered modeling methodology in this layered configuration the dim is subdivided into three distinct layers with an intent to separate general knowledge into different levels of abstractions and to reach a balance between information reusability and information usability the performance evaluation of the dim usability and reusability is accessed by successful implementations of the dim model into two prototype software applications in the domain of disassembly planningthe first application called the disassembly sequence generator dsg identifies the optimal disassembly sequence using a cad based searching algorithm and a disassembly linear programming lp model the searching process results in an andor graph which represents all the feasible disassembly sequences of a specific eol product whereas the lp model takes the andor graph as an input and determines the economically optimal process sequence among all the possibilitiesthe second application is called the adaptive disassembly planning adp which further takes the eol product uncertainty and degradation issues into consideration in order to address these issues fuzzy logic and bayesian network methodologies are used to develop a disassembly decision network ddn which adaptively generates the optimal disassembly sequence based on the current available informationthis research work is the first attempt to develop a comprehensive information model in the domain of disassembly planning the associated modeling methodology that has been developed in this research is generic and scalable and it could be widely adopted in other engineering domains like product assembly production planning etc the ultimate objective of this work is to standardize the dim into a reference model that will be acknowledged and agreed upon by the sustainable manufacturing community
