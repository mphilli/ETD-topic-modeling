the absurd jean-paul sartre albert camus ionesco beckett cuba the narrative of virgilio pinera collects the thought and aesthetic influence comprised in the literature of the absurd which is specially present in drama here we will examine ideological and aesthetic sources from sartre and albert camus to the group of dramatists of the absurd which includes ionesco beckett and adamov as well as the significant contribution of kafkian absurd in contemporary narrativethese influences are a part of pinera's absurdist vision where the absurd always results from the presence of irrationality in natural everyday order each event announced as perfectly logical one is always reduced to its possible denial to its definite meeting with the absurd hence the absurd is not simply a formal procedure such as the lack of coherence in language practiced in theatre but more likely a definition of the universe and its relationship with humanityvirgilio pinera like sabato cortazar and other latin american writers finds in absurdist or existencialist aesthetics the precise mechanism for denouncing the lack of rationality of a world full of both wealth and misery of both great spirituality and a lack of morality pinera's short stories and novels make up a homogenous view of a world marked by despair as a result of a fragile human condition and limited by its somatic elements which prevent it from fully understanding its existencethe main conclusion is that for pinera absurdist aesthetics are the most effective instrument for expressing cuba's historical social and political reality which also transcends the particular problem in order to project a reality of a more universal scope
