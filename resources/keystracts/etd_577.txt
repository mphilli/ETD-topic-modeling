alkaline earth bismuth coordination chemistry lanthanides main-group secondary interactions the first part of this work discusses a series of experiments involving trans-azobenzene phnnph a redox active ligand in conjunction with the alkaline earth metals calcium strontium barium and the rare earth metal europium a series of complexes were prepared and characterized the neutral co-ligands tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane are introduced as both solvents and lewis basic donors ligand size effects are examined with the introduction of the bulkier azobenzene derivatives mesnnph and mesnnmes mes  246-me3c6h2 the fine structure details obtained by single crystal x-ray diffraction allowed for the systematic study of primary ligand coordination modes the quantity and mode of co-ligand coordination and finally the nature and extent of secondary interactions with respect to trends in metal size we are able to closely examine the factors present that impart additional stabilization to these highly reactive speciesin the latter part of this thesis with a focus on mocvd applications the perfluoro-t-butoxide pftb ligand is used to prepare a set of novel bismuth alkoxides these complexes were compared to other bismuth alkoxides and early lanthanide alkoxides in both their structural and thermal properties using an adaptation of a previously published pathway a number of novel bismuth compounds have been synthesized this synthetic route has since been shown to be fruitful herein and results have been obtained with a related ligand system by a colleague the pathway may prove a more general route to produce bismuth containing targets
