spillovers banking business community finance this dissertation extends and applies real option theory to the external financing of corporate rd projects a real option model is developed which shows the interaction between rd investment and financing decisions the model is used to formulate a decision role for financing rd projects this is used in a clinical setting to evaluate sword securities stock warrant off-balance sheet financing of rd issued by the biotechnology firm centocorhigh-technology rd projects are often both capital intensive and long term and a heavy financial burden to firms companies have traditionally financed rd projects internally presumably to avoid the disclosure of proprietary information which may result in spillover costs if it falls into the hands of competitors many high-technology firms however do not have enough financial slack to internally finance every good rd project and are forced to externally finance or abandon themreal options are a recent development in capital budgeting theory which are used to evaluate the option-like features found within many types of real investment projects these embedded real options are the result of some flexibility or growth opportunity which may be exercised by management over time as new information arrives to resolve some uncertainty real options cannot be measured using traditional discounted cash flow dcf techniques like net present value npvrd projects are particularly well suited to real option modeling because they contain a high degree of uncertainty exist over long periods of time have an output which itself is another option either an option on a new business venture or an option on the next stage of rd and proceed in stages where learning takes place over time to reduce some uncertainty a continuous time real option model of rd is developed showing the assumptions and limitations of the option pricing model critical issues to be resolved before applying a real option model to rd include the spanning assumption the existence of a dividend-like convenience yield and a non-constant variancerd projects are modeled as combinations of flexibility and growth options in amounts which depend on the particular project flexibility options include the ability to defer or to abandon an rd project growth options have two components the expected growth option which is an option on a new business venture and unexpected growth options resulting from new discoveries a real options perspective of rd gives new insights about the interaction between investment and financing decisionsmultiple real and financial options interact which causes the interaction between investment and financing decisions for rd projects it is shown that flexibility and growth options are independent of each other making them value-additive investment and financing flexibility are substitutes making them non-value-additive and spillover costs are the result of disclosing growth options not flexibility options this is combined into a financing decision rule for rd projects based on real option content this is used to analyze sword securities issued by the firm centocor
