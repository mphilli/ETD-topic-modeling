membrane gas separations the objective of the present research was to study the effects of different membrane processes configurations and recycle schemes on the performance and economics of membrane and hybrid membraneabsorption processes for the separation of gas mixtures the following applications were considered a the production of oxygen-enriched air and b the removal of acid gases co\sb2 and h\sb2s from natural gasthe operating conditions for six different membrane process configurations were optimized to determine the lowest cost for the production of oxygen-enriched air containing a minimum of 30 mole- o\sb2 it was confirmed that a single permeation stage without product recycle and with vacuum pumping of the permeate is the optimum process configuration membrane processes for the oxygen-enrichment of air were found to have the best potential of becoming economically competitive for small plant capacities  about 20 tpd of epo\sb2 and at oxygen concentrations in the range of 30-45 mole- the properties of polymer membranes required to develop an economically-competitive membrane process for the oxygen-enrichment of air were also identifiedthe operating conditions of seven different membrane process configurations for the removal of acid gases from natural gas were optimized on the basis of new more meaningful process variables a three-stage configuration consisting of a single permeation stage in series with a two-stage cascade resulted in the lowest separation cost at the base case operating conditions membrane processes for the removal of co\sb2 were found to be more economical than dea absorption and hybrid membraneabsorption processes for the removal of both co\sb2 and h\sb2s however membrane and hybrid processes result in the lowest separation cost over certain ranges of acid gas concentrations these concentration ranges were found to be sensitive to variations in operating and economic parameters and in membrane properties
