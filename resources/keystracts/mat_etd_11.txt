reproducing kernels sample entropy k-d trees rkhs support vector machines randomized k-d trees biological time series classification entropy in this thesis we study classification of biological time series and its related theoretical issues we focus on two issues fast algorithms for computing the sample entropy of a time series which describes the complexity of the time series and reproducing kernels used in the support vector machine for classification to compute the sample entropy of a time series we introduce a randomized k-d tree and a fast algorithm based on the randomized k-d tree to compute the sample entropy we systematically analyze the randomized k-d tree and estimate the time complexity of the fast algorithm for reproducing kernels we conduct foundational research such as giving reproducing kernels of some commonly used function spaces like harmonic function spaces and sobolev spaces creating reproducing kernels from integral operators and clarifying the inner product of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces associated with reproducing kernels
