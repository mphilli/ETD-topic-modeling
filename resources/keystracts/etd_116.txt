electromagnetics laguerre transform marching-on-in-degree method of moment numerical method parallel computing the time domain method of moment has been proposed for a long time the marching-on-in-time solver suffers from late time instability while the marching-on-in-degree technique can avoid this problemthis thesis introduces a new temporal basis function and a new green's function form that improves the computation speed of the marching-on-in-degree technique this method can be used for the perfect conductor and can also be applied to conductors with loss or dielectricas a method of moment solver this marching-on-in-degree technique must solve a dense matrix equation and it may be time consuming if the objects are very large therefore parallelization and a hybrid method are also proposed to handle large objectsthis thesis will cover all my improvements to the time domain marching-on-in-degree method
