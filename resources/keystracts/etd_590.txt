byzantine attack eavesdropping inference networks jamming security parallel-topology inference networks consist of spatially-distributed sensing agents that collect and transmit observations to a central node called the fusion center fc so that a global inference is made regarding the phenomenon-of-interest poi in this dissertation we address two types of statistical inference namely binary-hypothesis testing and scalar parameter estimation in parallel-topology inference networks we address three different types of security threats in parallel-topology inference networks namely eavesdropping data-confidentiality byzantine data-integrity or jamming data-availability attacks in an attempt to alleviate information leakage to the eavesdropper we present optimalnear-optimal binary quantizers under two different frameworks namely differential secrecy where the difference in performances between the fc and eve is maximized and constrained secrecy where fcs performance is maximized in the presence of tolerable secrecy constraints we also propose near-optimal transmit diversity mechanisms at the sensing agents in detection networks in the presence of tolerable secrecy constraints in the context of distributed inference networks with m-ary quantized sensing data we propose a novel byzantine attack model and find optimal attack strategies that minimize kl divergence at the fc in the presence of both ideal and non-ideal channels furthermore we also propose a novel deviation-based reputation scheme to detect byzantine nodes in a distributed inference network finally we investigate optimal jamming attacks in detection networks where the jammer distributes its power across the sensing and the communication channels we also model the interaction between the jammer and a centralized detection network as a complete information zero-sum game we find closed-form expressions for pure-strategy nash equilibria and show that both the players converge to these equilibria in a repeated game finally we show that the jammer finds no incentive to employ pure-strategy equilibria and causes greater impact on the network performance by employing mixed strategies
