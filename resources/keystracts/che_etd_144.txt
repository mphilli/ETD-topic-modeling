transannular coupling pentamethylcyclopentadienyliron unsaturated hydrocarbon bridges iodine and bromine were discovered to be readily added to 16-cyclodecadiyne to regioselectively form transannular coupling products 15-diiodo-234678-hexahydronaphthalene and the dibromo derivative respectively solvent-incorporation products were observed in the addition of iodine when the reaction was done in benzene chlorobenzene or methanol silver nitrate-assisted iodination of the cyclodiyne in methanol gave 1-iodo-5-methoxy-234678-hexahydronaphthlene as a major product acid-catalyzed transannular hydration of the diyne led to a facile formation of 345678-hexahydronaphthalene-12h-one a cyclic iodonium ion and a vinyl cation were proposed as intermediates in the iodination reaction pathway based on the controlled mechanistic studies the diyne is also very reactive to 16-electron cationic iron complexes white the diene diiodide can oxidatively add to tetrakistriphenylpalladiun complexpentamethylcyclopentadienyl dicarbonyl iron anion fp\spk reacted with cis-34-dichlorocyclobutene producing ring-closed compounds trans-3-chloro-4- cp\spco\sb2fe -cyclobutene and cp\spco\sb2fe \sb2-\mu-trans-34-cyclobutenediyl and ring-opened compounds cp\spco\sb2fe -chch-chccl and cp\spco\sb2fe \sb2-\mu-chch-chch each isolated independently under different conditions the closed-ring complexes underwent electrocyclic ring opening reactions to form the ring-opened complexes in quantitative yields photochemical reactions of cp\spco\sb2fe \sb2-\mu-chch-chch with \eta\sp2-bisdiphenylphosphinoethane produced the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl butadiene-bridged diiron complex cp\sp\eta\sp2-dppefe \sb2-\mu-chch-chch which was characterized in its three oxidation state neutral cation and dication the x-ray structure of the neutral form was also determinedthe cyclic voltammogram of cp\sp\eta\sp2-dppefe \sb2-\mu-chch-chch showed two single-electron reversible oxidation waves separated by 060 v a large comproportionation constant 142\times10\sp10 was determined for the formation of radical cation complex \cp\sp\eta-dppefe\\sb2-\mu -chch-chch pf\sb6 mossbauer spectra characterize the radical cation and dication complex \cp\sp\eta\sp2-dppefe\\sb2- \mu-chch-chch pf\sb6\rbrack\sb2 as isovalent complexes electronic spectra of the radical cation showed a narrow band at 505 nm from metal-ligand charge transfer and a strong broad solvent-independent band at 1427 nm assigned as an intervalence transition characteristic of mixed-valence complexes the radical cation is classified as a nontrapped delocalized robin-day class iii mixed-valence complex with an effective coupling parameter v\rm\sbab  043 evinstead of forming the expected \mu-\rm c\sb2h\sb2 olefin-bridged heterodinuclear complexes reactions of iron acetylide cp\spdppefe-c\equivch with hydrozirconium chloride diisobutyl-aluminum hydride and catecholborane led to the formation of c\sb2-bridged complexes cp\spdppefe-c\equivc-zrclcp\sb2 cp\spdppefe-c\equivcal\rm\spibu\sb2 and cp\spdppefe-c\equivc-bcat respectively in high yields with the release of hydrogen gas as a by-product a two-electron three-center mechanism is proposed for these reactions reaction of the iron acetylide with dimethylaminotrimethyltin gave the condensed product cp\spdppefe-c\equivc-snme\sb3 in quantitative yield
