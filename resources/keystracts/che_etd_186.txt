biochemistry molecular biology chemistry injections of hpyy3-36 have shown positive effects on appetite regulation with nearly 400 million adults worldwide considered obese these positive effects have sparked an increased interest in hpyy3-36 research including release profiles receptor targets and medicinal applications a major area of interest is oral delivery of hpyy3-36 that can display clinically relevant weight-loss outcomes in what would be a highly patient compliant route the vitamin b12 b12 pathway has already been successfully used for oral delivery of other peptides including erythropoietin and insulin but the quantity delivered has been below clinically relevant levels herein we present synthesis purification characterization and clinically relevant in vivo oral delivery of b12-hpyy3-36 conjugatesthe hpyy3-36 sequence was modified at the n terminus with an octahistidine tag and factor xa protease sequence along with the small ubiquitin-like modifier sumo tag and expressed in escherichia coli the fusion protein was purified with a yield of 30  7 mgl the sumo-tagged hpyy3-36 was digested with two different proteases to return either his-tagged hpyy3-36 or unmodified hpyy3-36 that were subsequently purified and characterized
