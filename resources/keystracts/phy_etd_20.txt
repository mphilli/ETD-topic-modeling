hydrogen helium parity violation strange form factors polarized electron scattering the happex ii measurement of the parity violating asymmetry  a pv   for longitudinally polarized 3 gev electrons from both hydrogen and 4  he cryogenic targets at a small scattering angle 6 is reported in this thesis the asymmetry for hydrogen is a function of a linear combination of [special characters omitted] and [special characters omitted]  the strange quark contributions to the electric and magnetic form factors of the nucleon respectively and that for 4  he is a function solely of [special characters omitted]  the combination of the two measurements therefore allows [special characters omitted] and [special characters omitted] to be separately determined the 4  he result is [special characters omitted]  640  023  stat    012   syst   ppm the hydrogen result is [special characters omitted]  -158  012  stat    004  syst   ppm the strange quark form factors extracted from these asymmetries are [special characters omitted]  0002  0014  0007 at  q   2   0077 gev  2   and [special characters omitted]  009[special characters omitted]  0007  0011  0006 at  q   2   0109 gev  2   these results significantly improve constraints on the electric and magnetic strange form factors with an unprecedented precision
