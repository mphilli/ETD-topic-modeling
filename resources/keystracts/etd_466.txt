greenhouse climate ica itoc oae 2 petm redox anthropogenic global warming affects marine ecosystems in complex ways and declining ocean oxygenation is a growing concern forecasting the geographical and bathymetric extent rate and intensity of future deoxygenation and its ecological effects however remains highly challenging because of the complex feedbacks in the climate-ocean-biota system global warming lowers the solubility of oxygen in the ocean and drives an enhanced hydrological cycle with increased nutrient delivery to the oceans leading to increases in organic production the degradation of which causes a further decrease in dissolved oxygen in extreme cases in the geological past this trajectory has led to strong marine oxygen depletion during the so-called oceanic anoxic events oaes how the water column oscillated between generally oxic conditions and localglobal anoxia remains a challenging question exacerbated by a lack of sensitive redox proxies especially at the interface between oxic and anoxic conditions to address this problem i use ica in bulk carbonate and itoc in black shale to reconstruct redox changes in the upper and deep waters in multiple ocean basins through the cretaceous oae 2 at the cenomanian-turonian boundary 94 ma the iodine proxy records are interpreted in the context of a wide range of other geochemical data and earth system biogeochemical model simulationsiodate and iodide are the most thermodynamically stable iodine ions in seawater the speciation of iodine depends on the redox condition of the ambient seawater iodate is abundant in oxic water and iodide dominates in anoxic water iodate is the only iodine ion that can precipitate with carbonate and carbonate associated iodine increases with iodate concentration in the matrix solution therefore ica values in carbonate can be used as a redox proxy of seawaterin general ica ratios were relatively low preceding and during the oae interval indicating deep suboxic or anoxic waters exchanging directly with near-surface waters however individual sites display a wide range of initial values and variability in ica through the oae interval reflecting the importance of local controls and potentially suggesting a high spatial variability in redox state both ica and cgenie model suggest that the northeast proto-atlantic had notably higher oxygen levels in the upper water column than the rest of the north atlantic highlighting important regional differences in redox conditions during oae 2 a lack of correlation with calcium lithium and carbon isotope records suggests that neither enhanced global weathering nor carbon burial was a dominant control on the ica proxy during oae 2itoc and iorg records were generated from six sections in proto-north atlantic and southern indian ocean itoc in modern surface and subsurface sediment decreases with decreasing bottom-water oxygen a feature potentially useful for reconstructing seafloor paleo-redox itoc decreases into oae 2 suggesting more reducing bottom-water conditions higher itoc values more oxic conditions are recorded in two high-latitude and possibly in one low-latitude site where higher oxygen levels are also indicated by other redox indicators and earth system modeling by cgenie itoc and ica records at a near-equatorial coastal site in morocco tarfaya decreased during oae 2 likely suggesting reducing water throughout the water column due to strong vertical mixing and shallow paleo-depth consistent with a wide range of other proxies these observations indicate that coeval carbonate and shale iodine records may be able to depict oxygenation changes in different parts of the water column and reflect the change in marine iodine reservoiranother rapid global warming event the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum petm 555 ma may represent a better analog for present and future global warming i apply the iodine to calcium ratio ica in bulk coarse fraction sediment and planktonic foraminiferal tests from pelagic sites in different oceans and compared the reconstruction with modeled oxygen levels the reconstructed iodate gradients indicate that deoxygenation occurred in the upper water column in the atlantic indian oceans and possibly the pacific ocean as well during the petm due to vertical and potentially lateral expansion of omzsoverall this thesis further establishes the use of iodine as a proxy for ocean oxygen levels in the geological history
