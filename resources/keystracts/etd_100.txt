b decays cp violation flavor physics lhc lhcb particle physics the analysis of the 3 fb^-1 data set collected by the lhcb experiment in 2011 and 2012 located at the lhc cern geneva switzerland is presentedthe data set is comprised of one third taken at center of mass energy sqrts  7 tev and the remaining two thirds taken at sqrts  8 tevthe data is analyzed for the decays b-  d0 k-  - and b-  d0 -  -with the d0  k- kk- - or  k-the cp violation sensitive observables r_cp a_cp and r_ds^ are measured whichare sensitive to the ckm angle gammaupper limits are reported for the values of r_s^ since the doubly cabibbo suppressed decay b-  d0 k-  - with d0  k- is not observed
