caging effect conserved directed percolation force network fractional quantum mechanics spin glass stochastic process this thesis documents a quest to develop and study several novel  interacting stochastic processes as for the first example we generalize a  system of vicious random walkers in which the only interaction between any two  random walkers is that when they intersect both walkers are annihilated we  define a system of n vicious accelerating walkers with each walker undergoing  random acceleration and compute the survival probability distribution for this  system we also define and study a system of n vicious levy flights  in which any two levy flights crossing one another annihilate each  other the average mean-squared displacement of a levy flight is not  proportional to time but scales with what is known as the levy index  divided by two in both cases vicious accelerating walkers and vicious levy flights we are motivated by ultimately generalizing our  understanding of gaussian random matrices via non-markovian and non-gaussian  extensions respectively moreover inspired by recent experiments on  periodically sheared colloids at low densities we define and investigate  several new contact processes or interacting stochastic processes with  conserved particle number and three-or-more-body interactions we do so to  characterize the periodically sheared colloidal system at higher densities we  find two new dynamical phase transitions between an active phase where some  fraction of the colloids are always being displaced from their position at the  beginning and end of each shear cycle and an inactive phase in which all  colloids return to their initial positions at the end of each shear cycle one  of the transitions is discontinuous while the second which is due to a caging  or crowding effect at high densities appears to be continuous and in a new  universality from what is known as conserved directed percolation the latter  transition may have implications for the onset of glassiness in dense  particulate systems in addition this thesis also includes analysis of the heterogeneous force network present in amorphous  solids near the onset of rigidity or jamming the onset of rigidity can in  some sense be viewed an interacting stochastic process with added constraints  to enforce force-balance on each particle for example our analysis yields  string-like correlations in the locally-large forces in the system such  correlations are reminiscent of force chains while force chains have been  readily observed in experiments it is the first time these correlations have  been observed in conjugate gradient simulations of repulsive soft spheres we  also study the contact geometry of the force network and explore a link with  spin systems namely spin glasses to search for signatures of chaos due to marginal stability for  instance connections between jamming systems and spin glass systems will  hopefully open up new avenues of theoretical investigation for both systems  finally we explore the quantum version of an individual stochastic process  namely the fractional schrodinger equation we prove that previously claimed  exact solutions for certain potentials are incorrect and determine a new exact  solution for a levy index of unity and the harmonic oscillator  potential while our results contribute to the realm of mathematical physics a  physical realization of the fractional schrodinger equation will indeed launch a  new subfield of quantum mechanics
