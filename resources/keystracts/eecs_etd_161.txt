parallel computing world wide web internet java dataflow integration as an important component in parallel software engineering software integration plays an indispensable role in building large-scale multi-disciplinary parallel and distributed applications on high-performance computing systems in this study we propose a software integration framework that is based on a dataflow programming paradigm and execution model for general-purpose hpdc applications advantages of this dataflow-based model are investigated and demonstrated we study applications of this model in several specific yet typical areas that have general needs for parallel software integration and are well suited to this dataflow model drawing from extensive software and system integration case studies in those areas we present the general requirements for a software integration framework in an hpdc application these areas include 1 integration of multiple parallel programming paradigms in a single unified environment 2 integration of interactive data visualization and parallel computations on a hetergeneous distributed environment 3 integration of networking navigation and parallel relational database management system rdbms and 4 integration of world wide web computing and information processing by viewing different parallel programming paradigms as an essentially heterogeneous approach in mapping real-world problems to parallel systems we discuss methodologies in integrating multiple programming models on a massively parallel system three applications in earth science financial modeling and computational electromagnetics are studied to demonstrate the integration of data-parallel and message-passing modules in the proposed multi-paradigm programming environment we develop interactive visualization systems on heterogeneous parallel and distributed computers using the dataflow model of an avs testbed in two case studies in financial modeling and computational electromagnetics applications we demonstrate a modular approach to couple parallel simulation modules into an interactive remote visualization environment viewing the client-server model as an essentially surface provides description only full text is available to proquest subscribers ask your librarian for assistance dataflow model we describe the concept of integrating distributed computing in a world wide web www environment for data-intensive internet applications we examine approaches in integrating parallel relational databases and a web-based networking navigation interface realization of the proposed dataflow integration model in java and www is also described
