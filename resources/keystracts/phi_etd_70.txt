pessimism i aim to revive pessimism as a topic of philosophical discussion toward that end i defend a theory of pessimism designed to locate pessimism within the existing philosophical literature and to account for the epistemic and prudential conditions under which pessimism is warranted i argue for three main theses 1 pessimism is a stance in which one takes oneself to live in a `not good-enough' world 2 pessimism is not necessarily the product of an emotional problem a character defect or unjustifiable metaphysical assumptions and 3 pessimism can be prudentially appropriate and--perhaps most controversially--is epistemically warranted in an appendix i consider the philosophical challenges posed by radical pessimism and what i call the secular problem of evil
