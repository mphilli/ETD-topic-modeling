arkansas citizenship marshall islands migration race us empire this dissertation examines marshall islander migration to arkansas as an outcome of an international agreement the compact of free association between the us and the republic of the marshall islands rmi a former us territory while the compact marked the formal end of us colonial administration over the islands it also re-entrenched imperial power relations between the two countries at once consolidating us military access to the islands and creating a marshallese diaspora whose largest resettlement site is now springdale arkansas as a result springdale an all-white town for much of the 20th century has recently been remade by marshallese and also latino immigration nearly tripling in size in the past three decades i examine us empire through three interrelated lenses through an imperial policy the compact of free association cofa through an imperial diaspora the marshallese diaspora and through the town of springdale arkansas a new immigrant destination for marshall islanders which i argue has become a new destination of empire these three lenses reveal how empires interrelated workingsmigration militarization racialization labor detention capitalism and the law among othersinform one another to uphold us imperial power and how us empire both engenders and constrains mobility for its subjects i argue that cofa status the visa-free immigration status granted to marshallese immigrants is a type of imperial citizenship and that its partial contingent and revocable character produces precarity for those who hold it placing them alongside other groups of imperial citizens from us non-sovereign territories due to a lack of awareness of us empire however long-term residents in new destinations of empire like springdale are unable to comprehend marshall islanders as imperial citizens instead their interpretations of marshall islanders presence are woven back into dominant narratives of us exceptionalism such interpretations of why cofa status exists exemplify and perpetuate an occlusion of us empire in springdale in other words the refrainwe are here because you were there commonly used to explain the presence of imperial migrants elsewherewas never heard and thus never placed in the context of empire
