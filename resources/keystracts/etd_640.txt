hadrons lhc lhcb pentaquarks the observation of structures consistent with charmonium-pentaquark states decaying to j\psi p in \lambda_b^0 \rightarrow j\psi k^- p decays is presented the data sample analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb^-1 acquired with the lhcb detector from 7 and 8 tev pp collisions an amplitude analysis was performed which utilized all six kinematic degrees of freedom in the decay it was shown that adequate descriptions of the data are unattainable with only k^- p resonances in the amplitude model for satisfactory fits of the data it was found to be necessary to include two j\psi p resonances with each having significances of over 9 standard deviations one has a mass of 44498\pm17\pm22 mev and a width of 39\pm5\pm16 mev while the second is broader with a mass of 4380\pm8\pm29 mev and a width of 205\pm18\pm87 mev the j^p assignments could not be uniquely determined though there is a preference for one to have spin 32 and the other spin 52 with an opposite parity to the first the data sample was also inspected in a model-independent way for the presence of j\psi p or j\psi k^- contributions it was demonstrated at more than 9 standard deviations that the data cannot be described with k^- p contributions alone and that j\psi p contributions play a dominant role in this incompatibility these model-independent results support the model-dependent evidence for p_c^\rightarrow j\psi p charmonium-pentaquark states provided by the amplitude analysis
