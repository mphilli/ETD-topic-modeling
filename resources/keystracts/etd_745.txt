jet multi-stream rectangular supersonic turbulence supersonic flight has become a standard for military aircraft and is being seriously reconsidered for commercial applications  engine technologies enabling increased mission capabilities and vehicle performance have evolved nozzles into complex geometries with intricate flow features  these engineering solutions have advanced at a faster rate than the understanding of the flow physics however  the full consequences of the flow are thus not known and using predictive tools becomes exceedingly difficult  additionally the increasing velocities associated with supersonic flight exacerbate the preexisting jet noise problem which has troubled the engineering community for nearly 65 years  even in the simplest flows the full consequences of turbulence eg noise production are not fully understood  for composite flows the fluid mechanics and acoustic properties have been studied even less sufficiently  before considering the aeroacoustic problem the development structure and evolution of the turbulent flow-field must be considered  this has prompted an investigation into the compressible flow of a complex nozzleexperimental evidence is sought to explain the stochastic processes of the turbulent flow issuing from a complex geometry  before considering the more complicated configuration an experimental campaign of an axisymmetric jet is conducted  the results from this study are presented and guide research of the primary flow under investigation  the design of a nozzle representative of future engine technologies is then discussed  characteristics of this multi-stream rectangular supersonic nozzle are studied via time-resolved schlieren imaging stereo piv measurements dynamic pressure transducers and far-field acoustics  experiments are carried out in the anechoic chamber at syracuse university and focus primarily on the flow-field  an extensive data set is generated which reveals a detailed view of a very complex flow  shear shock waves unequal entrainment compressibility and geometric features of the nozzle heavily influence the development of this jet plume  in the far-field the acoustic radiation is found to be highly directional  noise spectra contain high-frequency tonal signatures and relations to the turbulent structures are made in an effort to explain the physics responsible for such acoustic generationanalysis of the flow is made possible by the carefully planned experiments  by acquiring a large number of simultaneous data points the stochastic processes are studied through statistical approaches  first- and second-order moments are used to describe the steady-state behavior of the flow  the wide array of sensors used in the tests allows for cross-moments to be computed which provide evidence linking different phenomena  proper orthogonal decomposition pod is used to separate flow-field quantities into temporal and spatial pieces which are then further utilized in conjunction with other sensors  through these methods a high-frequency instability is discovered in the near-field of the jet which pervades the flow-field and propagates ubiquitously throughout the acoustic domain  additionally the complex shock structure is found to play a vital role in redistributing disturbances throughout the flow  finally several pod modes in the side shear layer of the jet are found to be correlated with acoustic production
