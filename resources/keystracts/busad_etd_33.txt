mixture models finance market microstructure time durations mixture models are of intensive interest for researchers over the last decade their importance is due to the fact that they provide natural representations for unobserved heterogeneity in the population in addition to medical statistics econometrics and survival analysis the mixture models has also been used in the field of finance this dissertation presents two such applications in financein the first application a common-factor mixture model is developed to investigate relationships of security returns return volatility and trading volume the model generalizes and outperforms the standard mixture of distribution hypothesis mdh model tauchen and pitts 1983 by capturing possible interactions among securities the model implies first common factor structures stem from information effects second cross-firm variations rely both on common factors and information flows finally common factor structures and information flows both have explanatory power beyond information flows in the positive relationship between volatility and volume the model is fitted for intraday data of dow jones 30 stocks using the em algorithm the results show 3-factor structures in both return and trading volume seriesthe second application uses a bivariate mixture transition distribution bmtd time series model hassan 1999 to test the theoretical predictions on the dynamic relationship between time duration between transactions and price volatility a negative interactive time-varying association between time durations and price volatility is embedded in the specifications of the model the bmtd model is different from those models developed in previous studies in two ways first the model relaxes the assumption of exogenous time durations which suggests that prices may have impacts on time durations the model also implies that the impact of prices on time durations changes over time second the model suggests a pareto distribution instead of exponential family distributions for time durations the empirical results support the specifications of the pareto model besides the proposed unvariate mixture transition distribution models for time durations and price volatility tend to outperform the autoregressive conditional duration acd model and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity garch model which are used by other researchers to examine the same issue
