integrity checking process hardening computer security intrusion detection computer intrusions can occur in various ways many of them occur by exploiting program flaws and system configuration errors existing solutions that detects specific kinds of flaws are substantially different from each other so aggregate use of them may be incompatible and require substantial changes in the current system and computing practice intrusion detection systems may not be the answer either because they are inherently inaccurate and susceptible to false positivesnegativesthis dissertation presents a taxonomy of security flaws that classifies program vulnerabilities into finite number of error categories and presents a security mechanism that can produce accurate solutions for many of these error categories in a modular fashion to be accurate a solution should closely match the characteristic of the target error category to ensure this we focus only on error categories whose characteristics can be defined in terms of a violation of process integritythe thesis of this work is that the proposed approach produces accurate solutions for many error categories to prove the accuracy of produced solutions we define the process integrity checking approach and analyze its properties to prove that this approach can cover many error categories we develop a classification of program security flaws and find error characteristics in terms of a process integrity from many of these categorieswe implement proof-of-concept solutions for two most prevalent error categories the buffer overflow and the race condition and analyze their accuracy and performance
