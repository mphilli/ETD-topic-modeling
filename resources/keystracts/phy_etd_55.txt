fuzzy physics quantum field theory regularization noncommutative geometry regularization of quantum field theories qft's can be achieved by quantizing the underlying manifold spacetime or spatial slice thereby replacing it by a non-commutative matrix model or a fuzzy manifold' such discretization by quantization is remarkably successful in preserving symmetries and topological features and altogether overcoming the fermion-doubling problem in this thesis the fuzzification of coadjoint orbits and their qft's are put forward
