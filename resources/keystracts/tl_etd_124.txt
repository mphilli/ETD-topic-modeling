motivation physical education physical education learning environment scale achievement goals perceptions of ability approaches to the study of teaching and learning in physical education have focused largely on identifying teaching processes that lead to learning outcomes in the psychomotor domain it is only recently that researchers have begun to investigate the student initiated processes that may mediate the relationship between teaching and learning lee 1991 these student processes might include perceptions of environment and levels of motivationspecifically the present investigation examined the degree to which intrinsic motivation is predicted from perceptions of learning environment also of interest were relationships between perceptions of environment and other motivational variables such as achievement goals and self perceptions of ability these motivational variables are considered to be important mediators of achievement behavior hall 1990following a pilot study using a sample of 50 middle school students an initial questionnaire was subjected to exploratory data analyses from these analyses the physical education learning environment scale was developed and administered to a larger sample of 622 students in order to establish validity and reliability further exploratory analyses were conducted on responses from 300 of these students hypotheses were tested using the responses of the remaining 322 studentsresults indicated that achievement goals and perceptions of ability are significant predictors of perceived learning environment which itself predicts levels of intrinsic motivation these findings are discussed in terms of their implications for both teachers and researchers in physical education
