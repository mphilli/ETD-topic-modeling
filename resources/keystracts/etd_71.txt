bayesian estimation kalman filtering particle filtering sensor networks target tracking distributed inference arising in sensor networks has been an interesting and promising discipline in recent years the goal of this dissertation is to investigate  several issues related to distributed inference in sensor networks  emphasizing parameter estimation and target tracking with  resource-constrainted networksto reduce the transmissions between sensors and the fusion center thereby saving bandwidth and energy consumption in sensor networks a novel methodology where each local sensor performs a censoring procedure based on the normalized innovation square nis   is proposed for the sequential bayesian estimation problem in this dissertation in this methodology each sensor sends only the informative measurements  and the fusion center fuses both missing measurements and received ones to yield more accurate inference the new methodology is derived for both linear  and nonlinear dynamic systems and both scalar and vector measurements the relationship between the censoring rule based on nis and the one based on kullback-leibler kl divergence is investigateda probabilistic transmission model over multiple access channels macs  is investigated  with this model a relationship between the sensor management and compressive sensing problems is established based on which  the sensor management problem becomes a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to determine the optimal values of probabilities that each sensor should transmit with such that the determinant of the fisher information matrix fim at any given time step is maximized  the performance of the proposed compressive sensing based sensor management methodology in terms of accuracy of inference is investigatedfor the bayesian parameter estimation problem a framework is proposed where quantized observations from local sensors are not directly fused at the fusion center instead an additive noise is injected independently to each quantized observation the injected noise performs as a low-pass filter in the characteristic function cf domain and therefore is capable of recoverving the original analog data if certain conditions are satisfied the optimal estimator based on the new framework is derived so is the performance bound in terms of fisher information moreover a sub-optimal estimator namely linear minimum mean square error estimator lmmse is derived due to the fact that the proposed framework theoretically justifies the additive noise modeling of the quantization process the bit allocation problem based on the framework is also investigateda source localization problem in a large-scale sensor network is explored the maximum-likelihood ml estimator based on the quantized data from local sensors and its performance bound in terms of cram\'er-rao lower bound crlb are derived since the number of sensors is large the law of large numbers lln is utilized to obtain a closed-form version of the performance bound which clearly shows the dependence of the bound on the sensor density ie the fisher information is a linearly increasing function of the sensor density error incurred by the lln approximation is also theoretically analyzed furthermore the design of sub-optimal local sensor quantizers based on the closed-form solution is proposedthe problem of on-line performance evaluation for state estimation of a moving target is studied in particular a compact and efficient  recursive conditional  posterior cram\'er-rao lower bound pcrlb is proposed this bound provides theoretical justification for a heuristic one proposed by other researchers in this area theoretical complexity analysis is provided to show the efficiency of the proposed bound compared to the existing bound
