power f-test two-way anova anova the f-test has been used to detect interactions in two-way anova models however the f-test for the interaction is not as powerful as the f-test for the main effects and its power is often very low if there are only a few disturbances in data under the typical restrictions daniel 1978 and terbeck and davies 1998 reparameterized the model and proposed new statistics to detect the interactions under unconditionally identifiable patterns they showed that their tests are better than the classical f-test and also can identify the locations of the non-zero disturbances however their methods do not work well for the model with non-unconditionally identifiable patternsin this thesis we use the parameterization the same as the one used in daniel 1978 and terbeck and davies 1998 and propose new test statistics to detect non-zero interactions we show that our test is more powerful than the classical f-test and can handle both situations unconditionally identifiable pattern uip and non-unconditionally identifiable pattern for a special 3  3 case we also propose a selection procedure that leads us to choose the best configuration with the highest power under a uip under a non-uip condition simulations illustrate that the selection procedure still works in order to find critical values at a given significance level we suggest using a numerical integration or a polynomial approximation or worsley's approximation 1982for a general i  j case simulations indicate that our test statistic still has a higher power than the classical f-test and we can still apply the selection procedure for the best configuration to the general case due to high dimensional integrations involved the numerical integration and the polynomial approximation are not feasible in finding the critical values we suggest using worsley's approximation 1982 to obtain reasonable accuracies
