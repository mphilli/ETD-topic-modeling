other  difference this dissertation argues for a re-examination of the category otherness after some have argued for difference as the best way of addressing the problem of cultural diversity through an historical examination of european representations of alterity during the early modern era i argue that the term difference is problematic because it suggests an implicit hierarchy and situates a particular western epistemology as universal whereas the term other reflects the incongruity between different culturesafter reviewing and critiquing jonathan z smith's influential and representative typology of other and difference i take up page dubois' analysis of alterity in the hellenistic era to demonstrate that the logical justification of a hierarchical scale of human difference creates conceptual instability by associating otherness with irrationalitythe second chapter examines roger bartra's argument that european wild man mythology provided one of the principal frames for depicting natives americans as natural and wild thus lacking the rational control that characterized european idealsin the third chapter captain john gregory bourke's account of a zuni clown performance provides an example of the conflation of native socio-religious practice with pre-existing european concerns about the conflict between bodily existence and spiritual life a survey of the pueblo clown tradition demonstrates its important moral and religious function as the underlying principle of pueblo worldview bakhtin's analysis of the european carnival tradition demonstrates the conceptual connection between that tradition and the condemnation of the zunithe fourth chapter employs julia kristeva's theory of abjection to understand the way in which otherness is inherently linked to self-identity the abject like the other represents the ambiguous boundary between me and not-me the other appears as a means of differentiating between the familiar and the strange however the strange is always conceived through the familiar the category of otherness helps to remind us that our perception of others is always based on pre-existing categories by realizing that the categories through which we perceive other people are not universal but culturally specific we can begin to appreciate the uniqueness of other worldviews
