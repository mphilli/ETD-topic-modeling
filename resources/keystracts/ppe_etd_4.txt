exercise training venous function hypertension baroreflexes the purposes of these studies were to 1 examine the effects of baroreflex-mediated compared to non-baroreflex mediated increases in sympathetic nervous system activity on calf venous compliance in subjects with prehypertension and stage-1 hypertension high blood pressure group hbp compared to subjects with normal blood pressure nt 2 determine the effects of aerobic exercise training on calf and forearm venous compliance in hbp compared to nt group and 3 examine the effects of aerobic exercise training on baroreflex-mediated modulation of venous compliance in hbp individuals to address the first purpose calf venous compliance was measured in 20 subjects with high blood pressure hbp age 46  1 yr and 13 normotensive controls nt age 44  2 yr at baseline during lower body negative pressure lbnp and during post-handgrip exercise ischemia hgi to address the second purpose both nt and hbp groups underwent a 4-wk cycling exercise training program 4dwk 30-45 min per session 65 heart rate reserve and calf and forearm venous compliance were measured before and after training to address the third purpose calf venous compliance was measured at baseline during lbnp and during lower body positive pressure lbpp in the hbp group before and after the exercise training a 4-wk control non-exercising period preceded the exercise training program changes in calf and forearm volume were measured via a deflation protocol using venous occlusion plethysmography at baseline and during each task lbnp lbpp hgi venous compliance was assessed from the pressure-volume and pressure-compliance curves that were generated from the collecting-cuff pressures and changes in volume during the deflation period of the protocol baseline calf and forearm venous compliance were not different between groups  p  005 the nt group but not the hbp group showed a significant reduction in venous compliance during lbnp  p  005 venous compliance did not respond to hgi in any of the groups  p  005 exercise training reduced systolic blood pressure from 130  1 mm hg to 123  2 mm hg  p  005 and diastolic blood pressure from 91  1 mm hg to 87  1 mm hg  p  005 in the hbp group and improved cardiovascular fitness in the hbp and nt groups  p  005 exercise training affected neither baseline calf nor baseline forearm venous compliance in any of the groups   p  005 application of lbpp but not lbnp reduced venous compliance in the hbp group but this response was not altered with training p005 in conclusion venous compliance was reduced in response to baroreceptor loading lbpp but did not change in response to baroreceptor unloading lbnp and metaboreflex activation hgi in a cohort of subjects with prehypertension and stage-1 hypertension four wks of aerobic exercise training at moderate intensity reduced blood pressure and improved cardiovascular fitness but did not affect either baseline venous compliance or baroreflex-mediated modulation of venous compliance in this population these findings indicate that short-term exercise training does not induce adaptations in sympathetic modulation of venous compliance in prehypertensive and stage-1 hypertensive individuals
