women possessed feminist spirit possession agency postcolonial instrumental agency this dissertation is a historian of religion's approach to the repeated appearance of possessed women across time and cultures informed by post-colonial and feminist perspectives on the study of the religious other beginning with a critique of the major comparative studies of possession written by oesterreich bourguignon and lewis i argue against their interpretive frameworks on the basis that they each employ a reductive model of religious subjectivity which undergirds their analysis and perpetuates biased representations of possessed women specifically i examine how agency is constructed by these authors and argue that given the post-colonial and feminist criticisms of the inherent biases of thoughtaction or beliefpower dichotomies as argued by talal asad and catherine bell it is an opportune time to revisit the problem of interpreting the agency of possessed womeni propose a concept for interpreting the agency of possessed women instrumental agency the concept shifts the discussion of agency away from a model of subjects agents toward the analysis of practices which constitute a receptive subject who is far from passive but instead functions as the instrumental agency through which ancestors deities or spirits remind communities of their historical obligations and do work in the world toward the production of a moral order knowledge of the possessing ancestors deities or spirits is an epistemological impossibility but the concept allows a discursive space for the theological terms by which a people identifies possession phenomena rather than imposing modern psychological interpretations which elide or erase indigenous explanations the concept of instrumental agency indicates that the woman's subjectivity is instrumental for forces external to human consciousnessthe chapters of the dissertatian are organized around the themes of work war and plays examining possession phenomena in malaysia zimbabwe and in the theaters of greek antiquity and yiddish theater in the twentieth century these case studies exemplify the relationship of women's religious lives to systems of power and highlight the specific agency of possessed women
