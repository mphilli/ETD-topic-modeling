leakage power islands switching with the migration to deep sub-micron dsm process technologies the power consumption of a circuit has come to the forefront of concerns and as a result the power has become a critical design parameter this work presents a novel high-level synthesis hls methodology called power islands  that eliminates the spurious switching activity ssa and the leakage in a great portion of the resulting circuit by partitioning it into islands each island is a cluster of logic whose power can be controlled independent from the rest of the circuit and hence can be completely powered down when all of the logic contained within it is idling the partitioning is done in such a way that the components with maximally overlapping lifetimes are placed on the same island by powering down an island during its idle cycles 1 the spurious switching that results from the broadcast to idle components is silenced and 2 the power consumption due to leakage in inactive components is eliminatedduring the execution cycle of a synthesized design each component is either active performing a computation or idle similarly each register is either alive or dead in previous generations of synthesized designs all components active or idle and all registers alive or dead remained on and consumed power the entire time during the execution however our synthesis tool constructs design architectures in such a way that idle functional units and dead registers can be powered down for maximum possible number of cycles during the other cycles of execution they remain onour hls process consists of control data flow graph cdfg extraction from the given intermediate format if scheduling resource binding power island partitioning register binding interconnect allocation and data-path and controller generation tasks verilog is used as the hardware description language hdl for register transfer level rtl design representationsour hls methodology is entirely implemented in c the rtl representations synthesized by our hls tool are translated into the gate-level designs using cadence's rt compiler subsequently cadence's placement and routing tool encounter is used to obtain the layout-level representations extracted transistor and capacitor net-lists from the layout are simulated using cadence's transistor-level simulators spectre or ultrasim to measure and report the power consumption a 65-nm process technology along with berkeley's predictive technology model bptm containing cmos device parameters for this particular feature size is also usedexperiments showed significant savings in power due to power islands  we can safely project that as long as cmos is the underlying choice of process technology for ic designs with the migration to much smaller geometries where leakage becomes hard to control significantly more savings can be gained from our approach
