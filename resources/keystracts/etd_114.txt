airfoil data fusion fluid dynamics jet flow in recent years there have been improvements in the methods of obtaining fluid dynamic data which has led to the generation of vast amounts of data extracting the useful information from large data sets can be a challenging task when investigating data from a single source however most experiments use data from multiple sources such as particle image velocimetry piv pressure sensors acoustic measurements and computational fluid dynamics cfd to name a few knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each measurement technique one can fuse the data together to improve the understanding of the problem being studied concepts from the data fusion community are used to combine fluid dynamic data from the different data sources the data is fused using techniques commonly used by the fluid dynamics community such as proper orthogonal decomposition pod linear stochastic estimation lse and wavelet analysis this process can generate large quantities of data and a method of handling all of the data and the techniques in an efficient manner is required to accomplish this a framework was developed that is capable of tracking storing and manipulating datawith the framework and techniques data fusion can be applied data fusion is first applied to a synthetic data set to determine the best methods of fusing data data fusion was then applied to airfoil data that was obtained from piv cfd and pressure to test the ideas from the synthetic data with the knowledge gained from applying fusion to the synthetic data and airfoil data these techniques are ultimately applied to data for a mach 06 jet obtained from large-window piv lwpiv time-resolved piv trpiv and pressurethrough the fusion of the different data sets occlusion in the jet data were estimated within 6 error using a new pod based technique called fused pod in addition a technique called dynamic gappy pod was created to fuse trpiv and lwpiv to generate a large-window time-resolved data set this technique had less error than other standard techniques for accomplishing this such as pressure-based stochastic estimationthe work presented in this document lays the groundwork for future applications of data fusion to fluid dynamic data with the success of the work in this document one can begin to apply the ideas from data fusion to other types of fluid dynamic problems such as bluff bodies unsteady aerodynamics and other these ideas could be used to help improve understanding in the field of fluid dynamics due to the current limitations of obtaining data and the need to better understand flow phenomena
