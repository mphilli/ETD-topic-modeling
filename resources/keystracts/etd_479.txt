math problem completion ratio schedules risky choice basic research has demonstrated that when given a choice between a reinforcement schedule that requires a fixed number of responses or one that requires a mixed number of responses preference typically emerges for the mixed option even when it requires a larger response requirement  the current study attempted to replicate and extend these findings to math problem completion by fourth-grade students across 5 phases 4 students chose either to complete 5 addition problems per trial fixed-ratio schedule or a mixed number of addition problems per trial mixed-ratio schedule the first mixed schedule examined required either 1 or 9 problems per trial  the number of math problems in the mixed schedule was increased by 20 1 or 11 problems per trial in the subsequent phase the third phase featured a mixed schedule requiring 5 or 7 problems per trial this was followed by a reversal to the preceding phase in which preference for the mixed schedule had been observed and a final reversal back to the phase featuring a mixed schedule requiring 5 or 7 problems per trial  findings were consistent with previous research in that preference emerged for the mixed schedules that required only 1 problem on some trials but did not when the mixed option required 5 or 7 problems  results highlight the importance of small work requirements in the emergence of preference for mixed schedules and offer implications for future studies aimed at encouraging students to choose lengthier assignments
