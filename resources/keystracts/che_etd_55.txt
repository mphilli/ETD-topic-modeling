thermal isomerizations hydrogen shifts deuterium labeling cyclononadienes thermal [15] hydrogen shifts in conjugated cycloalkadienes have been recognized isomerization reactions since the early 1960s recent studies of isomerizations exhibited by deuterium-labeled 13-cyclohexadienes 13-cycloheptadienes and 13-cyclooctadienes have provided activation parameters for these [15] sigmatropic rearrangementsactivation energies for such reactions determined through experimental studies or theoretical calculations may be strongly conditioned by geometrical constraints in transition structures and by ground state conformational effects theory-based and experimental activation energies for the three cyclic dienes that have been investigated are in qualitative agreement but the calculated values are higher than the observed energy barriers by some 18 to 62 kcalmol---a disquieting disagreement towards understanding these discrepancies a specific mono-deuterium-labeled ciscis -13-cyclononadiene has been synthesized and the thermal isomerizations equilibrating it with its four isomers were followed to secure log a and e a values for the hydrogen shifts involved the kinetic experiments providing rate constants from 240c to 287c led to activation parameters e a  371 kcalmol and log a  116 the activation energy is in remarkable agreement with theoretically determined values whether variations in transition structure geometries might correlate with reactant specific tunneling effects on reaction rates and activation parameters for ciscis -13-cycloalkadienes remains to be clarified
