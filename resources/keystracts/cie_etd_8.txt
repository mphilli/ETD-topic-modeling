chemical response surface waters organic soils acidic deposition i studied the changes in lake water chemistry and oa-horizon base status between 1984 and 2001 at 130 stratified random sites across the northeastern us to evaluate the population-level effects of decreases in acidic deposition surface-water so  4   2-  concentrations decreased across the region at a median rate of -153 eq l  -1  yr  -1   calcium concentrations also decreased with a median rate of -173 eq l  -1  yr  -1   this decrease in ca  2  retarded the recovery of surface water acid neutralizing capacity gran anc which increased at a median rate of 066 eq l  -1  yr  -1   there were small increases in ph in all sub-regions except central new england and maine where the changes were not statistically significant median no 3  - trends were not significant except in the adirondacks where no  3   -  concentrations increased at a rate of 053 eq l  -1  yr  -1   i observed a region-wide decrease in the concentration of total al especially in ponds with low anc values anc  25 eq l  -1   in the adirondack sub-region despite the general pattern of chemical recovery many ponds remain chronically acidic or are susceptible to episodic acidification the continued chemical and biological recovery at sites in the northeastern us will depend on further controls on s and n emissionsover the study period median base saturation in oa-horizon soils decreased from 562 in 1984 to 330 in 2001 effective cation exchange capacity normalized to soil carbon concentration showed no significant change between 1984 and 2001 the change in base saturation was the result of almost equivalent changes in exchangeable calcium ca n  and exchangeable aluminum al n  the median ca n declined by more than 50 from 235 to 106 cmol c kgc while median al n more than doubled from 88 to 213 cmol c kgc i observed the greatest change in soil acid-base properties in the montane regions of central new england and maine where base saturation decreased by more than 50 and median soil ph s 001m cacl 2  decreased from 319 to 297 the acidification of oa-horizon soils between 1984 and 2001 occurred despite substantial reductions in atmospheric acidic deposition these results may help to explain the surprisingly slow rate of recovery of surface waters
