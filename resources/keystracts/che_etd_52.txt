rhenium diagnostic therapeutic nuclear medicine technetium radiopharmaceuticals we have explored the coordination chemistry of rhenium in the attempt to develop radiopharmaceuticals as diagnostics and therapeutics in nuclear medicine since rhenium and technetium are group vii congeners the periodic similarity has allowed for the study of the non-radioactive metal rhenium instead of technetium which exists only as radioactive isotopeswe investigated the three components of the conjugate pendant design 1 arylpiperazine and nucleosides as biologically active molecules bams 2 single amino acid chelates saac as bifunctional chelates bfcas for conjugation of small peptides 3 re i co 3    re iii cl 3  and re v o 3 as metal coresfirst we successfully developed a family of bfcas constructed from pyridine imidazole aliphatic amine and carboxylate derivatived single amino acid to provide a tridentate donor set for coordination to the m i co 3   m  tc re core and a linker for attachement to small peptides we also examined the coordination chemistry of the same saac ligands with the re iii cl 3  core second we combined the tridentate chelating moiety with arylpiperazine derivatives with potential applications as brain imaging agents third we coupled the saac ligands with nucleoside analogues to provide potential inhibitors for nucleoside kinases finally we demonstrated the unusual and complex redox reactivity of the re v o 3 core with the simple ligand n-methyl diaminobenzene an observation which raises serious caveats in the design of radiopharmaceuticals
