mathematics this dissertation is devoted to the study of some properties and applications of functions of generalized bounded variationestimates are obtained for the fourier coefficients of a function f whose fourier series has small gaps and whose restriction to a subinterval i of 02pi  fvbari belongs to one of the following classes phi bounded variation wedge bounded variation or v h of canturija a condition is obtained for the absolute convergence of the fourier series of f when fvbari is in v n'alpha  0 lesstheq alpha  12hypotheses for the existence of the stieltjes integral of functions in canturija classes are given and the integral is estimatedit is proved that each space v h is the intersection of all wedgebv classes satisfying certain conditions but is not the intersection of any countable subcollection of these classesfinally a definition is given for a banach space of regulated functions in a manner analogous to that for functions of ordered harmonic bounded variation but using only intervals of equal length and requiring that the functions satisfy a generalized continuity condition it is shown that functions in this space have everywhere convergent fourier series
