notch signaling glp-1 ego-2 lin-12 notch-type signaling plays a fundamental role in regulating the development of metazoans in the gonad of nematode caenorhabditis elegans  the germline mitosismeiosis decision is regulated by somatic gonadal cells including the distal tip cell dtc and the proximal anchor cell ac via glp-1notch signaling although this signaling has four main components more have been isolated that regulate glp-1 signaling activity one of which is the ego-2   e  nhancer of   g   lp-1   gene a genetic enhancer of a  glp-1 loss-of-function lf  mutation glp-1 signaling also regulates embryonic development another notch receptor in c elegans  lin-12 functions in the somamy dissertation research has focused on the molecular identification of the ego-2 gene characterization of its molecular structure and functions and description of its relationship with its paralog alx-1 and other components of the glp-1lin-12notch pathway ego-2 not only promotes glp-1 signaling in both germline and embryonic development but also positively regulates the z1ppp-z4aaa interaction via lin-12 during somatic gonad development suggesting that ego-2 is a general regulator of notch signaling ego-2 activity is mainly required in the soma to promote germline proliferation consistent with the genetic data showing that it acts upstream or in parallel with glp-1 the ego-2lf also causes spe  spe rmatogenesis defect in the germ line and many other somatic phenotypes therefore ego-2 activity is involved in many aspects of development which may or may not involve glp-1notch signaling ego-2 and alx-1 have opposite functions with respect to glp-1 signaling in germline proliferation but act in concert during spermatogenesis suggesting their relationship is complexthe ego-2 protein is predicted to contain a bro1 domain which has been shown to be involved in endocytosis a process which can positively regulate notch signaling in many species based on our data we hypothesize that in the dtc as well as some other somatic gonadal and germ cells ego-2 functions in the endosomal processes to promote notch signaling to further analyze ego-2 function i first assembled a wildtype ego-2 hybrid genomiccdna construct which can rescue some ego-2lf phenotypes i tagged this construct with green fluorescent protein to examine the ego-2 expression pattern in the future
