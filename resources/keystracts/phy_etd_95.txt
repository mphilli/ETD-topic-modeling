overdamped depinning transition condensation different aspects of the overdamped dynamics of elastic manifolds driven through random media have been studied it is known that at zero temperature such systems typically exhibit a continuous depinning transition at a threshold force f\sbt from a pinned state with zero average velocity  v   0 for f  f\sbt to a sliding state with nonzero average velocity  \nu \not 0  for f  f\sbt using the example of an elastic interface driven in l  l-dimensions we study 1 the effect of finite temperature on the depinning transition and 2 the t  0 dynamics at f \ll f\sbt where the interface moves from one pinned state to another in response to a small increment in the driving force we find in 1 that the depinning transition is smeared out by thermal fluctuations and in 2 that the t  0 dynamics at f  f\sbt is composed of a sequence of discharging events or avalanches whose distribution in size has a power-law decay we also study the finite temperature dynamics at small driving forces f \ll f\sbt and find a nonlinear glassy response for the driven medium  v  \sim \exp-\rm const \times f\sp-\mu finally motivated by recent theoretical and experimental work on driven flux-line lattices in type-ii superconductors which suggest that the disorder becomes less relevant at large driving forces we study the t  0 driven dynamics of a sliding charge-density wave cdw at f \ll f\sbt the cdw model is chosen here because while it captures all the essential features of the dynamics of driven elastic manifolds it is simpler than flux-line lattices in that the dynamical field of interest is a scalar rather than a vector the sliding cdw exhibits a first order dynamical transition at a critical driving force f\sbc between rough disorder dominated f  f\sbc and flat f  f\sbc sliding phases where disorder is washed out by the external drive
