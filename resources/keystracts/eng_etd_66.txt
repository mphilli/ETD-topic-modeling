british studies new journalism slum fiction social reform victorian liberalism victorian studies in guilty looks the pain and pleasures of liberal reform in late-victorian britain i argue that late-victorian liberal reformist texts were engaged in producing an ethical spectating subject using adam smith's theory of sympathy to understand the spectacularization of ethics in these reform texts i contend that sympathetic spectatorship was central not only to the formulation of the liberal subject as an ethical subject but also to the imagining of reform as the rescue of victimized working-class and poor individuals in other words i demonstrate how the late-victorian reformist discourse accorded a place of privilege place of the viewer-actor to the liberal subject as one viewing scenes of misery and performing his own ethical self and represented the working classes and the poor as passively waiting for aid i identify the range of affective dynamics arising from the separation of the ethical spectating subject from the visibly suffering individual within liberal reformist narratives as i attend to the work of affect in moments of reformist feeling i also bring the political implications of liberalism's subjective ethics to bear upon questions of aesthetics specifically i examine various representational strategies that enable reform texts to perform a formal closure on class tensions by imagining a submissive and politically malleable working class the four chapters in this dissertation focus on different cultural configurations of liberalism's specular ethics expensive gift-books like london a pilgrimage 1872 and street life in london 1877 display the overlaps between commodity culture and liberal guilt reformist journalism such as how the poor live 1882 and the bitter cry of outcast london 1882 which employs stock melodramatic scenes and characters to represent lower-class misery and slum novels like children of gibeon 1886 and a child of the jago 1896 which either define ethical action mainly as sympathetic spectatorship or offer through the disruption of bourgeois-liberal sympathy a radically different mode of ethical engagement with representations of suffering
