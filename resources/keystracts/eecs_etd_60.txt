mu-calculus instruction-set process calculus temporal logic process algebra ispcal is a formal language well suited for describing synchronous digital systems and it supports hardware composition it is also a calculus with which we can equate one description with another however its original description lacked the ability to express crucial temporal properties of systems such as safety and livenessto provide the ability of expressing temporal properties we have added a temporal logic the modal mu-calculus to ispcal by adding the modal mu-calculus to ispcal we enriched the expressiveness of ispcal so that we can express safety-critical temporal properties of systems and verify that systems satisfy the properties in addition we proved an important proposition of the modal mu-calculus the satisfaction-equivalence proposition this proposition states that bisimilar processes share the same properties the result is a potential great savings in time and effort for property checkingin this thesis we focus on the procedures for adding the modal mu-calculus to isp-cal we implement the syntax and semantics of the modal mu-calculus as conservative extensions to the higher order logic hol4 theorem prover we also prove several propositions of modal mu-calculus in hol such as the satisfaction-equivalence proposition
