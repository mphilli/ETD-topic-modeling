stock markets firm prices lead-lag effects option markets intraday firm level leadlag effects in stock and option markets are examined using vector error correction models which include lagged levels and differenced data for the five firms examined results indicate that stock market leading behavior is generally predominant in particular the levels data suggest an overwhelming tendency for option market prices to move towards the level of stock market prices feedback effects can be detected in lagged differenced data however in four of the five films stock market prices appear to reflect information from the option market more quickly than option market prices reflect news from the stock market in the fifth firm ibm stock market leading behavior is more difficult to ascertain due to strong feedback effects the relative degree of stock market leading behavior appears to vary inversely with cross-sectional differences in option market liquidity however the relationship between liquidity and leading behavior must be considered tentative as the cross-sectional sample of firms is too small to confidently generalize overall the results support a trading cost hypothesis of leadlag behavior in stock and option markets although results indicate that investors may be more concerned with differences in trading costs between markets than with time series within market variation in trading costs stock market leading behavior is stronger in trade data but evident in quote data hence leads appear robust to potential non-trading effects induced by higher percentage bidask effects in option market trading in fact stock market leads appear robust to more general periods of inactive and non-informational trading
