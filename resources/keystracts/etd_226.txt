blameworthiness moral worth praiseworthiness suberogation supererogation in this dissertation i offer a novel account of the moral praiseworthiness of actions that captures our commonsense intuitions while enabling a reasons-based definition of moral supererogation  morally supererogatory actions are typically understood as actions that have moral worth ie an agent who performs such an action is morally praiseworthy for having performed it yet they are beyond the scope of duty  for moral theorists supererogatory actions have proven difficult to accommodate however i show that the definition of moral supererogation my account enables is resistant to objections that threaten competing accountsaccording to my own two-step account of moral worth in determining the moral praiseworthiness of a given action we must begin in the spirit of julia markovits's coincident reasons thesis crt by determining the extent to which the noninstrumental reasons recommending if supererogatory or requiring if obligatory the action coincide with the noninstrumental reasons motivating the agent  in this first step we've determined an overlap percentage figure  next we must consider the moral justifying strength of the competing reasons subjectively confronting the deliberating agent in her deliberative scenario  thus an action a is morally praiseworthy to the extent that i the agent is non-instrumentally motivated by the noninstrumental reasons that either recommend or require a and ii the agent performs a in the face of competing reasons with moral justifying strength
