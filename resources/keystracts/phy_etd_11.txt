higgs boson nmssm upsilon energy we have searched for non-sm-like cp-odd higgs-boson [special characters omitted]  with [special characters omitted]  2 m b   in radiative decays of the 1  s   using 215m 1 s   mesons directly produced in e    e  -  annihilation we investigate [special characters omitted] [arrow right]     -  and [special characters omitted] [arrow right]     -  decay channels no significant signal is found we obtain upper limits on the product of [special characters omitted] 1 s   [arrow right] [special characters omitted]  and [special characters omitted] [special characters omitted] [arrow right]     -   or [special characters omitted] [special characters omitted] [arrow right]     -   our      -  results are almost two orders of magnitude more stringent than previous upper limits our data provides no evidence for a higgs state decaying to     -   with a mass of 214 mev existence of such state was previously proposed as an explanation for 3    [arrow right] p       -  events with     -  mass just above the kinematic threshold claimed by the hypercp experiment our results constrain nmssm mode
