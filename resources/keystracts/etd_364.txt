glutathione interleukin-1  neuroprotection oxidative stress interleukin-1 il-1 a key cytokine driving neuroinflammation in the central nervous system cns is enhanced in many neurological diseasesdisorders including but not limited to ischemic stroke parkinson's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis huntington's disease and alzheimer's disease the dominant view is that il-1 contributes to andor sustains pathophysiological processes however other studies demonstrate that il-1 can play an important role in neural protection and repair it may do so by modifying astrocyte behavior indeed studies from our laboratory demonstrate that il-1 increases the synthesis and release of the antioxidant molecule glutathione gsh from astrocytes and that il-1-treated astrocytes show increased resistance to oxidative stress [he jackman et al 2015] a pathological process that leads to neural damage in the above-mentioned maladies given this the overall goal of this thesis was to study the protective potential of il-1 against oxidant injury in astrocytes neurons and astrocyte and neurons in co-culturewe confirmed that il-1 mediates an increase in extracellular gsh levels in cortical wild-type astrocytic as shown by our laboratory earlier [he jackman et al 2015] and mixed cultures but not neuronal culture il-1-mediated gsh enhancement rendered protection to mixed culture against oxidative stress induced by the stressor tert-butyl hydroperoxide t-booh gsh production and the resultant protection were blocked by the inhibition of gsh transport through mrp1 additionally il-1 failed to increase gsh or to provide protection against t-booh toxicity in chimeric cultures made using il1r1 null mutant astrocytes lacking a functional il-1r1 receptor indicating the necessity of astrocytic signaling for the observed phenomenon overall these findings suggest that under certain conditions il-1 may be an important stimulus for gsh production and consequent neuroprotection through astrocyte-specific signaling
