auslander-reiten condition finitistic extension degree in this thesis we examine modules that have eventually vanishing self-extensions with a view towards better understanding the auslander-reiten conditionin the first part we focus on modules over symmetric algebras using techniques from the representation theory of artin algebras more specifically we examine how the shape of a component in the auslander-reiten quiver of a symmetric algebra is related to the vanishing of self-extensions of the modules it contains we obtain several restrictions on the possible shape of such a component containing a module with eventually vanishing self-extensions for many algebras we are able to describe completely which components may contain a module with eventually vanishing self-extensions we determine the degree in which these extensions must begin to vanish for every module in such a component in particular we identify new conditions which guarantee that a symmetric algebra satisfies a generalized version of the auslander-reiten conditionin the second part we consider all noetherian rings motivated by the results in the first part of the thesis we introduce the finitistic extension degree of a ring we show that rings for which this invariant is finite satisfy the generalized version of the auslander-reiten condition these results extend recent results for rings satisfying another cohomological condition known as auslander's condition we also investigate the relationship between the finiteness of the finitistic extension degree and auslander's condition
