religion philosophy this dissertation is an attempt to formulate a transcultural understanding of contemplative being-in-the-world based on the dynamics of human willing disclosed therein our 'test cases' are st john of the cross and zen master dogen over half the dissertation is devoted to a gathering of data that is to a close textual study in support of our contention that john and dogen and by the broadest kind of implication all contemplatives exhibit very similar psychotransformative strategies we argue that the fundamental aspects of these strategies are variations of the interrelated will-dynamics of attention and intention upon this foundation we proceed to build a theoretical superstructure its central question becomes in what ways are these will-dynamics psychotransformatively potent how do they achieve the apotheosis of meaning and fulfillment contemplative lives often display our first answer is an explanation of how the methodological practice of non-discursive attention the core of the contemplative gesture gradually liberates the psyche from bondage to the innumerable habit-reflexes automatisms fixations and projections which haunt ordinary being-in-the-world this answer also involves a defense of contemplative strategies in the face of the prevailing paradigms of depth psychology we argue that gaining insight into the contents of the unconscious a process quite foreign to religious contemplatives is not a necessary condition for a 'depth' psychology by the same token we argue that the contemplative's chief tool the will is much more than a superficial and impotent reflex of the ego our second answer is that contemplative being-in-the-world offers a singularly profound harmonization of man's dual ontological motives the self-assertive motive and the self-transcending motive in independent works koestler 1978 working from the outposts of biology and physics and becker 1973 revisioning psychoanalysis through rank and kierkegaard have mounted compelling arguments that these polar forces pulse not only at the heart of organismic life but through the whole energic continuum of the universe becker especially suggests that man cannot be whole nor free unless he finds a way of balancing these two fundamental motives or urges and that indeed one's authenticity depends upon the level at which this balance is struck he suggests that the most profound level at which resolution can be achieved is that of non-idolatrous religious faith we take becker's argument a step further proposing that contemplative being-in-the-world is the epitome of such faith for the psychological discipline it demands is expressly directed to purifying faith of all 'idolatry' even unto the most inner altars of the mind if there are indeed such dual ontological motives pulsing in man as in mice and the milky way then the contemplative mode of being-in-the-world provides the most salvific and profound response to those motives that a human being can achieve we suggest that this balance is part of what it means to live in the way--that life john calls union of the divine and human wills and dogen the realization of suchness
