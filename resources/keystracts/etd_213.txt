biological invasions forest ecology leaf economics spectrum photosynthesis plant ecophysiology resource-use efficiency despite the presumption that native species are well adapted to their local environment non-native invaders seem to outperform native plants intuitively it appears paradoxical that non-native species with no opportunity for local adaptation can exhibit greater fitness than native plants with this advantage here i compared traits of native and invasive shrub and liana species in eastern north american ena forests to test the overarching hypothesis that non-native understory species invasive to this region have superior resource-use strategies or alternatively they share the same metabolic tradeoffs as the native flora first at a global scale i addressed the largely untested hypothesis that biogeography places significant constraints on trait evolution reanalyzing a large functional trait database along with species' native distribution data i found that regional floras with different evolutionary histories exhibit different tradeoffs in resource capture strategies second using a common garden to control for environment i measured leaf physiological traits relating to resource investments carbon returns and resource-use efficiencies in 14 native and 18 non-native invasive species of common genera found in ena understories where growth is presumably constrained by light and nutrient limitation i tested whether native and invasive plants have similar metabolic constraints or if these invasive species predominantly from east asia are more productive per unit resource cost despite greater resource costs leaf construction leaf n invaders exhibited greater energy- and nitrogen-use efficiencies particularly when integrated over leaf lifespan efficiency differences were primarily driven by greater mean photosynthetic abilities 20 higher daily c gain and leaf lifespans 24 days longer in invasive species third motivated by common garden results i conducted a resource addition experiment in a central ny deciduous forest to investigate the role of resource limitation on invasion success in the field i manipulated understory light environments overstory tree removal and n availabilities ammonium-nitrate fertilization to create a resource gradient across plots each containing 3 invasive and 6 native woody species invasive species generally exhibited greater aboveground productivity and photosynthetic gains after two treatment years invasive species displayed more pronounced trait responses to the resource gradients primarily light relative to the weaker responses of native species lastly i asked whether species exhibit similar resource-use strategies in their native and invasive ranges i measured leaf functional traits of rhamnus cathartica native to europe invasive in ena and prunus serotina native to ena invasive in europe in populations across central ny and northern france notably i found invasive us populations of r cathartica had markedly greater photosynthetic rates 50 higher and reduced leaf n resorption rates in autumn 30 lower than native french populations contrastingly i found minimal leaf trait differences in p serotina between native us and invasive french populations collectively my results highlight the utility of functional trait perspectives and support a mechanistic explanation for invasion success based on differential abilities of species to convert limiting resources to biomass
