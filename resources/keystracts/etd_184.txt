boron cluster macrocycle nano photovoltaics polythiophene chapter 1 dye-sensitized solar cell dssc efficiencies have not significantly improved in recent years primarily because of their single band gap design limitations in dye absorption energies and the shockley-queisser sq limit dsscs require incident photon energy in the visible spectrum for the cell to produce a usable current while the possibility of absorbing twonear-infrared photons is a known concept for surmounting the sq limit the opportunities presented by mesoporous systems for creating such a sensitizer do not appear to have been studied by incorporating carborane cluster-based macrocyclic compounds as electron reservoirs a number of the inherent limitations in dssc systems can be potentially circumvented including extending the useable photon energy into the ir region by using a multi-photon multi-step mechanism effectively surmounting the sq limitchapter 2 recent experiments with hexagonal boron nitride h-bn have shownsuccessful covalent and non-covalent functionalization of these nanostructures furthermore experiments have also shown that the non-covalent functionalization of boron nitride nanosheets bnns with polythiophene can produce a working photovoltaic device when attached to tio2 nanoparticles as a semiconductor in a manner similar to a dssc this paper explores the characterizations of a new polythiophene-bnns complex as well as attempting to stabilize and functionalize bnns with thiophene based monomers
