ewens sampling mean field species abundance in this thesis we use the multitype mean field voter model as a model of species interaction to obtain results about species abundance briefly we start with the complete graph on n vertices k n  with each site occupied by a particle particles are represented by a value in 0 1 where distinct values represent different species particles then undergo mutation at rate  and are relabeled with a value chosen uniformly from 0 1 particles also give birth at rate 1 and invade any of the other n sites randomly this process has a unique stationary distribution denoted by [special characters omitted]  which is given by the ewens sampling formula for each value in 0 1 that is present in [special characters omitted]  we count the number particles represented by the same value and call that the patch size of the species let k n [ a b ] denote the number of species with patch size in [ a b ] we study the limiting distribution of k n [ a b ] as the mutation rate  tends to 0 which will in turn force [special characters omitted]  in particular we obtain results about [special characters omitted]  and [special characters omitted]  where [special characters omitted]
