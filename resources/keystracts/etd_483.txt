cocrmo corrosion inflammatory cell inflammatory condition metallic biomaterials continue to be the primary materials for medical devices because of their excellent physical and mechanical properties especially for certain implants which need high strength hip spinal shoulder knee etc  however there is no perfect material to meet all the requirements of a medical device  metallic biomaterials are prone to corrosion and wear which has been associated with implant failure osteolysis aseptic loosening pseudo tumor etc  this study focused on investigating how inflammatory cells interact with cocrmo alloy surfaces under simulated inflammatory conditions h2o2 treatment  it is hypothesized that the presence of reactive oxygen species ros in cell culture will affect the viability of inflammatory cells and that when ros interacts with cocrmo alloy surfaces the effect on cell viability is increased  the first part of the study focused on the cell behavior viability and morphology when cultured directly on cocrmo alloy surfaces with different concentrations of h2o2 in the medium 02 mm  1 mm and compared with the same solution conditions but on tissue culture substrate  the electrochemical behavior of cocrmo alloy surfaces was also examined when exposed to inflammatory cells and inflammatory fluid ie medium with h2o2 added  the results show a narrower range of h2o2 concentration for cell viability for the cocrmo group when compared to tissue culture substrate p  005  this indicates that the presence of metal implants during inflammation might raise the ros toxicity towards cells after surgery  inflammatory conditions ie h2o2  inflammatory cells were also found to result in corrosion of cocrmo alloy surfaces  these short-term results raise significant questions about the long-term interactions between ros cocrmo alloy and inflammatory cells
