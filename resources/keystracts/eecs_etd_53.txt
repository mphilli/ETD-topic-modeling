grid-based collaboration shared event model thin client grids are managed internet scale distributed services supporting collaboration and virtual organization collaboration over networks is becoming more and more popular and important in such areas as online conferencing distance education e-science e-business and e-learning we research the topic of shared event collaboration on grid we build three prototypes to investigate the issues from different software models and languages we demonstrate this by making clients collaboration entities collaborate on events taking advantages of the grid for delivery of event messages and the computing powers of the clients' host computers grids are built from web services exchanging messagespeer-to-peer grids exploit the observation that the entities in both p2p systems and grids are autonomous agents peers services whose state is determined by exchanging messages our work addresses peer-to-peer grids and leverages the advantages of both so that they complement each other we have developed collaborative prototypes in powerpoint impress and reviewplus applications to demonstrate this using message oriented middleware naradabrokering message service to provide a grid messaging substrate that can support collaborative grids the work with reviewplus is in interactive data language idl where the complete and proper definitions of event structures are supplied and elegant mechanisms of widget programming are guaranteed the events are systematically and completely defined with respect to structures levels configurations and associated types of event handler routines the prototypes are instantiations of the shared event model and demonstrations of the collaborative peer-to-peer gridsin order to promote the collaborative applications' usefulness and universal accessibility we investigate a thin client collaboration web services client architecture we further develop a theoretical framework in terms of deterministic finite automata to describe our collaborative systems we use the prototypes to define a general approach to shared event collaboration on the grid
