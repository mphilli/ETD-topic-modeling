hiv-1 nucleocapsid protein aptamer nucleic acids ncp7 mutants this dissertation focuses on structural and functional studies related  to the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids and their  applications the work reported here includes two projects the first  part of the thesis is on the mutational and combinatorial analysis of  hiv-1 nucleocapsid protein ncp7 sixteen mutants of ncp7 were  constructed and over-expressed in   e coli   the dissociation constants k d   between the mutant proteins and the major packaging signal in hiv-1  sl3 rna were measured using tryptophan fluorescence titration assay  andor isothermal titration calorimetry itc assay most mutants show  tolerance of the mutation but some mutants including f16a i24a and  k14e-e21k suffered moderate to significant loss of affinity for sl3  rna indicating the roles of the affected residues in the interaction  between ncp7 and sl3 the second part focuses on the development of  methods for aptamer discovery two prototype platforms were set up to  imitate the two main-stream next-generation sequencing ngs  technologies bridge amplification based and emulsion pcr based ngs  technologies proof-of-principle experiments were carried out and  optimized to evaluate the practicality of these platforms in  high-throughput and multiplexed aptamer discovery
