b hadron lifetime b physics hqe lambda b baryon the ratio of the lambda_b baryon lifetime to that of the b0 meson is measured using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 30 fb collected with the lhcb detector using pp collisions at the lhc the lambda_b baryon is observed in the decay mode lambda_b -jpsi p k- while the b0 meson decay used is the well known b0-jpsi pi k- mode where the pik- mass is consistent with that of the k0892 meson the ratio of lifetimes is measured to be 0971-0007-0005 in agreement with theoretical expectations based on the heavy quark expansion using previous determinations of the b0 meson lifetime the lambda_b lifetime is found to be 1476 - 0010 - 0010 ps in both cases the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic
