amplitude analysis particle quantum numbers x3872 the large hadron collider beauty lhcb is one of the several experiments located at the ring of the large hadron collider lhc in geneva the lhcb detector is a single arm forward spectrometer and is designed to perform high precision measurements of charge parity cp violation parameters and rare decays of the beauty and charm hadrons the detector was successfully operated at a center-of-mass energy of 7 tev in 2010 and 2011 and at 8 tev in 2012 over 3 fb-1 of data has been collected by the lhcb the lhcb experiment is also well suited for studies on hadron spectroscopybesides the well established mesons consisting of quark-antiquark pairs qq-bar it has been proposed that exotic qqq-barq-bar mesons could exist one of the candidates for a four-quark state is the charmonium-like state x3872 which was first observed by the belle experiment in 2003 this narrow state has a mass of about 3872 mev which is located in a region of excited charmonium states cc-bar however its mass does not match to any theoretically predicted charmonium state in order to investigate the nature of this anomalous state we analyze its quantum number which is the key for its interpretation the x3872 events are reconstructed from b-x3872k where x3872-pi pi- jpsi  jpsi-mumu- based on 1 fb-1 of 2011 data collected by lhcb detector we implement a method which is guaranteed by statistics to be the most powerful way to discriminate between spin hypotheses namely unbinned likelihood ratio test using full angular phase-space the 5-dimensional analysis shows that 1 hypothesis is preferred with overwhelming significance the only alternative assignment allowed by the previous measurements jpc  2- is rejected with a confidence level equivalent to more than eight gaussian standard deviations this result favors exotic explanations of the x3872 state such as a mesonic molecule or a tetraquark
