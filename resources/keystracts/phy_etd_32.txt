supertubes black strings d-brane string theory in this dissertation we focus on aspects of string theory and general relativity the study of objects of various spatial dimensions or branes have become an intrinsic part of modern string theory here we focus on three concrete topics concerning the physics of branes supertubes quantum d-brane polarization and the stability of black branes we devote the final part of this work to the study of fast travel in 31 dimensional spherically symmetric configurations
