bone regeneration cell mechanobiology shape memory polymers thermoresponsive tissue engineering scaffolds have traditionally been static physical structures poorly suited to mimick the complex dynamic behavior of in vivo microenvironments shape memory polymers smps may address this limitation recent work has achieved two-dimensional cytocompatible smp substrates of which the surface topography can be triggered to control cell behaviors to enable further advances in smart functional tissue engineering scaffolds the goal of this dissertation was to develop a programmable cytocompatible smp scaffold and further investigate potential applications of the smp scaffoldsto achieve this goal in chapter 2 synthesis and characterization of a family of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane poss-containing polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethanes tpus was investigated and the effect of caprolactone content and water plasticization on the glass transition temperature of the tpus was explored in chapter 3 a programmable smp scaffold capable of changing shape and internal architecture under cytocompatible conditions was developed using electrospinning cell morphologycytoskeletal and nuclear alignmentwas found to be directed by shape-memory-actuated changes in scaffold shape and internal architecture furthermore cells remained viable and attached before and after scaffold architectural changethe objective of chapters 4 to 6 was to explore potential applications of programmable cytocompatible smp scaffolds in bone regenerative medicine in chapter 4 the biomechanical feasibility of self-deploying shape memory polymer fixationsmart sleevewas evaluated the in vitro mechanical stabilization of the smart sleeve was compared to intramedullary im nail using a mouse femoral transverse fracture model the torsional mechanical stability provide by the smart sleeve was comparable to the im nail but the bending stability of the smart sleeve was significantly lower than the im nail in chapter 5 the biological functionality of the smart sleeve employed as a supplementary stabilization device was investigated in an in vivo mouse critical-size defect model intraoperative deployment of the smart sleeve could be triggered by 45 c saline irrigation we found that the presence of the smart sleeve did not interfere with the bone healing process between the allograft and the native bone when compared to the allograft alone group finally in chapter 6 the deployable effect of the smp scaffolds on the osteogenic differentiation capacity of human adipose-derived stem cells was evaluated successful osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated by the assessments of mineral deposition alkaline phosphatase activity and gene expression no statistical difference was found between the active scaffolds and the static scaffoldsin this dissertation programmable cytocompatible electrospun smp scaffolds are developed and further employed to demonstrate their potential applications in cell mechanobiology and bone regeneration in chapter 7 conclusions and future directions are discussed and suggested for each chapter of this dissertation
