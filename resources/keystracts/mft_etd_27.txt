parent-adolescent attachment glycemic control adolescents diabetes using bowlby's attachment theory and family systems theories this study explored the associations between parent and adolescent reports of adolescent attachment and glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes i hypothesized that more secure attachment would correlate with better diabetes control as would concordance between parents and adolescents method thirty-one families recruited from a diabetes treatment center or the juvenile diabetes association completed written self-report questionnaires about adolescent attachment inventory of parent and peer attachment ippa armsden  greenberg 1987 demographic data and diabetes control hemoglobin a1c perceived overall control adolescents and parents reported on their perceptions of adolescents' attachment to mothers and fathers results mean hba1c for the sample was 76 sd 114 mothers' perceptions of adolescents' attachment were negatively correlated with adolescents' hemoglobin a1c  r  -42 p  022 neither fathers' perceptions nor adolescents' reports of attachment was significantly correlated with glycemic control adolescents' reports of attachment to mothers and fathers were significantly correlated with perceived control hba1c was correlated with perceived control of all members i found no significant differences between mother and father reports of attachment with their adolescent or for male and female adolescents' attachment to either parent in regression analyses adolescent differences in reports of mother- and father-attachment  p  51 r 2   03 and differences in mothers' and fathers' attachment were not significantly associated  p  65 r 2   10 with perceived control adolescent differences in reports of mother- and father-attachment were not associated with perceptions of control nor were adolescent-mother differences  p  19 r 2   06 adolescent-father differences or mother-father differences in perceptions of adolescent attachment  p  48 r 2   09 conclusions attachment appears to be associated with glycemic control in this population though the mechanisms are unclear however mother perceptions of attachment had the strongest associations with control not adolescent reports parents' abilities to be emotionally responsive engaged trustworthy and autonomy supportive may enable adolescents to manage diabetes more successfully further research is needed to understand the mechanisms through which parent reports of adolescent attachment are associated with glycemic control
