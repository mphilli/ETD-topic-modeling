flux great lakes lake ontario land-cover mass balance mercury in this dissertation i assess mercury dynamics in the lake ontario basin  in four interrelated phases ecosystem mercury concentrations and fluxes were analyzed at increasing scales  each phase is presented in order of increasing scale starting with a reach-by-reach analysis in the seneca river in new york then moving up to an analysis of the lake ontario watershed followed by an assessment of lake ontario and culminating with an estimate of atmospheric mercury exchange for the entire great lakes basinphase 1 of my research is a multi-year study exploring mercury hg dynamics in the three rivers system with particular emphasis on the seneca river in central new york  in addition to bi-weekly water sampling additional field investigations were conducted to estimate elemental hg hg0 volatilization rates from the river and to assess the impacts of zebra mussel metabolism on hg0 volatilization  elemental hg volatilization was estimated at 13 ng m-2 hr-1 for the field season and was positively correlated to incident solar radiation  it appears that the clearing of the water column caused by zebra mussels may increase hg0 volatilization rates due to subsequent increased penetration of incident solar radiation though additional limiting factors are apparent  reach-by-reach hg mass balances were developed for three river reaches to assess the effects of an intervening hypereutrophic lake a zone of intense zebra mussel infestation and contributions from onondaga lake which is contaminated with elevated levels of hg  it was determined that particulate hg thgp is the dominant form of hg in the seneca river and hg flux in the ecosystem is governed by flow characteristics  intervening cross lake serves an important role for hg transport in the seneca river reducing total hg thg flux in the river by over 65 due to deposition of thgp  methylmercury mehg concentration increased over the reach of intense zebra mussel infestation possibly due to support of anaerobic respiration as a result of the zebra mussel oxygen demand  the river reach receiving input from onondaga lake shows a 15 increase in thg flux  net atmospheric hg exchange is in the direction of deposition  however direct atmospheric hg deposition to the water surface plays a minimal role in seneca river reaches representing less than 1 of the fluvial hg flux of the river  overall the seneca river watershed is a sink for inputs of atmospheric hg at a rate of 42 kg yr-1 and the watershed efficiently retains 85 of this hg exporting approximately 5 kg yr-1 to the three rivers confluencefor phase 2 hg speciation and concentrations were measured near the mouths of nine tributaries to lake ontario during two independent field-sampling programs  among the study tributaries mean thg ranged from 09 to 26 ng l-1 mean dissolved hg thgd ranged from 05 to 15 ng l-1 mean thgp ranged from 03 to 20 ng l-1 and mean mehg ranged from 005 to 014 ng l-1  watershed land-cover total suspended solids tss and dissolved organic carbon doc were evaluated as potential controls of hg  significant relationships between thgd and doc were limited whereas significant relationships between thgp and tss were common  methylmercury was largely associated with the aqueous phase and mehg as a fraction of thg was positively correlated to open water land-cover  wetland cover was positively correlated to thg and mehg particle associations  a relation was evident between dense urban land-cover and higher thgp fractionsphase 3 utilized the results of phase 2 to estimate hg flux for ten inflowing tributaries and the outlet for lake ontario  total hg flux for nine study watersheds that directly drain into the lake ranged from 02 kg yr-1 to 13 kg yr-1 with the dominant fluvial thg load from the niagara river at 154 kg yr-1  total hg loss at the outlet st lawrence river was 68 kg yr-1  fluvial hg inputs largely 62 occur in the dissolved fraction and are similar to estimates of atmospheric hg inputs  fluvial mass balances suggest strong in-lake retention of thgp inputs 99 compared to thgd 45 and mehg 22 fractions  wetland land-cover is a good predictor of mehg yield for lake ontario watersheds  sediment deposition studies and coupled atmospheric and fluvial hg fluxes indicate that lake ontario is a net sink of hg inputs and not at steady-state likely due to recent decreases in point source inputs and atmospheric hg depositionin phase 4 rates of surface-air hg0 fluxes in the literature were synthesized for the great lakes basin glb  for the majority of surfaces fluxes were net positive evasion   annual hg0 evasion for the glb was estimated at 77 mg yr-1 whereas hg deposition to the area is estimated at 159 mg yr-1  this analysis therefore suggests the glb is a net sink for atmospheric hg  land-cover types that contributed most to the annual hg0 evasion for the glb are agriculture 55 and forest 25 and the open water of the great lakes 15  most land-cover types displayed similar areal evasion rates with a range of 70 to 210 g m-2 yr-1  the highest rates were associated with urban 126 g m-2 yr-1 and agricultural 210 g m-2 yr-1 lands  considerable uncertainty was noted in estimates of hg0 evasion  methods used to estimate hg0 evasion vary and results are affected based on the methods applied  a unified methodological approach could partially remedy uncertainty in estimating hg0 fluxes
