polypropionate-derived acyclic systems streptovaricin d the construction of polypropionate-derived acyclic systems by the iterative application of 2 3 -wittig rearrangements is the subject of this dissertationa stereocontrolled linear approach to the synthesis of carbon chains of adjacent secondary hydroxyl and secondary methyl groups based on the use of 2 3 -wittig rearrangements of \alpha-alkoxy tertiary allylic oxazoline ethers is described 2 3 -wittig rearrangements establish trisubstituted olefinic templates which are then hydrated to establish key structural and stereochemical elements in target molecules complementary protocols for the hydration of these olefinic templates are discussedthe utility of the 2 3 -wittig approach is demonstrated in the preparation of the c5-c15 portion of streptovaricin d an ansamycin with activity against both bacterial and viral nucleic acid polymerase systems successive 2 3 -wittig rearrangements establish the c9-c10 and c5-c6 connections and stereocontrolled hydroborations introduce the c7-c8 and c11-c12 stereocenters of the streptovaricin d ansa subunit
