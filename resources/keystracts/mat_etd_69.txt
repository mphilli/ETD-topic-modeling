fullerenes clar number fries number chain decompositions a fullerene is a 3-regular plane graph consisting only of pentagonal and hexagonal faces fullerenes are designed to model carbon molecules the clar number and fries number are two parameters that are related to the stability of carbon molecules we introduce chain decompositions a new method to find lower bounds for the clar and fries numbers in chapter 3 we define the clar structure for a fullerene a less general decomposition designed to compute the clar number for classes of fullerenes we use these new decompositions to understand the structure of fullerenes and achieve several results in chapter 4 we classify and give a construction for all fullerenes on v vertices that attain the maximum clar number v6 - 2 in chapter 5 we settle an open question with a counterexample we construct an infinite family of fullerenes for which a set of faces attaining the clar number cannot be a subset of a set of faces that attains the fries number we develop a method to calculate the clar number directly for many infinite families of fullerenes
