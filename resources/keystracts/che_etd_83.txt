metallaborane carborane nonlinear optical molecular nanosystems the work described here consists of the synthesis and characterization of new borane cluster compounds including large metallaboranes and substituted carboranes that are intermediates to new nonlinear optical materials and molecular nanosystemsthe first chapter of this work describes the synthesis of two new nineteen-vertex metallaborane compounds [ch 3  4 n][b 18 h 20 ni 5 -c 5 h 5 ]  14b  and [b 18 h 19 2-thfni 5 -c 5 h 5 ]  15  the reaction of anti -b 18 h 22 with nickelocene affords the new compounds 14b and 15  complete spectroscopic analysis and a single crystal x-ray study are reported and discussed for both compounds this chapter also contains a discussion of the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of the first exo -bound organometallic fragment to an anti -b 18 h 22 cluster [9-feco 2  5 -c 5 h 5  anti -b 18 h 21 ]  13  also presented are some photochemical reactions of these non- closo macropolyhedral metallaborane clustersthe synthesis and complete characterization of a new linked bis- ortho -carborane species 11 ' -bis ortho -carborane-3-fluorenol  23  is reported in the second chapter of this work the synthesis of compound 23 begins with bis- ortho -carborane which is first deprotonated and then reacted with methyl formate to afford 11 ' -bis ortho -carborane-3-fluorenol  23  the complete spectroscopic characterization and the x-ray crystal structure of 23 are reported here this new compound contains a five-membered ring that is comprised completely of carbon atomsthe third chapter of this work discusses the synthesis and characterization of a series of compounds that should lead to the preparation of new boron-based nonlinear optical materials with para -carborane as the primary structural unit complete spectroscopic characterization is presented for six previously unknown substituted para -carborane compounds including [1-1-c 7 h 7 -12-h-c 2 b 10 h 10 ]  33  [1-1-c 7 h 7 -12-c 5 h 4 -1-oh-34-ch 3  2 -c 2 b 10 h 10 ]  35  [1-1-c 7 h 7 -12-c 5 h 3 -34-ch 3  2 -c 2 b 10 h 10 ]  36  [1-4-c 7 h 7 -12-c 5 h 3 -34-ch 3  2 -c 2 b 10 h 10 ]  37  [1-4-c 7 h 7 -12-c 5 h 2 -3-cn-34-ch 3  2 -c 2 b 10 h 10 ]  310  and [1-4-c 7 h 7 -12-c 5 h-35-cn 2 -34-ch 3  2 -c 2 b 10 h 10 ]  311  the x-ray crystal structure analyses of compounds 33  37  and 310  are also provided in this chapter
