compact sets harmonic functions jensen measures potential theory restoring coverings subharmonic functions the primary goal of this work is to extend the notions of  potential theory to compact sets there are several equivalent ways to define  continuous harmonic functions hk on a compact set k in [the set of real numbers]n one may let hk  be the uniform closure of all functions in ck which are restrictions of  harmonic functions on a neighborhood of k or take hk as the subspace of ck  consisting of functions which are finely harmonic on the fine interior of k in  [9] it was shown that these definitions are equivalent
