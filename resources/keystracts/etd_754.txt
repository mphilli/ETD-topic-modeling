electroosmotic flow nanomaterials self assembly supported lipid bilayers materials that take advantage of the exceptional properties of nano-meter sized aggregates of atoms are poised to play an important role in future technologies prime examples for such nano-materials that have an extremely large surface to volume ratio and thus are physically determined by surface related effects are quantum dots qdots and carbon nanotubes cnts the production of such manmade nano-objects has by now become routine and even commercialized however the controlled assembly of individual nano-sized building blocks into larger structures of higher geometric and functional complexity has proven to be much more challenging yet this is exactly what is required for many applications that have transformative potential for new technologies if the tedious procedure to sequentially position individual nano-objects is to be forgone the assembly of such objects into larger structures needs to be implicitly encoded and many ways to bestow such self-assembly abilities onto nano objects are being developed yet as overall size and complexity of such self-assembled structures increases kinetic and geometric frustration begin to prevent the system to achieve the desired configuration in nature this problem is solved by relying on guided or forced variants of the self-assembly approach  to translate such concepts into the realm of man-made nano-technology ways to dynamically manipulate nano-materials need to be devisedthus in the first part of this work i provide a proof of concept that supported lipid bilayers slbs that exhibit free lateral diffusion of their constituents can be utilized as a two-dimensional platform for active nano-material manipulation we used streptavidin coated quantum dots q-dots as a model nano-building-block q-dots are 0-dimensional nanomaterials engineered to be fluorescent based solely on their diameter making visualization convenient  biotinylated lipids were used to tether q-dots to a slb and we observed that the 2-dimensional fluidity of the bilayer was translated to the quantum dots as they freely diffused the quantum dots were visualized using wide-field fluorescent microscopy and single particle tracking techniques were employed to analyze their dynamic behavior next an electric field was applied to the system to induce electroosmotic flow eof which creates a bulk flow of the buffer solution the quantum dots were again tracked and ballistic motion was observed in the particle tracks due to the electroosmosis in the system this proved that slbs could be used as a two-dimensional fluid platform for nanomaterials and electroosmosis can be used to manipulate the motion of the q-dots once they are tethered to the membranenext we set out to employ the same technique to carbon nanotubes cnts which are known for their highly versatile mechanical and electrical properties however carbon nanotubes are extremely hydrophobic and tend to aggregate in aqueous solutions which negatively impacts the viability of tethering the cnts to the bilayer fluorescently staining and then imaging them first we had to solubilize the cnts such that they were monodisperse and characterize the cnt-detergent solutions we were able to create monodisperse solutions of cnts such that the detergent levels were low enough that the integrity of the bilayer was intact we were also able to fluorescently label the cnts in order to visualize them and tether them to a slb using a peptide sequence future directions of this project would include employing eof to mobilize the cnts and use a more sophisticated single particle tracking software to track individual cnts and analyze their motion
