cognitive interference daily diary daily memory failures everyday cognitive failures assessing how well an individual can meet real world cognitive  demands is an important clinical outcome particularly for older adults  research examining real world cognitive functioning has used both lab-based  tasks as well as questionnaires however these assessments were limited for a  number of reasons lab-based tasks lack personal relevance which may affect the  strategies and amount of effort individuals apply reducing their ecological  validity questionnaires are considered more ecologically valid but require  individuals to recall cognitive failures over weeks and months depending on an  individual's fallible cognitive ability to remember their mistakes over long  periods of time more recent research has attempted to develop methods for the  daily reporting of cognitive failures but focus primarily on memory failures and  ignore more general types of cognitive failures these daily diary studies also  failed to assess the impact of cognitive failures on daily functioning the  current study built on this previous research and introduced a set of assessment  tools designed to capture missed activities memory failures and difficulties  with attention and concentration that individuals experience on a daily basis as  well as the impact of these events on daily functioning one hundred thirty-one  participants 20 to 80 years old completed these assessments once each day for a  period of seven days as well as a series of lab-based cognitive tasks these  data revealed that participants reported missing the most activities due to  overload eg running out of time but found missing activities due to somatic  complaints as the most bothersome with regard to daily memory failures  participants reported equal numbers of retrospective and prospective memory  failures but reported expecting more future consequences from prospective memory  failures older participants reported experiencing more missed activities and  memory failures but rated these events as less bothersome less interfering and  as less likely to bring about future consequences compared with younger adults  daily failures of attention and concentration were captured using a likert-style  scale that assesses cognitive interference this questionnaire exhibited  adequate reliability and factor structure both between- and within-persons and  tapped a construct separable from negative affect finally there was evidence  of weak relationships among self-reported cognitive failures and objective  cognitive performance findings are discussed relative to previous research on  self-reported cognitive failures the importance of assessing other daily  processes and their effects on daily cognitive failures and the continued lack  of relationship between self-reported cognitive failures and objective cognitive  performance
