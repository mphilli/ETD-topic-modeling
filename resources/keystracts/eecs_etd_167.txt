processor allocation scheduling task graphs heterogeneous computing environments efficient application scheduling is critical for achieving high performance in heterogeneous computing environments an application is represented by a directed acyclic graph dag whose nodes represent tasks and whose edges represent communication messages and precedence constraints among the tasks the general task-scheduling problem maps the tasks of an application on processors and orders their execution so that task precedence requirements are satisfied and a minimum schedule length is obtained the task-scheduling problem has been shown to be np-complete in general cases as well as in several surface provides description only full text is available to proquest subscribers ask your librarian for assistance cases although a large number of scheduling heuristics are presented in the literature most of them target homogeneous processors existing algorithms for heterogeneous processors are not generally efficient because of their high complexity and the quality of their results this thesis studies the scheduling of dag-structured application tasks on heterogeneous domains we develop two novel low-complexity and efficient scheduling algorithms for bounded number of heterogeneous processors the heterogeneous earliest-finish-time heft algorithm and the critical-path-on-a-processor cpop algorithm the experimental work presented in this thesis shows that these algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of performance schedule length ratio speed-up and frequency of best results and cost running time and time complexity our experimental work includes randomly generated graphs and graphs deducted from real applications as part of the comparison study a parametric graph generator is introduced to generate graphs with various characteristics we also present a further optimization of the heft algorithm by introducing alternative methods for task prioritizing and processor selection phases a novel processor selection policy based on the earliest finish time of the critical child task improves the performance of the heft algorithm several strategies for selecting the critical child task of a given task are presented this thesis addresses embedding the task scheduling algorithms into an application-development environment for distributed resources an analytical model is introduced for setting the computation costs of tasks and communication costs of edges of a graph as part of the design framework of our application development environment a novel two-phase distributed scheduling algorithm is presented for scheduling an application over wide-area distributed resources
