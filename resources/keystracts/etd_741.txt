judicial impact judicial power policy change supreme court in this dissertation i seek to answer the question when how and under what conditions does the supreme court make or influence policy and politics in the united states in working to answer this question i demonstrate that the supreme court has significantly more power and influence than scholars have typically given it credit for i argue that the nature of the courts power is interpretive it is the power to say what the law is this power gives the court the ability to make policy routinely in every case that comes before it often the exercise of this policymaking power is mundane but sometimes it is profound by shifting focus away from compliancethe dominant focus in the empirical literature on court powerand towards interpretation i significantly extend the range of cases and the scope of outcomes of decisions covered by the theory of power finally this theory of power allows me to develop a theory of judicial impact i contend that judicial impact has two key sources judicial power and indirect judicial influence by which i mean any action which is attributable to an exercise of judicial power but which is not a direct outcome of any power relationship for example political elites respond to court decisions other institutions rationally anticipate court action and judicial decisions can incentivize or discourage activism lobbying legislation litigation and more in short this points to the utility of expanding the study of judicial impact to encompass all policy-relevant outcomes of judicial action and the theory offered here provides an anchor for this approach as well as a framework for systematizing a wide range of different impacts i go on to show that the courts indirect influence can be seen in that its decisions routinely affect media coverage of the issues on which it speaks as well the policymaking agendas of the president and the political parties in other words i show that the court indirectly influences policy in a number of ways one of which is to alter the political agenda of the public and of other policymaking institutions in the united states
