heterogeneous catalysis ketone hydrogenation levulinic acid microkinetic modelling ruthenium solvent effects a kinetic investigation of the production of y-valerolactone gvl via the aqueous phase hydrogenation of levulinic acid la over supported ru catalysts was carried out in order to understand how to better design a hydrogenation catalyst for such biomass catalytic strategies at temperatures representative of biomass processing the reaction proceeds first through the reduction of the la ketone group to its corresponding alcohol 4-hydroxypentanoic acid hpa which subsequently produces gvl via intramolecular esterification in solution the governing kinetics of la hydrogenation were found to be insensitive to the identity of the support material on which ru catalysts were prepared conversely the stability of supported ru catalysts in the aqueous phase were strongly dependent on the choice of support exhibiting severe sintering of ru nanoparticles the extent of which appears to be dictated by the bulk electronegative properties of the support materialthe presence of a secondary functional group in la ie a carboxyl group does not appear to perturb the activity of ru sites in water where la and its mono-functional ketone analog 2-pentanone hydrogenate at identical rates la hydrogenation thus appears kinetically equivalent to that of 2-pentanone given the similarity c3-c5 ketone hydrogenation over rusio2 in the vapor-phase was examined alleviating the need to consider solution phase complexities a single universal microkinetic model for the hydrogenation of ketones over supported ru catalysts was developed based on a modified horiuti-polanyi-type mechanism involving two distinct surface sites through the application of surface lateral interactions to the developed ketone microkinetic model solvent effects commonly reported for hydrogenations over ru catalysts are rationalized on the basis of the stabilization of a kinetically relevant transition state
