rts1 cdc55 encoding regulatory subunits protein phosphatase 2a saccharomyces cerevisiae protein phosphatase 2a pp2a is a major serinethreonine phosphatase in eukaryotic cells its activity has been implicated in the control of many cellular processes it is a heterotrimeric complex comprised of a catalytic a structural and a regulatory subunitin saccharomyces cerevisiae rts1 encodes a regulatory subunit of pp2a rts1 cells are temperature sensitive for growth and have a global stress response defect in order to find out what other cellular functions require rts1  a search for multicopy suppressors of the temperature sensitive rts1 -null cells was carried out the genes clb2 pir2 msb1 ph085  ylr426w and cak1 were found to be multicopy suppressors as indicated by the suppressors' functions rts1 -null cells were found to have a g2m delay at 37c weakened cell walls at 37c and a possible budding defect at 39cthe mechanism of ts suppression achieved by overproducing clb2 was further investigated we found that clb2p levels in cells arrested in s phase was decreased relative to that seen in wild type cells and this decrease was shown to be caused by the anaphase-promoting complex apc-dependent ectopic degradation in investigating the role of two apc regulators we also found that the ectopic degradation of clb2p in rts1 -null cells was cdc20p-dependent but cdh1p-independentloss of cdc55  another regulatory subunit of pp2a causes the cells to exhibit a failure of cytokinesis and the production of abnormally elongated buds at low temperature as cdc55 -null cells exhibit a hyperphosphorylation of y19 on the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc28 we examined wild type and cdc55 -null cells for the levels and activities of the kinase swe1p and phosphatase mih1p that normally regulate the extent of this phosphorylation our results showed that mih1p contributed little to this hyperphosphorylation by contrast swe1 kinase was significantly elevated in mitosis arrested cdc55 -null cells this excess buildup of swe1p in cdc55 -null cells is the result of ectopic stabilization of this protein during g2m phase present evidence indicating that this is a result of a gain-of-function of pp2a complexes lacking cdc55p my work shows that different pp2a regulatory subunits are required for the proper function of distinctly different cell cycle related pathways
