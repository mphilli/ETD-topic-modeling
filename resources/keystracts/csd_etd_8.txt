monotic magnitude-intensity functions prior conditioning stimulus two experiments were performed to study short-term poststimulatory effects in the acoustic stapedius reflex in five normal-hearing volunteers in experiment 1 monotic magnitude-intensity functions mifs were obtained for a 20-ms test stimulus preceded by a conditioning stimulus varying in duration 20 50 100 500 ms and level -10 0 10 db re stapedius-reflex threshold the conditioner and test stimuli were separated by various interstimulus intervals 0 20 50 100 500 ms experiment 2 was similar in design except that fewer interstimulus intervals were used and stimulus presentation was dichoticboth experiments demonstrated that a prior conditioning stimulus produced significant increases in stapedius-reflex response magnitude these poststimulatory increases in stapedius-reflex magnitude were characterized by complex interactions among stimulus variables with similar interactions occurring for both monotic and dichotic stimuli a simple superposition effect of the responses to the conditioner and test stimulus does not account for the effect of prior stimulation since substantial increases in test-stimulus magnitude persisted after the decay of the conditioner response these data suggest that the major effect of prior stimulation on stapedius-reflex magnitude occurs central to the first-order neuron in the stapedius-reflex arc
