p-harmonic calculus of variations nonlinear pdes the main subject of this dissertation is the geometry of  p  -harmonic mappings and related topics the class of quasiradial mappings in the plane is introduced and their basic properties are investigated we discuss generating p  -harmonic functions and mappings via compositions and observe that in several cases only composition with an affine function produces new p  -harmonic functions or mappings this illustrates the rigidity of p  -harmonic mappingsthe variational interpretation of p -harmonics leads to several problems and generalizations we present radial p -harmonics on ring domains and show solvability of the dirichlet problem existence of four fundamental solutions is proven and their geometric properties are presented we generalize the p -dirichlet energy to the weighted case free-lagrangians are discussed as well next we investigate homeomorphisms with finite distortion and relate them to p -harmonic mappings the planar grtzsch problem is extended to higher dimensions and exposed in connections with polyconvex quasiconvex and rank-one convex functionals we define the grtzsch property for energy functionals and show that it holds for a wide class of polyconvex energy functionalsto every p -harmonic mapping in the plane with p  2 there corresponds a quasilinear system of first order pde's which couples the complex gradients of the coordinate functions of the mapping the ellipticity of such system is proved a relation between planar quasiregular mappings and p -harmonic mappings is discussed the p -harmonic conjugate problem is statedwe finish the exposition with some open problems in the geometry of nonlinear systems
