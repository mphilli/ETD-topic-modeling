long-range temporal dependence neural spiking cortical neurons in the last decade-and-a-half a number of unexpected statistical properties have been found in the pulsatile activity of neurons in many sensory systems these properties have been variously called fractal behavior self-similarity 1f fluctuations and long-duration correlation in this dissertation we develop a cohesive and robust theory of long-range dependence in point processes that subsumes these statistical properties and connects them to the much broader mathematical and scientific literature on long-range dependence in general stochastic processes as this theory is developed we examine ways in which the presence of long-range dependence can be used to discriminate between potential models of neural processing and analyze ways in which it can undermine standard statistical analyses of neural activitywe first study integrate-and-fire models of cortical processing that were designed to explain the high variability of the activity in cortical neurons to see if they can also produce long-range dependence since a large number of these models produce renewal-process outputs we prove analytically that such models cannot simultaneously possess long-range dependence and physiologically realistic variability we then consider integrate-and-fire models with renewal point process inputs by analyzing the outputs of simulations we show that these models can possess long-range dependence and realistic variability if the interval distribution of their inputs has infinite variance since this latter requirement contradicts empirical results we suggest a new integrate-and-fire model with long-range dependent inputs having finite interval-variance through the use of simulations we show that this model is able to produce both long-range dependence and realistic variabilitywe also explore the impact that long-range dependence has on empirical estimates of the mean standard deviation and variance of spike counts in neural activity we derive mathematical formulae for the actual mean and variance and for the statistical behavior of sample mean and sample variance estimators for a model neuron using these formulae and simulations of the model we show that long-range dependence significantly increases the variability of the sample mean and causes the sample standard deviation and sample variance to be negatively biased the significance of these results for existing empirical measurements is demonstrated
