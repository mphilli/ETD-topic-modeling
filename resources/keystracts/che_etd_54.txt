hiv-1 nucleocapsid rna packaging aptamers the hiv-1 nucleocapsid protein ncp7 plays several vital roles in the lifecycle of hiv and thus presents a valuable new target for drug discovery a fluorescence based binding assay for ncp7 was developed that allows the measurement of ncp7 affinity for specific regions of the hiv-1 genome and can be adapted to develop a competition assay for ncp7 utilizing this assay the affinity of ncp7 for four apical stem loops and two internal stem bulges within the hiv-1 packaging region have been determined also a total of three ncp7 proteins were found to bind a 154mer encompassing the majority of the hiv-1 packaging region within the hiv-1 packaging region one stem loop sl3 is responsible for approximately 90 of packaging efficiency in order to better understand the determinants of sl3 affinity for ncp7 we modified the sequence and size of sl3 from this study it was determined that the guanine bases at positions 318 and 320 are primarily responsible for affinity to ncp7 also a stem of four base pairs is necessary to maintain strong affinity for ncp7 finally aptamers for ncp7 developed by other groups were tested for affinity to ncp7 utilizing our assay these longer aptamers were found to bind multiple ncp7 proteins and to contain smaller stem loops with the tight binding gug sequence in the apical loop as determined by the mfold program binding assays performed with these smaller stem loops seem to indicate these are the regions of the aptamers responsible for ncp7 affinity
