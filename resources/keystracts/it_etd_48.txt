routines coordination work hospitals workflow medical errors many work processes take place through routines or recurrent patterns of action these activities involve individuals from several occupations working across spatial temporal and organizational boundaries crossing these professional temporal and spatial boundaries has unique challenges which can lead to coordination failures in these conditions facilitating communication and relationships between team members can improve coordination and prevent errorsthis is of particular importance in healthcare provider organizations where coordination and communication failures are a common cause of medical errors the healthcare industry is characterized by increased specialization of work hierarchy shifts and various organizational affiliations thus patient care occurs through a series of interconnected coordination routines these routines often involve handoffs of the patient across boundaries thus the staff must also work across these boundaries in the course of providing patient care if this is not done effectively this can lead to errorsin order to address these issues a multi-method single-site case study was conducted in the interventional cardiology unit of a community hospital ideal type routines were identified through document review and interviews they were validated with the participants and changed as necessary observations were conducted of the routines in practice differences between the ideal routine and routines in practices were identified and analyzed using a coding scheme adopted from the coordination routine and boundary literature issues in the observed routines were also identified and categorized the relational coordination survey was also administered to determine if there were cross-functional differences in communication and relationships throughout the routinedifferences between the ideal routine and routines in practice were often due to systemic factors these included different understanding of the routines by staff inconsistent documentation and lack of exception procedures differences between the ideal routine and routine in practice resulted in changes in workflow that had impacts beyond the coordination routine for coordination routines with high variability and good communication and relationships between the participants differences from the ideal-type routine were less likely to lead to issues in coordination routines with less expected variability and poor communication and relationships differences from the ideal-type routine are more likely to lead to issues this means both the variability and the quality of communication and relationships served as mediating factors for issuesthe study utilized concepts from the routines boundary theory and coordination theory literatures while this is useful to inform interdisciplinary work this is particularly valuable for healthcare informatics because much of the literature in this area is descriptive thus the conceptual framework can be used to inform future study of interdisciplinary work in and out of healthcare this also furthers the work that has been previously done about routines the findings can also be used by managers and team members to develop and implement flexible standards to serve as coordination mechanisms across temporal spatial and occupational boundaries
