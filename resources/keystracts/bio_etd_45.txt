cell signaling glp-1 caenorhabditis elegans germline development signaling between cells is required for the proper specification of cell fate during the development of multicellular organisms in caenorhabditis elegans an inductive interaction between the somatic distal tip cells dtcs and the distal germline is essential in order to maintain proliferation in the developing germline this cell signaling relies on a conserved signaling pathway with three known components the lag-2 ligand glp-1 receptor and lag-1 effector these proteins are homologous to members of notch signaling pathways which function in multiple aspects of drosophila development as well as the development of a number of vertebrate species in order to identify other components of the lag-2glp-1lag-1 mediated signaling pathway extragenic suppressors  sog mutations and enhancers  ego mutations of a weak glp-1 loss-of-function  lf  phenotype in the germline have been isolated the studies in this thesis focus on three genes that interact with glp-1 in germline development a suppressor sog-10  and two enhancers ego-2 and ego-1  the sog-10 mutation suppresses glp-1  lf  germline defects and feminizes xx germlines genetic studies of sog-10 have narrowed the map position of the sog-10 gene to a well defined region of chromosome iii and phenotypic analyses of the sog-10 mutant phenotype indicates involvement of sog-10 in both germline proliferation and sex determination an analysis of the phenotype of the ego-2 mutation has identified it as a strong enhancer of both the germline defect and the maternal effect lethality of glp-1  lf  mutations mutations in ego-1 are able to enhance the germline phenotypes of both glp-1  lf  and lag-1  lf  mutations e maine unpublished in addition ego-1 mutants exhibit various germline abnormalities in a glp-1 wildtype background which indicate defects in germline mitosis andor meiotic prophase the gene responsible for the ego-1 germline phenotype was first detected as a small deletion on chromosome i associated with a uv-induced allele ego-1  om84  the ego-1 gene was sequenced and confirmed to be the one responsible for the phenotypes in ego-1 mutants by pcr amplifying and sequencing this gene region from three strains containing ego-1 mutations om84 om97  and om71  the predicted ego-1 protein contains 1632 amino acids northern analysis identified a transcript of 52 kb which is developmentally regulated and primarily germline specific ego-1 mrna is detected in later larval and adult stages which is consistent with the germline specific phenotype of the ego-1 mutants sequencing of the ego-1 gene region revealed a second ego-1 related gene which is immediately adjacent to ego-1 on chromosome i in addition sequence comparison searches for ego-1 homologs have identified two other proteins in c elegans  five proteins which have been identified as rna-directed rna polymerases rdrp in tomato wheat tobacco petunia and arabidopsis and two uncharacterized proteins one in arabidopsis and one in the yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe
