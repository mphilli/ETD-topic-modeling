condensed phases kinetics pah photochemistry photolysis pollutants condensed phases in the atmosphere such as cloud droplets and aerosols often contain both water and organic matter om reactivity can differ significantly between aqueous and organic phases we have measured photolysis kinetics of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs anthracene and pyrene in several organic solvents and in water in miscible and phase-separated aqueous-organic mixtures in the presence of halide salts nacl nabr and nai and in simulated seawater moreover the roles of singlet oxygen and ph were investigated on the kinetics at atmospherically-relevant wavelengths photolysis rate constants generally increased with increasing solvent polarity our results suggest that om could greatly affect the photochemical lifetimes of pahs in atmospheric condensed phases such as aerosols even if the om does not itself absorb photons our results also indicate that the fate of pahs in saline waters such as oceans and atmospheric particulate matter could be significantly different than those predicted by kinetics measured in deionized water
