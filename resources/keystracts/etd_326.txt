 prenylation is a lipidation post-translational modification wherein a hydrophobic isoprenoid group is attached to a protein at the cysteine of a c-terminal ca1a2x target sequence by protein farnesyltransferase ftase or protein geranylgeranyltransferase type i ggtase-i  this modification and subsequent processing steps aid in protein localization to cellular membranes  while many peptide sequences have been shown to be substrates for the protein prenyltransferases in in vitro assays it is unclear how many of these sequences can successfully compete for prenylation by ftase or ggtase-i within the pool of potential substrate proteins within the cell to address this uncertainty we aim to determine the minimal substrate reactivity required for a target protein to be recognized and prenylated in the presence of endogenous levels of ftase fpp lipid donor cosubstrate and competing protein substrates within a living mammalian cell  by modifying the hypervariable region and the c -terminal sequence of a fluorescent fusion protein we have developed a series of reporter proteins whose reactivity with ftase is systematically varied over several orders of magnitude in combination these reporter proteins provide a calibrated sensor for probing endogenous ftase activity our methodology also provides a novel approach to detect changes in ftase activity within an intact cell in response to genomic mutations or environmental stimuli  quantitative determination of the threshold for prenylation within the cell will help define the extent of the prenylated proteome and aid in studying the prenylation-dependent pathways and the mechanism of therapeutics targeting the prenylation pathway
