vibrational circular dichroism near-infrared spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy new methodologies have been developed at the cutting-edge of fourier transform vibrational circular dichroism ft-vcd spectroscopy aimed at various pharmaceutical and biological applications vcd spectra of a series of proteins with different secondary structures were obtained with a modified  chiralir  biotools jupiter fl ft-vcd spectrometer in the near-infrared near-ir region from 6000 to 4000 cm -1  and the mid-infrared mid-ir region from 2000 to 800 cm -1   high quality mid-ir-vcd spectra were obtained to support accurate quantitative analysis based on vcd data the nir-vcd spectra of proteins show distinct spectral features for different protein structural motifs indicating a new valuable method to study protein structuresfor the first time vcd spectroscopy is applied to study the structures and associated formation dynamics of insulin and lysozyme proteins fibrils mid-ir vcd spectra show remarkable sensitivity to these protein fibrils which are -rich structural fibrils developed under the conditions of heating native protein solutions at low ph indicating that vcd is a powerful tool to study such complex systems in addition vcd shows successful results on monitoring the protein structural changes during fibrillation the potential for new insight into the mechanism and dynamics of the fibril formation process is elucidatedtwo-dimensional correlation vcd spectroscopy 2d-cos vcd is developed to enhance the applications of vcd the pd-dependence of the vcd and ir spectra of lalanine in d 2 o solution in the mid-ir ch-bending and ch-stretching regions and near-ir region are presented analysis of the 2d correlation plots provide further insight into the relative sensitivities of structural changes that take place in l-alanine as a function of pd near-ir band assignments are facilitated by hetero-spectral-region 2d-cos spectra that correlate the combination band region to that of the underling fundamental modes furthermore 2d cos vcd was applied to investigate structures of insulin fibrils during the formation process new insight into the functional groups associated with the fibrillation process is thereby obtainedenhanced vcd and magnetic vcd mvcd in transition metal complexes are presented similar to previous vcd results resonance-enhanced mvcd spectra are observed for a series of complexes with open-shell transition metals at coordination sites further confirming that the resonance enhancement comes from low-lying excited electronic states lless moreover regular mvcd are obtained from several complexes without lless suggesting a promising research method for structural determination of a wide range of moleculesthe structure of amylose tris-dimethylphenylcarbamate admpc and its conformational changes with respect to polar solvents were investigated by vcd for the first time by providing rich information on a number of different functional groups vcd was shown to be a powerful and innovative molecular-level probe to study the structures of this type of chiral polymer in addition the conformations of side chains and the backbone of admpc were monitored using vcd in the solid film state in the presence of different concentrations of alcohols vcd results revealed new insight into the behavior of admpc in the presence of these polar solvents when in combination with nonpolar solvents such as hexane
