waveguides anisotropic media this study is primarily concerned with the theoretical investigation of microwave cavities containing anisotropic media  an anisotropic medium in general is one characterized by a tensor permitivity and a tensor permeability which may be asymetric a major portion of this work is devoted to the calculation of the resonances of a rectangular cavity filled with anisotropic plasmas
