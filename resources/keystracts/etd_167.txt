computational electromagnetics computational methods fast algorithms fast methods method of moments numerical electromagnetics electromagnetic em solvers are widely used within computer-aided design cad to improve and ensure success of circuit designs unfortunately due to the complexity of maxwell's equations they are often computationally expensive while considerable progress has been made in the realm of speed-enhanced em solvers these fast solvers generally achieve their results through methods that introduce additional error components by way of geometric approximations sparse-matrix approximations multilevel decomposition of interactions and more this work introduces the new method unified-fft ufft a derivative of method of moments ufft scales as on log n and achieves fast analysis by the unique combination of fft-enhanced matrix fill operations mfo with fft-enhanced matrix solve operations msoin this work two versions of ufft are developed ufft-precorrected ufft-p and ufft-grid totalizing ufft-gt ufft-p uses precorrected fft for mso and allows the use of basis functions that do not conform to a regular grid ufft-gt uses conjugate gradient fft for mso and features the capability of reducing the error of the solution down to machine precision the main contribution of ufft-p is a fast solver which utilizes fft for both mfo and mso it is demonstrated in this work to not only provide simulation results for large problems considerably faster than state of the art commercial tools but also to be capable of simulating geometries which are too complex for conventional simulation in ufft-p these benefits come at the expense of a minor penalty to accuracyufft-gt contains further contributions as it demonstrates that such a fast solver can be accurate to numerical precision as compared to a full direct analysis it is shown to provide even more algorithmic efficiency and faster performance than ufft-p ufft-gt makes an additional contribution in that it is developed not only for planar geometries but also for the case of multilayered dielectrics and metallization this functionality is particularly useful for multi-layered printed circuit boards pcbs and integrated circuits ics finally ufft-gt contributes a 3d planar solver which allows for current to be discretized in the z-direction this allows for similar fast and accurate simulation with the inclusion of some 3d features such as vias connecting metallization planes
