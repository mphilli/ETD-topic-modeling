elasticity solution four-high mills contact load distribution mechanics most of the work in theory of rolling has been devoted and probably justifiably so to the study of the plastic deformation of the metal between the work rolls  relativly little has been done to analyze the problem of elastic contact between the work roll and back-up roll in the four-high rolling mill which has become the mainstay of the billion dollar industry of flat rollingthe elastic contact problem occurring in the four-high rolling mill is considered in this dissertation  it differs from the classical problems of cylinders in contact becasue of the accompanying bending deformations of the rolls
