 herein metallo-pyrophosphate complexes have been designed and synthesized in which pyrophosphate is chelated to multiple metals with an emphasis on cobalt and copper metal centers  these complexes have diverse and interesting behaviors ranging from cooperative magnetism to anti-mycobacterial propertiesthe latter application is one of the main focuses of this work investigating cobaltii and copperii pyrophosphate complexes as antibacterial agents  in particular a cobaltii pyrophosphate complex with an aromatic capping donor ligand has selectivity and potency against mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis tb  tb causes up to 10 million incident cases per year with an estimated annual death toll of two million  the need for innovative tb therapy has been stressed and this research has resulted in new lead compounds for the treatment of tb with a cobaltii pyrophosphate complex having activity comparable to current first-line tb therapyin addition to antibacterial agents the application of metallo-pyrophosphate complexes has been extended to the more complex eukaryotic fungus kingdom  species of candida are focused on as candida is the causative agent of common yeast infection and life-threatening candidemia which has high morbidity and mortality rates  cobaltii and copperii complexes were tested for activity against multiple clinical isolates from patients with active infection  varying degrees of efficacy have been discovered which could be assigned based on the particular clinical isolate and the particular metal center in different candida species  more in depth studies such as the activity in metal-transport protein knock-outs and efflux assays have also been conducted
