misuse of government positions public confidence in government conflict-of-interest reform the purpose of this dissertation is to examine the evolution of the executive branch program for the regulation of financial conflicts of interest in the federal service the problem of maintaining public confidence in the integrity of public officials is older than the twentieth century and the appearance of the administrative and regulatory states yet the unusual attention to the prevention of financial conflicts of interest in government as a major public policy issue is a recent phenomenon conflict-of-interest prevention has taken on unprecedented importance as a way to protect the impartiality of decision-making processes in governmentthe principal argument of the dissertation is that the failure to recognize the reasons for adopting conflict-of-interest prohibitions during the nineteenth century has distorted the development of the modern executive branch prevention program public policy arguments over conflict-of-interest prevention today--to tighten restrictions and to refine methods of identifying actual conflicts and the appearance of conflicts of interest--differ greatly from those of the nineteenth century the growing stress on regulation parallels the growing power of government to affect every aspect of american lifethe procedure of the dissertation is to make an historical analysis of the stages of conflict-of-interest reform and so to identify the forces--the roles played by congress by presidential administrations by representatives of public interest and professional groups and by the press--that contributed to a heightened awareness of financial conflicts of interest in american politicsthe term conflict of interest is used to designate a spectrum of prohibitions serving the symbolic purpose of deflecting charges of the misuse of government positions for personal financial gain and to dispel doubts of the impartiality of official action in this symbolic context wrongdoing is equated with weakening public confidence in governmentthe danger however is that concern over possible damage to public confidence tends to drive symbolic regulation beyond reason in terms of prohibited activities and penalties for violations then disruptions caused by unreasonably harsh provisions undermine the regulatory programthe major conclusion of the dissertation is that the undirected evolution of the executive branch prevention system explains in part the reluctance of proponents of regulation to go beyond the broad goal of safeguarding public confidence in government to clearly defined program objectivesfinally future conflict-of-interest reform to be productive must take into account the history of the executive branch conflict-of-interest prevention program
