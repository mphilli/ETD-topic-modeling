condensation single crystals of mercury cadmium telluride have been grown by two techniques solid state recrystallization and slush recrystallization each technique has been characterized by berg-barrett x-ray topography in order to determine optimum growth parameters optimum growth parameters for solid state recrystallized ingots of hg1-x cdxte were a quench rate of 50 lm a mercury partial pressure of 20 atm and an anneal temperature of 690c for slush recrystallization optimum growth of hg1-x cdxte crystals was achieved with initial compositions of 7 percent and a temperature gradient of 10ccm
