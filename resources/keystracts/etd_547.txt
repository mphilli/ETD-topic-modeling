biofilm quantum dots wound dressing it has been reported that wounds heal faster and better in a moist enclosed environment wound dressings are designed to fulfill such demands in addition wound dressings protect wounds from subsequent physical harm and bacterial infection among various types of wound dressings electrospun wound dressings are widely marketed due to desired properties for instance electrospun polymers are highly porous water and oxygen that are necessary for cells are permeable through the porous structure moreover electrospun polymers have high surface area to volume ratio this property allows polymers to absorb extra exudate from wounds efficiently  in this study several silver-releasing electrospun polymers were evaluated with respect to their inhibiting activities against bacterial biofilms additionally cadmium sulfide quantum dots were used as fluorescence probes to measure the silver release of several silver-containing polymers
