b mixing cp violation high energy physics semileptonic decays standard model the time-integrated measurement of the semileptonic cp violating asymmetry assl with data acquired at the large hadron collider with the lhcb experiment is presented this measurement can help physicists understand some peculiarities in the standard model which is the fundamental framework of knowledge of the universe should this asymmetry diverge from zero new physics may be a main motivator using 1 fb-1 of collected data in 2011 with proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 tev the measured value of assl presented is -006  050  036 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic this is in very good agreement with the standard model prediction of 0001900003 however divergent from the d0 collaboration measurement of -112  074  017
