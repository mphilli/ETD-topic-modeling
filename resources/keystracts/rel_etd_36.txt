aristotelian phainomena religion nussbaum martha macintyre alasdair moral philosophy this thesis takes as its starting-point g e m anscombe's argument in her 1958 essay entitled modern moral philosophy that contemporary ethics is largely incoherent due to the continuing use of moral concepts of obligation dependent upon a christian framework which no longer exists the origin of the current renaissance of aristotelian ethics is oftentimes traced to anscombe's recommendation that prechristian greek ethics might offer resources for the project of revisioning postchristian moral philosophy this dissertation investigates the contemporary turn to aristotle focusing on the aristotelian-informed moral theory of martha nussbaum and alasdair macintyre it does so in light of the continuous rather than discontinuous legacy of christian thought not just in terms of content and function but also with respect to the forms structures themes images narratives ethical presuppositions and literary genres employed in each theorist's work these are the phainomena  referred to in the title of this workthe central argument is that both nussbaum's and macintyre's appropriation and interpretation of aristotle are mediated and to a large extent shaped by their post christian location moreover despite the many overlapping areas of concern in their work eg the ethical significance of narrative practical reasoning and moral particularism i argue that the substantial differences in their respective framing of these issues can be explicated by exploring each in relation to religion and religious ethics this perspective serves to problematize both nussbaum's project of rehabilitating a prechristian aristotle and macintyre's advocacy of a christianized-aristotelian tradition
