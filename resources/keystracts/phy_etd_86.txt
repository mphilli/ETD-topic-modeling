crystalline screening approximation flat phase monte carlo surface science crystalline surfaces model important experimental and biological systems with the insight provided by theoretical analyses of the model we study the behavior of a crystalline surface in the flat phase using monte carlo simulations the flat phase is characterized by the anomalous scaling of the coupling constant we extract the scaling exponents from the finite size scaling of the correlation functions and we compare our results to the analytical predictions and to previous numerical determinations at bending rigidity \kappa11 we find \nu0955 hausdorff dimension d\sbh2\nu211\ \zeta0642 and \eta\sbu0501 these results are consistent with the scaling relation \zeta2\eta\sbu4 the additional scaling relation \eta21-\zeta implies \eta0724 a direct measurement of \eta from the power-law decay of the normal-normal correlation function yields \eta\approx06 on the 128\sp2 lattice we also measure the poisson ratio \sigma using a fluctuation-dissipation argument the precise numerical value we find is a \sigma\simeq-032 on a 128\sp2 lattice at bending rigidity \kappa11 this is in excellent agreement with the prediction \sigma-13 following from the self-consistent screening approximation of le doussal and radzihovsky finally we discuss some details of the monte carlo methods
