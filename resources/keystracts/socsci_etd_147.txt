behavior thought patterns the following study is an introductory description of typical behavior and thought patterns of individuals at the woodcrest bruderhof i have felt my primary obligation in this work to be expository there is little attempt here to compare the bruderhof with other intentional communities although the community's intimate relations with the other bruderhoefe of course are discussed second in importance at this stage i place the social and moral implications of the study theoretical considerations finally are barely touched upon because not only is a satisfactory framework for such analysis not available but i feel that 49 days of observation -- even supplemented by documentary work -- do not constitute an adequate basis for far reaching scientific generalizations
