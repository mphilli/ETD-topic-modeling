carbon monoxide  palladium111 copper co adsorption and oxidation on ultra thin cu covered epitaxial pd111 thin film surfaces have been investigatedauger electron spectroscopy aes and low energy electron diffraction leed were used to determine the growth mode of cu overlayers on pd111 the results show that cu grows on pd111 by a layer mode of growth ie a second layer starts growing only after the first layer is completed and so on a 1 x 1 leed pattern was observed with increasing cu thickness indicating an epitaxial overlayer growth the cu overlayer on pd111 has the bulk lattice parameter when it is 5 monolayers ml thickthe co adsorption kinetics on pd111 and cu covered pd111 were studied by a work function change method and thermal desorption spectroscopy tds the co adsorption mechanism on epitaxial thin pd111 films and on cupd111 bilayers follows the kisliuk first-order precursor model it was also shown that thin cu overlayers had a drastic effect on saturation co coverage results indicate that the reactivity of a thin cu overlayer on pd111 involves substrate-induced effects experiments showed that co adsorption takes place in two steps the high energy sites \beta\sb2 are filled first during early exposure and then one or more low energy sites are filled to saturation co adsorption on cu111pd111 bilayers occurs in decreasing amounts as the cu overlayer thickensthe difference in the saturation co coverage measured by tds and wf methods indicates the existence of weakly adsorbed co molecules on these surfaces the fraction of weakly adsorbed co was a maximum for a 12 ml cupd111co oxidation experiments showed that the co\sb2 formation rate with respect to copperless pd111 was a maximum for an epitaxial 12 ml cu on pd111 bilayer the rate decreases with thicker cu films up to 3 ml when the cu is 3 ml thick there is another smaller increase in the rate the rate saturates at 5 ml cu these results were discussed in terms of weakly adsorbed co on the reactivity of these catalytic surfaces and also changes in surface morphology and microstructure during growth of the cu overlayer
