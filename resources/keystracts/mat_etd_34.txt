preprojective component admissible sequences finite-dimensional algebras quiver for a finite quiver without oriented cycles we study the set of -admissible sequences as introduced in [bgp] we show how the nonisomorphic indecomposable preprojective modules can be characterized in terms of -admissible sequences and establish a connection with the classical characterization presented for example in [ars]
