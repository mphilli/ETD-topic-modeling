materials science condensation this dissertation summarizes the effects of doping of boron carbide materials hydrogen nickel and phosphorus were doped into boron carbideboron carbide fabricated by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd contains hydrogen and reduction of the hydrogen content appears to reduce the band gap the hydrogenated boron carbide was found to have very high resistivity \sim10\sp7 to 10\sp10\ \omega-cm with the high resistivity form of the material boron carbide b\sb5cboronsilicon multilayer heterojunction devices were fabricatednickel doped boron carbide films were grown on n-si111 substrates to construct diodes and tunnel diodes the source gas closo-12-dicarbadodecaborane orthocarborane-\rm c\sb2b\sb10h\sb12 was used to grow the boron carbide while nickelocene nic\rm\sb5h\sb5\sb2 was used to introduce nickel into the growing film the doping of nickel transformed a rhombohedral b\sb5c material p-type relative to lightly doped n-type silicon to a strongly n-type material in addition it is possible to construct a p - n homojunction boron carbide b\sb5c diode this homojunction diode exhibits excellent i - v characteristics not only at room temperature but also at higher temperatures 573 k moreover with sufficient partial pressures of nickelocene in the plasma reactor diodes with characteristic tunnel diode behavior can be made these results suggest that ni doping populates states in the gap which are pinned to one band edge conduction bandfrom the gas phase of a singe source compound dimeric chloro-phosphaiii carborane \rmc\sb2b\sb10h\sb10\sb2pcl\sb2 phosphorus doped boron carbide films were made phosphorus doped b\sb5c materials increased the band gap from 09 ev to 26 ev
