emotion categories fine-grained emotion classification machine learning microblog text sentiment analysis twitter automatic emotion detection in text is concerned with using natural language processing techniques to recognize emotions expressed in written discourse endowing computers with the ability to recognize emotions in a particular kind of text microblogs has important applications in sentiment analysis and affective computing in order to build computational models that can recognize the emotions represented in tweets we need to identify a set of suitable emotion categories prior work has mainly focused on building computational models for only a small set of six basic emotions happiness sadness fear anger disgust and surprise this thesis describes a taxonomy of 28 emotion categories an expansion of these six basic emotions developed inductively from data this set of 28 emotion categories represents a set of fine-grained emotion categories that are representative of the range of emotions expressed in tweets microblog posts on twitterthe ability of humans to recognize these fine-grained emotion categories is characterized using inter-annotator reliability measures based on annotations provided by expert and novice annotators a set of 15553 human-annotated tweets form a gold standard corpus emotweet-28 for each emotion category we have extracted a set of linguistic cues ie punctuation marks emoticons emojis abbreviated forms interjections lemmas hashtags and collocations that can serve as salient indicators for that emotion categorywe evaluated the performance of automatic classification techniques on the set of 28 emotion categories through a series of experiments using several classifier and feature combinations our results shows that it is feasible to extend machine learning classification to fine-grained emotion detection in tweets ie as many as 28 emotion categories with results that are comparable to state-of-the-art classifiers that detect six to eight basic emotions in text classifiers using features extracted from the linguistic cues associated with each category equal or better the performance of conventional corpus-based and lexicon-based features for fine-grained emotion classificationthis thesis makes an important theoretical contribution in the development of a taxonomy of emotion in text in addition this research also makes several practical contributions particularly in the creation of language resources ie corpus and lexicon and machine learning models for fine-grained emotion detection in text
