binomial ranking curtailment least-favorable configuration in this thesis we consider the problem of selecting the best among several experimental treatments in comparison to a control treatment under the binomial setting the goal is to select the experimental treatment that produces the largest value of the probability of getting a success in a single trial when this probability is better than the one corresponding to the control population otherwise we select the control treatmentwe propose selection procedures based on the single-stage procedure defined by dunnett 1984 and the hybrid selection and testing procedure defined by thall et al1988 our procedures are exact that is they are based on the binomial distribution only as opposed to most of the original procedures that involve the normal approximation to the binomial we evaluate the probability of a correct selection pcs for our procedures exactly and then derive the least favorable configurations lfc with our results on the lfc the redefined procedures can be applied to any sample sizebased on the fixed sample size procedure proposed by sobel and hyuett 1957 with the desire of minimizing the number of observations taken from the poorer populations bechoffer and kulkarni 1982 proposed a sequential procedure which achieves the same probability of a correct selection as does the sobel-hyuett procedure but requires fewer observations along the same lines but based on dunnett's fixed-sample-size procedure 1984 where a control is involved we have used strong curtailment to define a procedure which requires fewer observations from the experimental treatments and from the control but achieves the same probability of a correct selection as does dunnett's procedure then based on thall et al's two-stage design 1988 we use strong curtailment again to define a hybrid selecting and testing design which reaches the same probability of a correct selection as the original design but requires fewer observations
