image perturbations watermarking variational calculus the area of digital watermarking although relatively new is well established in the field of image processing and computer engineering it has developed rapidly over the past decade and many different watermarking algorithms as well as sophisticated methods of testing their reliability have been proposedan original watermarking method in the image domain formulated mathematically is introduced as a variational minimization problem with randomly generated boundary constraints the properties of this method regarding detection and invariance are proved using results from calculus of variations pdes as well as modern image analysisthe method is implemented numerically using the finite element method on a uniform triangulation of the unit square computational details are provided for the case of non-homogeneous boundary conditions results regarding the smoothness of the solution for convex domains and the convergence order of the method are proventwo classes of experiments are designed and implemented in matlab   the class supports the original claims of unobtrusiveness detectability and invariance of the perturbation introduced through our method the second class compares several features of our method to those of the wavelet-projection method proposed in [16] these features are detection of the watermarks in both image and wavelet domain invariance and robustness of the watermarks to blurring and resizing pertinent images and graphs are included as well as the original matlab  code
