aminoglycoside packaging region hiv-1 rna immune deficiency the  region of hiv-1 spans 200 nucleotides nt near the 5 ' end of the rna genome this region has been shown to play a significant role in encapsidation and transciptional regulation of the viral rna as a result the  region has the potential to be a target for drugs in this study a 176 nt model lai strain of the  region representing positions 213-388 was investigated with natural aminoglycosides paromomycin and neomycin and modified analogues of neomycin neo-neo neo-acridine and neo-guanidinium using footprinting and circular dichroism cd techniques footprinting analysis was conducted using the ribonuclease rnase i under optimized single-hit kinetic cutting conditions intensity data obtained from autogradiograms was used to generate a collection of footprinting plots for each drug analysis of the footprinting plots revealed a primary binding site at sl1 for paromomycin and neomycin with a binding constant of 45  10 5 m -1 at 25c in 10 mm tris-hcl ph 75 for neomycin analysis of the footprinting plots for neo-acridine and neo-guanidinium also indicated a primary binding site on sl1 having binding constants of 34  10 5 m -1 and 22  10 5 m -1 for each drug respectively both neo-acridine and neo-guanidinium also interacted with sites on sl2 and sl4 neo-neo footprinting analysis indicated a single primary binding site on sl2 possibly formed by an intermolecular binding pocket with a binding constant of 25  10 5 m -1  at non-binding sites each drug produced footprinting plots having an increase in intensity at high drug concentrations such effects are a result of structural changes predominately found in the linker regions of the rna using circular dichroism the global effects of drug-induced structural change of the 176-mer rna was measured for each drug analysis of plots of cd versus drug concentration revealed an increase in intensity for neomycin paromomycin and neo-guanidinium at 208 nm and a slight red shift with no intensity change at the same wavelength for neo-neo and neo-acridine in the drug concentration range of 11 to 20 m a decrease in the intensity of the 266 nm band was observed for all the drugs except paromomycin the intensity changes observed for the 208 nm band are associated with the structural changes in the linker region by plotting the change in extinction coefficient against drug concentration cd derived binding constants were calculated for each drug results indicated that several binding sites were responsible for the structural changes measured in the cd analysis this study demonstrates how footprinting and cd methods can be used to identify drug binding sites and drug-induced structural changes associated with drug binding to a large rna target
