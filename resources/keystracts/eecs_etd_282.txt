operations research software systems continued increase in the complexity and use of computer systems in a wide variety of applications has necessitated a greater emphasis on the development of cost-effective and reliable software  this has led to the evolutin of a new discipline called software engineering in this dissertation we are concerned with the development of stochastic models for the software failure process under imperfect debugging or maintenance
