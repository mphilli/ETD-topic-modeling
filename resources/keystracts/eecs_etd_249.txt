array expressions shapes the ability to describe array expressions in terms of the shapes of their arguments and the symbolic verification of n-dimensional array expressions has been an open area of research in theoretical computer science a class of operations which includes the inner and outer product of array expressions is defined using shapes an indexing function \psi is the basis of all definitions while a higher order operation \omega extends the operations to apply to any dimension the theory presented is followed by an application to hardware design verification progress on the formal design implementation and verification of a basis for a parallel language with arrays including the scheduling of subarray operations asynchronous events to the processors of shared-memory mimd architectures is discussed
