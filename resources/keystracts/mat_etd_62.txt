cluster tilted algebra complexity finite-dimensional algebra tilting theory trivial extension in this thesis we study two types of complexity of modules over  finite-dimensional algebrasin the first part we examine the -complexity of a  family of self-injective k-algebras where k is an algebraically closed field and   is the syzygy operator more precisely let t be the trivial  extension of an iterated tilted algebra of type h we prove that modules over  the trivial extension t all have complexities either 0 1 2 or infinity  depending on the representation type of the hereditary algebra h as part of the  proof we show that a stable equivalence between self-injective algebras  preserves the complexity of modulesin the second part we study the -complexity of modules  over cluster tilted algebras where  is the auslander-reiten translate  we prove that modules over the cluster tilted algebra of type h all have  complexities either 0 1 2 or infinity depending on the representation type of  the hereditary algebra h
