degenerate elliptic partial differential partial differential equations in this thesis two types of second order elliptic partial differential equations will be studied the first type is the following equation [special characters omitted] for a function u  of sobolev class [special characters omitted] here a b  and c  are measurable functions on  with a   0 c   0 and  ac  - b    0 ae  our main result will be that u is of class c 1  provided that [special characters omitted] is locally integrable on the second equation we will study is the non-homogeneous p -harmonic equation [special characters omitted] for a function [special characters omitted] where [special characters omitted] with [special characters omitted] our main result is the followingtheorem let u be a non-homogeneous p -harmonic function on [special characters omitted] of class [special characters omitted] where 1  p  2 if [special characters omitted] then [special characters omitted] and the following uniform estimate holds [special characters omitted]among other applications this theorem will be used to establish higher integrability of  u
