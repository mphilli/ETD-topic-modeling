protein phosphatase 2a holoenzymes cell cycle protein phosphatase 2a pp2a regulates a broad spectrum of cellular processes this holoenzyme is a collection of varied heterotrimeric complexes composed of a catalytic c and regulatory b subunit bound together by a structural a subunitto understand the cell cycle dynamics of this enzyme population we carried out quantitative and qualitative analyses of pp2a subunits in saccharomyces cerevisiae  we found the level of each subunit remained constant throughout the cell-cycle there is at least ten times more of one of the regulatory subunits rts1p than the other cdc55p tpd3p the structural subunit is limiting for both catalytic and regulatory subunit binding the two regulatory subunits display distinctly different dynamic localization patterns that overlap with the a and c subunits at the bud tip kinetochore bud neck and nucleus using strains null for single subunit genes we confirmed the hypothesis that regulatory subunits determine sites of pp2a accumulation additionally we identified some cis- and trans-acting machinery involved in pp2a cdc55p and pp2a rts1p localizationsin vitro binding assays demonstrated that c subunit post-translational modifications affects pp2a heterotrimer stabilities however the degree to which different types of heterotrimers are affected in vivo unknown using subunit localization to assess in vivo binding stabilities we found that pph21p c-terminal mutants that are not efficiently modified and cells lacking the c subunit's methyltransferase ppm1  both show reduced pp2a localization presumably because the formation of stable pp2a heterotrimers is decreased furthermore cdc55p-directed pp2a localizations are reduced to a greater degree than rts1p-directed localizations thus the formation of stable pp2a heterotrimers is dependent on c subunit modification and pp2a cdc55p stability is more dependent on this than is pp2a rtrs1p in vitro data also suggest that specific regions of the a subunit are necessary for heterotrimer formation however there is little to no in vivo data to support this finding thus we determined the role of various a subunit regions in in vivo heterotrimeric makeup overall we found that pp2a heterotrimers are more stable in vivo than they are in vitro  using pp2a mutant phenotypes we found that pp2a rts1p is more resistant to a subunit mutations than is pp2a cdc55p
