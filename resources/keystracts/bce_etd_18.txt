ligninolytic manganese peroxidase biobleaching white-rot fungus manganese peroxidase mnp is a heme containing enzyme produced by white-rot fungi for the degradation of lignin in wood this enzyme has potential applications in the biobleaching of wood pulp as an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical bleaching methods to increase production of mnp above levels achievable with the native white-rot fungus the mnp1  gene encoding mnp has been cloned into the yeast pichia pastoris   research is reported here on the production of recombinant mnp rmnp using shake flask and bench scale fermentors and on the purification and concentration of the rmnp for use in pulp bleaching experimentsactive recombinant mnp rmnp could be produced in shake-flasks provided the ph was maintained between 6 and 7 at lower ph no active enzyme was produced even though the yeast cells grew at the same rate down to ph 4 use of protease inhibitors or a protease deficient strain did not appear to increase the concentration of rmnp produced below ph 6 and no increase in rmnp concentrations in fermentations at ph 6 resulted from addition of casamino acids or peptone as protease competitive inhibitors use of pure o 2 to reduce agitation speed and release of proteases via cell lysis and production at a lower temperature to decrease protease activity amendment of the medium with heme 01 to 1 gl increased the concentration of rmnpthe rmnp concentration was increased from approximately 100 molesminl in shake flasks to greater than 3000 molesminl in the fermentors using a protease deficient p pastoris strain  p pastoris mp 1-1 containing the mnp1 gene with a constitutive glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pgap promoter and yeast secretion signal a batch and fed-batch approach was employed with a basal salts medium and glucose as the carbon source heme was added at the beginning of fed-batch batch and fed-batch cultivation using glucose as the growth substrate was modeled and the kinetic parameters were determined the model predictions agree well with the experimental datadue to the low aqueous solubility of heme it formed a fine dispersion in the medium to separate the rmnp from the medium and concentrate the enzyme centrifugation 10000x g  5 minutes was employed to remove the yeast cells and the heme and then the enzyme was precipitated using acetone approximately 75 of the rmnp could be precipitated and recovered using 40 acetone and the enzyme concentrate was found to be of adequate purity and concentration for use in pulp bleaching experiments
