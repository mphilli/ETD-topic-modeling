speech sound disorders ultrasound treatment visual feedback purpose  the purpose of this study was to provide an initial comparison of exposure to ultrasound visual feedback of the tongue and no exposure to ultrasound in speech therapy for postvocalic rhotics the r family of sounds  effects of the two treatments on acquisition retention and generalization were explored in participants ages 7-9methods  a single-subject randomized block design replicated across four participants was used  each week for seven weeks one session containing high frequency ultrasound use and one session containing no ultrasound use were randomly ordered  a training probe list and generalization probe list consisting of monosyllabic words multisyllabic words phrases and short sentences were used to measure acquisition within each session as well as retention and generalization between two consecutive sessions  data analyses included a descriptive statistics to complement visual inspections of single-subject graphs b effect size calculation and c statistical results from a randomization testresults one participant showed a significant advantage for ultrasound sessions over no ultrasound sessions in acquisition scores however there were no differences between treatment conditions for any participants in generalization or retentionconclusion for some children acquisition may be facilitated by ultrasound visual feedback  no evidence suggested that ultrasound visual feedback inhibited retention or generalization in speech tasks  as a whole treatment was effective for 2 of the 4 participants when comparing prepost generalization data  future studies should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of ultrasound visual feedback therapy given a larger dose ie treatment duration and differing age groups
