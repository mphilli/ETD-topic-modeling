exclusion special sciences philosophy of mind metaphysics mental causation overdetermination the causal efficacy of special science properties is put in doubt given that all of macro-reality supervenes on microphysics and microphysics is causally closed if special science properties like mental properties are causally efficacious then they appear to be causally redundant i consider this causal overdetermination worry for psychology in particularsuch causal overdetermination has been widely acknowledged as uniformly problematic however i distinguish among three types of causal overdetermination and argue that they are problematic for distinct reasons the overdetermination worry for the special sciences is different from the paradigmatic overdetermination worries frequently citedthe special science overdetermination worry is a serious metaphysical problem a solution to this problem would take one of two forms first the special science causes could be identified with microphysical causes or second the special sciences and microphysics could be shown to have distinct effectsafter arguing that property instances or tropes are the causal relata  i consider the possibility of a mental-physical trope identification while distinct property types can share an instance trope when related as determinable to determinate i argue that mental properties are not related to any physical properties as such on the trope individuation conditions i offer mental causes are not identical to physical causesstill the second approach could succeed and save the special sciences from causal exclusion indeed i argue that just as mental causes are distinct from physical causes their effects are distinct as well the trope theory i advocate provides a metaphysical justification for the non-reductionist's stratified picture of the sciences
