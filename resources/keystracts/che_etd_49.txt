epothilone a natural products wittig rearrangement-[2 3] the goal of this work was the total synthesis of the promising antitumor candidate epothilone a recent work in our laboratories has focused on the use of stereocontrolled sigmatropic reactions for the construction of complex polyketide-derived natural products particularly useful for the elaboration of polypropionate systems is the [23] wittig rearrangement of tertiary allylic ethers which generates stereodefined trisubstituted olefinsour approach to the epothilones focused on the development of the c1-c12 subunit of the parent macrolide using the stabilized [23] wittig rearrangement was unique in that the c-3 hydroxyl stereochemistry was to be installed not through a stereoselective reduction of a carbonyl group but via the [23] wittig rearrangement the [23] wittig rearrangement of our epothilone a tertiary allylic ether intermediate produced trans olefin selectivity with low stereoselectivity observed at c-3the introduction of stereochemistry at c-6 was to be accomplished by stereoselective hydroboration of the trisubstituted trans olefin generated by [23] wittig rearrangement chemistry developed in this regard will find direct application to the synthesis of other biologically significant polyketide systems however attempts to investigate the stereoselective hydroboration of the stabilized [23] wittig rearrangement product were unsuccessful
