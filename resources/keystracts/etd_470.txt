 bacteria can form antibiotic tolerant dormant variants known as persister cells and complex multicellular structures of biofilms with microbial cells attached to surfaces such mechanisms lead to hundreds to thousands times higher tolerance to antimicrobials with the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and lack of new antibiotics developing alternative therapies to combat antibiotic resistant pathogens have become an urgency in modern medicinein this study we aimed to develop a new inhibitory strategy for persister control using chitosan based nnn-trimethyl chitosan tmc  polysialic acid psa nanoparticles using pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 as a model species tmc-psa nanoparticles nps were found to effectively reduce the persistence level of p aeruginosa pao1 both in planktonic populations and in biofilmsz-4-bromo-5-bromomethylene-3-methylfuran- 25h-one bf8 is a synthetic brominated furanone with strong activities against bacterial quorum sensing it can reduce persister formation during bacterial growth including that in biofilm and sensitize isolated persisters to antibiotics to further develop bf8 based control methods we encapsulated bf8 into tmc-psa nanoparticles evaluated bf8 release and tested inhibitory effects of bf8 encapsulated nanoparticles bfnps on bacterial persistence the inhibitory effects of both nps and bfnps on p aeruginosa pao1 persistence were found to increase with the concentration of nps and the inhibitory activities of nps and bfnps were found to increase as ph decreased collectively tmc-psa nanoparticles exhibited potent inhibition of p aeruginosa pao1 persistence and are potential drug carrier system for bf8
