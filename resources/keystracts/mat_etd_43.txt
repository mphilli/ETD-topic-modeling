g-cell complexes equivariant cohomology it is well known that the cohomology of a finite cw-complex with cells only in even dimensions is free the equivariant analog of this result for generalized g -cell complexes is however not obvious since ro  g -graded cohomology cannot be computed using cellular chains we consider g  [special characters omitted]  p and study g -spaces that can be built as cell complexes using the unit disks of finite dimensional g -representations as cells our main result is that if x is a g -complex containing only even dimensional representation cells and satisfying certain finite type assumptions then the ro  g -graded equivariant ordinary cohomology is free as a graded module over the cohomology of a point this extends a result due to gaunce lewis about equivariant complex projective spaces with linear [special characters omitted]  p actions our new result applies more generally to equivariant complex grassmannians with linear [special characters omitted]  p actions
