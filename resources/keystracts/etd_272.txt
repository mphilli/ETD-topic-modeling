android app description malware detection privacy leakage security vulnerability patching as usage of the android applications has grown security concerns have also increasedfour major threats have attracted attention malicious apps have been increasingly exponentially android malware steals and pollutes sensitive information executes attacker specified commands or even totally roots and subverts the mobile devices moreover a significant amount of recently discoveredmalware samples are polymorphic malware variants and zero-day malware new malware instances can easily exercise bytecode-level obfuscation to evade existing av scannersa broad spectrum of software vulnerabilities have been discovered in android apps attackers can exploit vulnerable programs to launch various attacks on their behalf static analysis is used to detect vulnerabilities but introduces significant false alarms an automated technique is needed to efficiently patch the victim apps and precisely defeat exploitationsinformation leakage is prevailing in both malware and benign applications some information leaks are legitimate due to the essential app functionalities whereas others are undesirable or even malicious it is thus extremely difficult to accurately and efficiently track information leaks and at the same time effectively disable the undesired onesthe textual description of app products in android markets act as the frontline protection and help users to recognize malicious or unwanted programs thus the fact that android app descriptions cannot faithfully reflect the security risks imperils end usersandroid permissions are not only hard to understand but also incapable of explaining how the requested permissions are used textual descriptions provided by developers are not security-centric or trustworthythis dissertation addresses these problems by presenting concepts methods and techniques that can be used to robustly detect malware automatically patch vulnerabilities efficiently protect privacy and effectively help users to understand the risks of mobile appsfirstly droidsift is proposed and developed to perform semantics-aware android malware detection and classification it extracts high-level program behavior graphs as features and captures homogeneous behaviors via measuring graph similarities thus the subsequent classification is resilient to bytecode-level obfuscation and can detect malware variants and zero-day malwaresecondly appsealer is presented to automatically patch component hijacking vulnerabilities in android programs it selectively inserts patch code into vulnerable programs and monitors the exact program slices that lead to potential exploitations the patch code only introduces necessary intervention when an attack is about to launch therefore this patch-based solution has minimal impact on the usability but gains time for the developers to bring the fundamental fixthirdly capper is introduced to enforce context-aware privacy policies for android apps without compromising legitimate functionalities it rewrites privacy breaching apps by inserting code that tracks sensitive information flow and enforces privacy polices the policies are specific to program contexts and are created via modeling the user reaction to each privacy incident at runtimelastly describeme is proposed and developed to automatically generate security-centric descriptions for android applications it retrieves security-related program semantics from android apps and translates them into natural language scripts to facilitate the translation it also performs frequent behavior mining to discover and compress common semantics as a result the produced descriptions are security-sensitive human-understandable and concise
