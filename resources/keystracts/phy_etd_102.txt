radiation electrodynamics compton scattering this study attempts to contribute to the differentiation of theoretical assumptions by representing charged particles spin zero by wave packets of volkov solutions and by representing the external field by a finite length pulse the more general goal of this paper is the development of a formalism which can be applied to any quantum electrodynamic process involving a charged particle in a laser pulse--page 2
