drug delivery micelles nanoparticles polysaccharides rheumatoid arthritis the field of drug delivery has provided a solution to the limited efficacy and high toxicity of many drugs nano-sized drug carriers are popular because their size allows for selective accumulation in the diseased area polysaccharides are non-toxic and biodegradable natural polymers that can serve as the basis for these nano-sized carriers polysialic acid psa is such a polysaccharide with strong hydrophilicity that may reduce uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and prolong drug circulation in this study we developed psa-based nanocarriers specifically micelles and nanoparticles for improved drug delivery with improved efficacy and minimized toxicity psa-based micelle systems were developed via conjugation with two hydrophobic groups decylamine da and polycaprolactone pcl nanoparticles were fabricated via ionic complexation of the negatively charged psa with positively charged n n n-trimethyl chitosan tmc all three nanocarriers possessed sizes close to 100 nm with low polydispersity pdi and high zeta potential values literature suggested that these characteristics would allow the nanocarriers to be physiologically stable and would facilitate passive accumulation within diseased areas rheumatoid arthritis ra was selected as the primary disease model for evaluation of our nanocarriers psa-pcl micelles and psa-tmc nanoparticles showed low cytotoxicity as demonstrated by high ic50 values psa-pcl 105  17 mgml psa-tmc 765  007 mgml to synovial cells the so-called conductors of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis the synovial cells were also used to demonstrate effective uptake of fluorescently tagged nanocarriers three disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs dmards were selected for loading into the nanocarriers cyclosporine a cya was encapsulated within the psa-pcl micelles while methotrexate mtx and dexamethasone dm were entrapped within the psa-tmc nanoparticles psa-pcl micelles were loaded with 009  002 mg cya per mg of psa- pcl while psa-tmc nanoparticles were loaded with 010  003 mg mtx and 010  002 mg dm per mg of psa-tmc controlled release of the dmards from the nanocarriers was demonstrated an in vitro model of rheumatoid arthritis was used to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory nature of the mtx- and dm-loaded psa-tmc nanoparticles to the author's knowledge this is the first time that psa-based nanocarriers were successfully developed and evaluated for improved drug delivery
