adsorption desorption surfaces atomic beam scattering astrophysics molecular hydrogen formation in the interstellar medium is one of the most relevant perhaps the most relevant problem of astrophysics being the most abundant molecule molecular hydrogen enters or triggers virtually all molecule-formation schemes in space many of these reactions occur in the gas phase with participation of ions catalytic reactions involving hydrogen and heavier species take place on surfaces of dust particles in the extreme conditions of several astrophysical environments up to now most investigations of surface catalysis have been carried out only on materials and in temperature ranges that are not of great relevance to space applicationsthis thesis describes how surface science tools can be employed to study physical processes leading to formation of molecules at surfaces under astrophysically relevant conditions an experiment has been carried out in our laboratory to investigate key reactions between gas-phase particles and atomsmolecules adsorbed on surfaces of dust grain analogues graphite silicate etc by using molecular beam methods and surface science techniques an apparatus to study key reactions on low temperature surfaces is described in detail as well as measurement procedures and some results of astrophysical relevancewe report on experimental investigations of hd production on low temperature surfaces of silicates under conditions relevant to hydrogen recombination on dust grain surfaces in the interstellar medium following adsorption of h and d at thermal energies on a silicate surface olivine in the 5-15 k range flash desorption experiments were conducted to yield desorption energies and order of desorption kinetics we find that significant recombination occurs only at the lowest temperatureson the basis of our experimental evidence our measurements give lower values for the recombination efficiency sticking probability s times the probability of recombination upon h-h encounter \gamma than model-based estimates we propose that our results can be reconciled with average estimates of the recombination rate 1\over2n\sbhn\sbgv\sbhas\sb\gamma from astronomical observations if the actual surface of average grain is rougher and its area bigger than the one considered in models
