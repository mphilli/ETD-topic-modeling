 let w pi be a riemann domain over a complex manifold m and w0 be a point in w let d be the unit disk in the complex plane and t be the unit circle consider the space s1w0 dwm of continuous mappings f of t into w such that f1w0 and pi circ f extends to a holomorphic mapping hat f on d mappings f0 f1 in s1w0 d w m are called holomorphically homotopic or h-homotopic if there is a continuous mapping ft of [01] into s1w0d w m clearly the h-homotopy is an equivalence relation and the equivalence class of f in s1w0d w m will be denoted by [f] and the set of all equivalence classes by 1w m w0there is a natural mapping iota1 1w m w0 to pi1w w0 generated by assigning to f in s1w0d w m its restriction to t we introduce on 1w m w0 a binary operation  which induces on 1w m w0 a structure of a semigroup with unity and show that 1w m w0 is an algebraic biholomorphic invariant of riemann domains moreover iota1[f1]  [f2]  iota1 [f1] cdot iota1 [f2] where cdot is the standard operation on pi1w w0 then we establish standard properties of 1w m w0 and provide some examples when w is a finitely connected domain in the complex plane and pi is the identity we show that iota1 is an isomorphism of 1w m w0 onto the minimal subsemigroup of pi1w w0 containing some specific generators and invariant with respect to the inner automorphisms for a general domain w in the complex plane we prove that [f1][f2] if and only if iota1[f1]  iota_1[f2] which is the manifestation of the homotopic oka principle
