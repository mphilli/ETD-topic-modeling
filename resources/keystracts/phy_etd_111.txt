atp ciliary motility electric field frequncy response red light signaling pathway the goal of this dissertation is to understand how a eukaryotic  cell makes decisions chlamydomonas reinhardtii a  biciliated unicellular green alga is used as our model organism this organism  has the ability to track the light using its photoreceptor called rhodopsin  which overlays the eyespot the organism makes decisions to swim toward away  from perpendicular to or to ignore the light using its slender arm-like  structures called cilia it can integrate several external inputs such as ion  concentration and light intensity and then process this information to adjust  the steering of its cilia corresponding to its environment    we investigated how red light 670 nm influences cell behavior most  studies were done with a single cell held on a micropipette making it possible  to observe the cilia behavior over a long time the cell is illuminated with  near-infrared light peak at 870 nm to avoid photoreceptor excitation ciliary  movement is monitored using a quadrant photodiode detector chapter 2  interpreted ciliary behavior parameters are the beating frequency bf and the  stroke velocity sv pulse stimuli were used to stimulate the mutant strain  806 agg1 a  negatively phototactic cell whose beating frequency is in the same range as  wild type the step-up red light from the dark increases the beating frequency  as an exponential function yt  a[1-exp-tb] where y is a beating  frequency a is an amplitude and b is a time constant on the other hand the  step-down red light drops the beating frequency transiently and recovers to  its normal beating frequency of about 50 hz in about 10 s the 40 s duration  pulse gave the maximum transient drop of the beating frequency using  multi-sinusoidal red-light stimuli i compared the behavior of the double mutant  cpc1-2 relative to the single mutant  806 cpc1-2 was  backcrossed to strain 806 so it is a single mutant  with respect to 806 the mutant misses the part of  the central-pair complex containing the enolase enzyme one of the ciliary  glycolytic enzymes that produces atp in the cilia under a high  constant-intensity of red light the bf fluctuation is less than 2 in the  dark bf of cpc1-2 is about 30 hz which is lower  than 806 probably due to less atp being available  however bf can be increased to the 806 level of 50  hz by exposure to red light a simple hypothesis is that red-light  photosynthesis of the chloroplast makes atp more available in the cell in any  case sinusoidal red-light response of cpc1-2 shows  that part of the early signal processing is approximately linear in this case  cells respond to a decrease in light intensity by differentiating the red light  signal our hypothesis is that the cell creates this signal to avoid futile  usage of atp the transfer function describing this step is gs   asexp-s where   040 sec in addition to this linear part  both strains have non-linear or approximately full-wave rectified signal  processing of another red light created signal with a simple delay in time  described by the transfer function gs   aexp-strains where  806  118 sec and  cpc1-2  037 sec the longer delay time of  806 is likely due to the slow conversion of  3-phosphoglycerate 3pg to adenosine triphosphate atp in the glycolytic  pathway which is absent in the mutant we hypothesize that the slow synthesis  is due to the positive gibbs free energy of two steps in the ciliary glycolytic  pathway between 3pg and production of atp and pyruvate furthermore the beating  frequency of red-light sinusoidal responses is stabilized by negative feedback  however in the frequency range from 10 to 100 hz in both strains that  stabilizing negative feedback becomes positive and the bf jumps to a new  state    in addition i also studied how external ion concentration such as  ca2 h and  k and red light affect phototaxis of positively and  negatively-phototactic cells 1117 and  806 respectively i have tracked a cell population  using the cell-tracking system for 10 s after stimulating them with green light  chapter 4 increasing  [ca2]ext with a red light  background enhances the motion of cells in the same and the opposite direction  respectively according to cells' phototactic behavior under normal condition  pca4 and ph 68 increasing the ph tends to induce cells to move away from the  light while increasing the  [k]ext gave the opposite  results changing external ion concentration such as  h and k affects the  cell's membrane potential changing ca2  concentration affects both membrane potential and likely triggers internal  signaling proteins such as ip3 and camp therefore we  hypothesize that cells may integrate these and potentially other signals to  decide its phototaxis    finally i developed a technique that can be used to measure changes of  the electric field across the plasma membrane of the cell in response to  rhodopsin excitation rhodopsin excitation is thought to cause transmembrane ion  influxes resulting in changes in the electric field across the plasma membrane  these electric field signals are then sensed in the cilia to enable phototactic  steering of the cell chapter 5
