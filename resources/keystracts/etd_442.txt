all-solid-state lithium ion battery interfacial resistance multilayer composite electrolyte solid electrolyte lithium ion batteries libs are becoming the standard energy storage option for an increasingly diverse range of applications from mobile phones to cars the conventional liquid electrolytes based libs are prone to failure in conditions such as high operating temperature solvent leakage lithium dendrites formation and thermal runaway etc all-solid-state lithium ion batteries asslibs provide a promising power strategy to overcome the drawbacks of liquid electrolyte by substituting the highly flammable organic liquid electrolyte with solid electrolytes ses however up to the present time the ses fabrication for practical asslib construction is still a significant challenge the existing problems include 1 lower ionic conductivity compared to liquid electrolyte 2 poor solid-solid contact interface between electrode and electrolyte 3 volume change of the electrode and 4 the unstable interface of lithium metalpolymer electrolytes causes further capacity fading with the aim of fabricating ses which possess optimal properties a novel se was developed by forming a multilayer structure the multilayer se was fabricated using polymeric and ceramic electrolytes which can integrate the merits from different layers and materials and optimize its overall performancein order to choose an ideal ceramic material for the multilayer electrolyte fabrication three different types of ceramic electrolyte material were synthesized characterized and evaluated including li13ti17al03po43 latp li7la3zr2o12 llzo and li05la05tio3 llt their mechanical strength ionic conductivity ease of fabrication and synthesis and economic expenses of synthesis were evaluated experimentally the influence of sintering temperature synthesis route working temperature and pressure to the overall conductivity were evaluated from experimental observation and analysis it was concluded that latp was an ideal candidate for multilayer electrolyte fabrication for its high conductivity ease of fabrication and synthesis etcthe electrochemical properties of polymer electrolyte peo10-lincf3so22 which was fabricated through hot pressing and solvent casting methods respectively and also gel-polymer electrolyte pvdf-hfp-lincf3so22 were characterized the lithium ion transference number ionic conductivity and thermo-stability were evaluated and discussedbased on the characterized ceramic and polymer electrolytes the multilayer electrolyte was fabricated through various lamination protocols which include hot pressing dip coating and spray coating methods it was found that negligible interfacial resistance exist at latpllt and spe material also an enhanced ionic conductivity was found for the bilayer of latpsolvent casted spe this phenomenon was attributed to the formation of a composition region at the polymerceramic electrolyte interface it was suggested that the boundary of polymer body and ceramic grains may induce a pathway for enhanced ionic transportation the porous latp was fabricated using pmmapvapvb as the pore maker the influencing factors of sintering temperature material selection of ceramic and pore makers and fabrication methods deserve further investigationall-solid-state lithium ion coin cell was successfully fabricated and characterized using the as-prepared multilayer electrolyte and lithium metal anode the coin cell demonstrated satisfactory chargedischarge capability and cyclability at an elevated temperature of 70 c the thickness of se operating temperature material types were important factors in the overall resistance of the multilayer solid electrolyte the unstable lithiumpolymer electrolyte interface at high temperature and high potential is the critical problem for developing asslibs with better cyclability in practicein the end future work was proposed and discussed based on the existing work including 1 multilayer fabrication using glass-ceramic material 2 optimization of porous ceramic electrolyte 3 multilayer composite electrolyte using ceramic stabilizer at the lithiumelectrolyte interface
