calcium sensing endoplasmic reticulum ubiquitination the calcium sensing receptor car a member of g protein-coupled receptor family c regulates systemic calcium homeostasis by activating g q - and g i -linked signaling in the parathyroid kidney and intestineto examine agonist-mediated cell surface trafficking of car we quantified car by elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and found that upon stimulation by extracellular ca 2  car undergoes multiphasic internalization that is dependent on changes in intracellular ca 2 to define the importance of the intracellular c-terminus of car in trafficking and targeting we characterized amino acidsregions potentially critical for receptor localization an rkr motif from amino acid 896 to 898 within the proximal region of the c-terminus of car was demonstrated to be an er retentionretrieval signal that becomes functional when exposed by grafting the rkr motif to ectopic sites within the c-terminus we found that the rkr motif functions in a distance-sensitive manner being more potent at distal locations within the c-terminusto further characterize the contribution of the c-terminus of car to trafficking and turnover we carried out yeast two-hybrid library screening to identify potential interactors for the intracellular c-terminus of car screening both human kidney and brain cdna libraries we identified nineteen interacting proteins one of which is an e3 ubiquitin ligase named dorfin  do uble r ing- f inger prote in  biochemical analyses demonstrated that car and dorfin interact in mammalian cells ubiquitination of car is observed in the presence of proteasomal inhibitor mg132 and ubiquitination and degradation of car are mediated by dorfin via erad  e ndoplasmic r eticulum- a ssociated d egradation pathwayto begin to characterize the biogenesis of car we examined the structural and functional checkpoints in the er  e ndoplasmic r eticulum quality control mechanism for car impaired n-linked glycosylation or disulfide bond formation of car results in er retention and degradation by erad suggesting that glycosylation and disulfide bond formation serve as structural checkpoints in the biogenesis of car interestingly we identified a potential conformation-dependent checkpoint in the biogenesis of the car using both receptor mutants and allosteric drugs
