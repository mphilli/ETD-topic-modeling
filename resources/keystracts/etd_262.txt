adult children caregiving long-term care medicaid physical activity wealth situated in the context of a rapidly aging population this dissertation examines the implications of supplying long-term care ltc services to the elderly in the united states the first two essays investigate private costs of ltc assistance borne by adult children of elderly parents in contrast the third essay focuses on the cost of publicly-provided formal ltc servicesthe first essay analyzes whether adult children devote less time to exercise as time allocation in parental caregiving increases the empirical model is a system of four correlated equations where the dependent variables are hours spent caregiving frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity and hours spent in paid work i use pooled cross-sectional data from the health and retirement study hrs for this analysis results from joint estimation of the four equations indicate limited evidence of a competition between time spent in caregiving and frequency of physical activity parental factors that increase allocation of care time to parents do not comprehensively induce reductions in the frequency of any type of physical activity nor in hours of work among either men or womenthe second essay goes beyond time resources and examines whether dementia onset in parents leads to a reduction in adult childrens household wealth towards this i construct a longitudinal dataset from seven waves of hrs estimates from unconditional quantile regressions indicate that parental dementia substantially reduces household wealth of an unmarried adult child in the upper quantiles of the wealth change distribution in the first two years after parental diagnosis these effects are more pronounced for unmarried adult children without siblings further this response is observed to persist in the subsequent time period as well an examination of mechanisms suggests that both losses in labor income and nursing home expenditures may play a role in leading to wealth declines this paper makes two contributions first it focuses on a broader outcome of private cost and second unlike previous studies it does not limit the analysis to adult children who are informal caregiversthe final essay examines the cost implications of publicly provided formal care services medicaids personal care services pcs state plan benefit is a key mechanism through which states provide personal assistance services to eligible beneficiaries but it is widely claimed that states are reluctant to adopt the program over fears of runaway spending surprisingly there has been very little empirical work on examining the effect of the pcs state plan benefit on medicaid expenditures using aggregate state-level data from 1975 through 2009 this study finds that pcs state plan adoption had no overall effect on medicaid expenditures except briefly during the early-growth years in 1980s further findings suggest that states make decisions to adopt the program based on financial experiences of other adopting states this study provides evidence consistent with the interpretation that when faced with the dilemma of balancing increased access and uncontrolled expenditures state officials adapt the design of an entitlement benefit in an effort to make it less expensivein its entirety the dissertation provides new thinking on two dominant themes in conventional long-term care research caregiver burden and woodwork effect in particular the results of the first and third essay question the presence of caregiver burden and woodwork effect respectively while the third essay challenges the pervasiveness of caregiver burden among unmarried adult children these findings which in some aspect are unexpected in the context of existing literature have important implications for policy intervention and the direction of future research efforts in this area
