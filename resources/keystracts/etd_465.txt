aframe android clipboard android security data residue vulnerability program integration androids design philosophy encourages the integration of resources and functionalities from multiple parties even with different levels of trust such program integrations on one hand connect every party in the android ecosystem tightly on one single device on the other hand they can also pose severe security problems if the security design of the underlying integration schemes is not well thought-out this dissertation systematically evaluates the security design of three integration schemes on android including framework module framework proxy and 3rd-party code embedding with the security risks identified in each scheme it concludes that program integrations on android are unsafe furthermore new frameworks have been designed and implemented to detect and mitigate the threats the evaluation results on the prototypes have demonstrated their effectiveness
