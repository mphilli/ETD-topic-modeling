hhp1p heterochromatin-associated protein in tetrahymena the identification and characterization of heterochromatin-associated proteins has greatly improved our understanding of heterochromatin assembly and dynamics in eukaryotes in this dissertation i identified and cloned a 28 kda polypeptide hhp1p from tetrahymena macronuclei that possesses many features of the heterochromatin-associated protein hp1 from drosophila like other hp1-like proteins hhp1p contains both a chromo domain and a chromo shadow domain however a short domain between the chromo domain and its shadow domain in hhp1p displays some features of linker histone h1 thus this protein is being referred to as hhp1p for h1hp1-like protein in tetrahymena hhp1p specifically localizes in transcriptionally active macronuclei where hhp1p displays a punctate staining patternto further investigate hhp1p function i have disrupted all of the expressed copies of the hhp1 gene in somatic macronuclei hhp1 knock-out \deltahhp1 cells grow at normal rates demonstrating that hhp1p is not essential in tetrahymena however the survival rate of \deltahhp1 cells is markedly reduced compared to that of wildtype cells during prolonged starvation upon starvation \deltahhp1 cells display a roughly 15-fold increase in total macronuclear size along with a reduction in the size of the electron-dense chromatin bodies in contrast in wildtype cells hhp1p becomes hyperphosphorylated during prolonged starvation concomitant with an increase in chromatin body size in addition the activation of two starvation-induced genes is reduced in \deltahhp1 cells while transcription rates of growth-related genes are comparable to wildtype cells these results suggest that hhp1p functions in heterochromatin assembly andor maintenance and it is required for the appropriate expression of certain genes in physiological states such as starvationto investigate the potential relationship between hhp1p and linker histone h1 a double knockout strain was created and studied it appears that knocking out h1 in \deltahhp1 cells partially rescues some wildtype phenotypes suggesting that h1 may function as a suppressor of hhp1 in certain physiological states these results together with preliminary biochemical evidence that hhp1h1 products are detected in cross-linked macronuclei suggest that linker histone h1 may interact with hhp1p in vivo
