dynamics of polynomial automorphisms invariant measures lelong class pluripotential theory let x be an algebraic subvariety of \mathbb c^n and \overline x be its closure in \mathbb p^n coman-guedj-zeriahi proved that  any plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on x extends to a plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on \mathbb c^n when the germs \overline xa in \mathbb p^n are irreducible for all a\in \overline x\setminus x in this dissertation we consider x  for which the germ \overline xa  is reducible for some a\in \overline x\setminus x and give a necessary and sufficient condition for x so that any plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on x extends to a plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on \mathbb c^nwe also study a problem in complex dynamics quadratic automorphisms of \mathbb c^3 are classified up to affine conjugacy into seven classes by forn\ae ss and wu five of these classes contain maps with interesting dynamics  for these maps coman and forn\ae ss estimated the rates of escape of orbits to infinity and described the subsets of \mathbb c^3 where they occur using these estimates they constructed invariant measures for the maps in three of these classes by the work of coman on the fourth class later the dynamics of the maps from the first four classes is completely understood this dissertation  focuses on the dynamics of maps from the fifth class hxyz xyaz x^2by x\ a\neq0\neq bwe investigate the behaviors of h at infinity  and construct a dynamically interesting closed positive current of bidimension 11
