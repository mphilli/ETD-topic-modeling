community detection social networks game theory the edges of a complex network  represent the non-trivial interactions between real-world entities nodes recent mathematical analyses have revealed a great deal about the nature and structure of networks such as the small-world scale-free and community structure phenomena a community structure is a partition of a network into communities based on the network's topology specifically the set of connections within a community is denser than the set of connections in the entire network community structure has been shown to identify functional and logical units of a network's underlying real-world entities traditional research in community detection has focused on top-down optimization of global metrics that evaluate the strength of a community structure over an entire network in contrast this thesis presents a bottom-up approach based on balancing conflicting local node-metrics thus achieving an equilibrium we show through three separate strands of research that this bottom-up approach can be used to discover important community structures first we use a force-directed algorithm to cluster nodes in a 2-dimensional plane next we use a node association function in conjunction with a team formation algorithm our last strand uses solution concepts  from game theory to find and analyze stable community structures we demonstrate the efficacy of our three bottom-up approaches on real-world and benchmark networks in particular our game theoretic approach outperforms traditional methods by more than 20 in difficult cases
