fabry-perot cavity system green laser a high finesse fabry-perot cavity with a frequency doubled green  laser cw 532 nm have been built and installed in hall a of jefferson lab for  high precision compton polarimetry project in spring of 2010 it provides a high  intensity circularly polarized photon target for measuring the polarization of  electron beam with energies from 10 gev to 110 gev in a nondestructive manner  the ir beam cw 1064 nm from a ytterbium doped fiber laser amplifier seeded by  a ndyag narrow linewidth npro laser is frequency doubled in by a single-pass  periodically poled lithium niobate ppmgln crystal the maximum achieved green  power at 5 w ir pump power was 174 w with a total conversion efficiency of  348 the frequency locking of this green light to the cavity resonance  frequency is achieved by giving a feedback to ndyag crystal via laser  piezoelectric pzt actuator by pound-drever-hall pdh technique the data  shows the maximum amplification gain of our cavity is about 4000 with a  corresponding maximum intra-cavity power of 37 kw the polarization transfer  function has been measured in order to determine the intra-cavity laser  polarization within the measurement uncertainty of 07 the prex experiment at  jlab used this system for the first time and achieved 10 precision in  electron beam polarization measurement at 10 gev
