conserved arginine solar energy bacteriorhodopsin proteorhodopsin time-resolved fourier transform infrared ft-ir difference spectroscopy has been used to investigate the photocycles of two membrane proteins bacteriorhodopsin and proteorhodopsin that serve as light-driven h   pumps in the initial studies presented two programs important for time-resolved ft-ir experiments are described the first program divides automatically a 9-hour time-resolved ft-ir measurement into any specified sub-measurements while the second global multi-exponential fit program can extract intermediate spectra and their time constants from time-resolved ft-ir spectra further studies have concentrated on understanding the molecular mechanisms of active h    transport in these systems a characteristic positive band at 1556 cm -1  in the br[arrow right]m difference spectra which shows isotopic downshift and ph dependence is assigned to arg-82 in m making it likely that arg-82 itself functions as the fast h   -release group in bacteriorhodopsin time-resolved ft-ir spectra of proteorhodopsin under conditions that allow so-called fast h   -release suggest that the released h   cannot originate from the schiff base or asp-97 since pr lacks homologs of residues glu-194-204 of bacteriorhodopsin the highly conserved arg-94 analog of arg-82 in bacteriorhodopsin is the strongest candidate for the fast h   -release group in proteorhodopsin in the last chapter the vibrational spectra of arg-82 side chain in the m state of br arg-94 for pr is modeled by a deprotonated alkylguanidine group in a nonpolar solvent and the deprotonated arg-82 at physiological ph is modeled as being stabilized by an indirect h-bond with tyr-83 tyr-95 for pr
