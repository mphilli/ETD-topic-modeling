brownfields local government networks policy tools public management with intensifying pressure to not only solve public problems by  collaborating with actors situated outside the confines of city hall but also to  address complex long-term challenges like climate change adaptation and  sustainability local government public managers find themselves working in  increasingly difficult public management environments currently public  management theory fails to fully prescribe management strategies and behaviors  that enable managers to best achieve their goals in these situations this  dissertation addresses this gap between theory and practice by tracing the  public management processes that lead to outcomes in a set of municipality-led  brownfield remediation and redevelopment projectsutilizing an integration of public management policy tool and  network theories this research compares four project-level case studies in  rochester and buffalo new york to address two primary questions first in  what ways do brownfield projects function as public management networks second  to what extent do network management behaviors by city-level public managers  impact project outcomescontrary to prior research my findings revealed that neither  relationship management nor policy tool strategies alone sufficiently explained  project outcomes instead effective public management occurred when high levels  of political legitimacy were coupled with an integration of policy tool and  relationship management strategies either through network-centric public  managers themselves or through the actions of political champions operating in  partnership with them these findings imply that public management researchers  focusing solely upon relationship management or policy tool explanations  separate from political influences are not fully capturing the true public  management story
