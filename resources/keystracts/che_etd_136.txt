organic chemistry part i4-2-phenylethylindan 7 was synthesized by reaction of cuprous phenyl acetylide and 4-iodoindan the phenethylindan was nitrated in acetyl nitrate in acetic anhydride at 0degreesc work-up and chromatography yielded the 5- and 7-nitro isomers 335 and 625 13 and 14 respectively and ca 4 of 6-acetoxyphenethylindan 15 no trace of intramolecular coupling product 12 was detected reasons for the low yield of acetoxy product were explored nitration of 7 at -20degreesc for 24 hours gave virtually no nitration the possibility of rearrangement of ipso dienes to nitro compounds during work-up was discounted by following the nitration at 0degreesc by '1h nmr spectroscopy this revealed formation of a maximum of ca 2 dienes nitration with acetyl nitrate in methylene chloride gave results virtually identical to nitration in acetic anhydride indicating that attack of acetate on the ipso arenium ion is not a slow steppart iisynthesis of acid 29 was accomplished by the outlined scheme reaction of 29 in anhydrous hf for 8 hours at room temperature did not give the hoped for ipso attack at the methyl group to produce estrone methyl ether precursor 31 but gave virtually exclusive attack para to the methoxy substitution forming cyclononanone 68 in 76 yield reaction at 0degreesc for 45 minutes gave virtually no product cyclononanone 68 was unexpected yet 68 and the transition state leading to its formation show little transannular interactions as seen by molecular models cyclization of the acylium ion generated from the acid chloride of 29 by tin tetrachloride in methylene chloride at -78degreesc gave only a 5 yield of 68 and a large number of unidentified products analysis of the partially separated mixture '1h nmr gave no indication of desired products variations in reactant ratios and raising the temperature to 0degreesc gave virtually identical resultscyclization by the use of a less reactive electrophile the oxycarbonium ion was attempted by reaction of the ethylene glycol acetal of aldehyde 73 with tin tetrachloride in both hexane and methylene chloride at temperatures up to room temperature however this reaction only gave recovered acetal andor aldehydesynthesis of butyric acid derivative 74 and reaction in anhydrous hf gave only starting material after 15 hours at room temperature it was concluded that formation of cyclodecanone 75 was precluded because of severe transannular interactions it was hoped that this would force reaction at the methyl substitution giving rise to a d-homoestrone precursor reasons for this apparent lack of reactivity include insufficient activation of the ipso position insufficiently long lived ipso arenium ion to permit closure or possibly large steric requirements that are necessary to achieve the proper coupling geometry by the methoxylated ring although this possibility is not obvious from molecular models
