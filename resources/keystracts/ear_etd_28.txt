40ar39ar gravity magmatism metamorphic core complexes upb zircon the footwall of the catalina mcc located within the basin and range province has been intruded by several magmatic suites samples were collected from the wilderness suite sills the most voluminous suite upb data from zircon indicate that the wilderness suite sills were emplaced during two separate phases of magmatism the first at 55 ma and the second at 45 ma with additional evidence of zircon growth at 40 ma40ar39ar data from the wilderness suite sills indicate that the majority of the older 40ar39ar apparent ages from both potassium feldspar and mica were obtained from the structurally higher sills in the main range and the younger 40ar39ar apparent ages were obtained on samples from structurally lower sills the potassium feldspar samples yield 40ar39ar age gradients which may be the result of cooling for 5 million years or thermal resetting by the catalina pluton prior to exhumation along the catalina detachment fault 40ar39ar lower intercepts from potassium feldspar in the main range suggest that exhumation of the main range occurred 25 to 23 million years ago in the forerange concordant aft and zft data and 40ar39ar potassium feldspar lower age intercepts suggest rapid cooling due to exhumation 23 to 22 million years ago the muscovite and biotite samples from the wilderness suite sills yield relatively flat 40ar39ar age spectra with ages ranging from 28 to 23 ma representing recrystallization below the closure temperature for muscovite and biotiteforward modeling of aeromagnetic and gravity data from the catalina mcc region indicates a shallow felsic to intermediate subsurface pluton in sharp contact with the wilderness suite sills the age of the subsurface pluton is unknown however on the basis of the gravity and aeromagnetic properties of intrusions in the region a tertiary or mesozoic age subsurface pluton is preferred the age of the pluton relative to detachment faulting can help distinguish between differing models for mcc formation a mesozoic pluton suggests that crustal thickening influenced mcc development and a preexisting zone of weakness may have controlled the emplacement of this body as well as the wilderness suite sills a tertiary pluton suggests magmatism may have initiated low-angle faulting and mcc formation
