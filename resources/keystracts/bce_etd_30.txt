supercritical fluid polychlorinated biphenyls st lawrence river sediments remediation systematic studies have been conducted based on real world pcb contaminated st lawrence river sediments slrss to investigate both the technical and economic feasibilities of supercritical fluid extraction sfe technology on the remediation of pcb contaminated soilssedimentspartition equilibrium data between slrss and supercritical co 2 sc-co 2  with and without 5 mol methanol have been obtained for both total pcbs and 16 major pcb congeners or congener mixtures presented in the sediments the partition coefficients increase roughly in the order of molar weight increase of pcb congeners all the isotherms were fitted with a linear model the model analysis reveals that pcb adsorption onto sediments from supercritical fluids scfs is an exothermic and physical process with the adsorption energy of 4 kcalmol in pure co 2 and 8 kcalmol in co 2 meoh systemthe laboratory scale desorption experiments reveal that pcb concentration in the sediment can be reduced from 2200 ppm to less than 10 ppm 995 extraction efficiency in 25 minutes of extraction time and to less than 5 ppm 9977 extraction efficiency in 60 minutes when co 2 5 mol meoh is usedthe bench scale studies were conducted in a unit equipped with a 2-liter fixed-bed extractor a pcbco 2 separator and an online co 2 recycle system the results show that pcb concentration in the sediments can be reduced from 1840 ppm to less than 5 ppm more than 9973 removal efficiency in 40 minutes and to 3 ppm in 60 minutesa linear driving force model has been developed and employed in a two-step simulation of both the laboratory and bench scale desorption data the parameters obtained from the laboratory scale desorption data are also used to predict the bench scale data and give reasonably good resultsa full scale supercritical fluid extraction process followed by supercritical water oxidation of the extracts has been proposed the base case of the proposed process can treat 36000 m 3 contaminated soilssediments every year the economic analysis of this process reveals that the operation costs are in the range of 142-175m 3  which is competitive with other alternative remediation technologies
