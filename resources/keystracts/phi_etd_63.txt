analyticity a priori knowledge knowledge logic platonism in this dissertation i defend a view that combines an analytic  conception of a priori knowledge with a version of reliabilist  platonism roughly put the analytic theory is the view that our a  priori knowledge can be explained by our grasp of analytic truths  platonism is the view that there are abstract objects and those objects  are partly responsible for some of our knowledge my primary goal is to  show that the hybrid account i develop solves central problems that  arise for the analytic view and platonism on their own one well-known  difficulty facing platonism is the following epistemological concern  given that abstracta are causally inefficacious it is unclear how we  can ever come to know anything about them i argue that platonism on its  own cannot adequately address this problem likewise there is the  following serious difficulty for the analytic theory given the central  role of implicit definitions for the analytic theory if there are good  reasons to doubt the unqualified success of such stipulations it seems  that the analytic theory fails to explain our a priori knowledge i also  show that this is a serious problem for the analytic theory however i  show how a combination of the analytic theory and platonism can address  both sets of difficulties one view makes up for the shortcomings of  the other on the one hand reliabilist platonism helps explain the  success of the relevant stipulations on the other hand the analytic  theory helps show why the causal inefficacy of abstracta is not a  problem for our a priori knowledge
