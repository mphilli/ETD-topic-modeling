iterative reconstruction cone-beam collimators mesh-based reconstruction parallel collimators as a noninvasive molecular imaging technique  single photon emission computed tomography  spect provides the distribution of radioactivity through reconstructing a projection dataset and allows us to visualize 3-dimentional 3d functional information rather than anatomical information within a given organ in this dissertation three fully 3d iterative  expectation maximization  em algorithms including maximum likelihood em ordered subsets em and maximum  a posteriori  em are studied in a variety of spect imaging systems with parallel- fan- and cone-beam collimatorsto improve reconstructed image quality with quantitative accuracy volumetric system models including a strip-area system model sasm a fan-volume system model fvsm and a cone-volume system model cvsm have been developed and implemented for parallel- fan- and cone-beam collimators respectively these volumetric system models accurately describe the photon detection process due to system geometric factors and provide more precise detection probability than other simple approximations such as a line-length system model llsm besides the novel development in system models we have introduced almost all degrading factors into spect and investigated one-ray two-ray or four-ray attenuation correction distance- and angle-dependent detector sensitivity and resolution correction and scatter correctionto suppress reconstruction noise in images many regularization methods have also been compared and the 3d total variation method is the one most employed then the performance of any new development has been evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively through reconstruction of monte carlo simulations experiments and clinical scans of numerical phantoms physical phantoms and patients no matter what collimator is used in the projection acquisition all results demonstrate that our new fully 3d iterative reconstruction approaches outperform the filtered backprojection fbp and em algorithms with llsm in terms of accuracy bias contrast-to-noise ratio resolution uniformity and so on diagnostic performance of brain spect has also been evaluated on a group of patients and much higher sensitivity is observed in new approaches than that in fbp and em-llsm to reduce the computational cost of our new reconstruction approaches parallelized reconstruction using message passing interface has been proposed and studied on a cluster computerfinally different from widely used pixel-based reconstruction a method for nonuniform image sampling iterative reconstruction in spect has been developed and investigated in which a content adaptive singularity-based triangular mesh 2d is employed to represent images preliminary results indicate that mesh-based reconstruction is an efficient and promising approach with respect to image quality computational cost and potential in motion tracking
