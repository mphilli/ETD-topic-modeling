biofilm formation histidine kinase myxococcus xanthus fruiting body formation two component signal transduction systems the complex life cycle of myxococcus xanthus makes it a model organism for studying multicellular developmental processes in bacteria in response to adverse environmental conditions m xanthus aggregates and forms multicellular structures known as fruiting bodies two component signal transduction systems tcs are widely used by bacteria to detect and respond to environmental cues by regulating large-scale changes in gene expression they contain a histidine kinase sensor that detects environmental cues and a response regulator that modulates cellular processes two key regulators of the early stages of fruiting body development are the nla6snla6 and nla28snla28 tcss the response regulators of these tcss nla6 and nla28 are important for the successful completion of fruiting body formation however the histidine kinase sensors that modulate the activity of these key response regulators were previously unknown here we report the identification and characterization of the nla6s and nla28s histidine kinases analysis of nla6s reveals that it represents a new family of bacterial histidine kinases furthermore it plays an important role in the m xanthus life cycle analysis of nla28s shows that this is an important sensor of early developmental events our data suggests that nla28s is involved in sensing the two important events of early development nutrient depletion and cell density in response to these signals nla28s regulates sporulation of m xanthus characterization of nla6s and nla28s expands our knowledge of the signaling networks that regulate initiation of the multicellular developmental process of m xanthus
