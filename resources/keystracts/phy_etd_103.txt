nuclear physics high energy physics explores a basic problem in theoretical high energy physics of obtaining relations between the important parameters such as masses coupling constants magnetic moments or of different particles or resonances discovered up to now in the second part of this thesis we shall discuss superconvergence sum rules  we first impose certain requirements on the high energy behavior of a scattering amplitude obtaining an exact sum rule on its imaginary part and then we approximate these sum rules with a given set of intermediate states
