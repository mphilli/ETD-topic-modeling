age differences item knowledge rule knowledge skill development the current project investigated the effects of item knowledge and rule knowledge on the modifiability of age-related differences in cognitive skill development response times retrieval proportions and item-level strategy shifts were examined experiment 1 established that differences in the frequency of strategy probes following 0 33 or 100 of trials does not affect strategy use in the learning of pound arithmetic equations experiment 2 distinguished the benefits of item and rule pre-training on learning for young and older adults subjects were pre trained with item knowledge rule knowledge or with a control task and then were trained on repeated items in a synthetic operator task item pre-training accelerated item learning with a more substantial benefit for old than for young rule pre-training improved initial response times and accuracy with comparable benefits across age groups the influences of item knowledge utilization and rule knowledge utilization on the interpretation of age differences in skill acquisition are discussed
