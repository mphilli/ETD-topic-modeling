trace cache multithreading processors computer architecture instruction fetch throughput is one of the most significant performance bottlenecks of a simultaneous multithreading processor instruction fetch throughput limits the execution throughput of a simultaneous multithreading processor even when the processor supports a large number of threads a trace cache can improve instruction fetch throughput of a superscalar processor in this dissertation we have presented a new processor microarchitecture topaz  which adds a trace cache to a simultaneous multithreading processor we show that topaz improves performance of a simultaneous multithreading processor an improvement of nine to fourteen percent is observed through our simulations the results are achieved through mathematical analysis and simulation of spec2000 benchmark programs on topaz also in this dissertation an analytical model of trace cache miss rates and trace cache instruction fetch performance are presented the analytical models are used to develop a new tool tulip  for fast performance analysis of simultaneous multithreading and super-scalar processors implementation benefits and applications of tulip are presented the new tool is used as a guide for topaz design and simulation the actual simulation is carried out using a detailed cycle accurate out-of-order simulator a new detailed microarchitecture simulator topazsim  is also presented in this dissertation
