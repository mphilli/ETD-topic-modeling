carbonyl-ene reaction spirastrellolide methylenetetrahydropyrans zinc chloride catalyzed by zncl 2   2-methylenetetrahydropyran has been shown to readily undergo carbonyl-ene reactions with a variety of activated and unactivated aldehydes and ketones in efforts to broaden the scope of the enol ether component of the reaction substituted 2-methylenetetrahydropyrans were studied use of elelctron-rich exocyclic enol ethers provides higher yields in shorter reaction times this new carbon-carbon bond forming reaction allows rapid access to tetrahydropyranyl ketidesisolated from the marine sponge spirastrella coccinea  spirastrellolide a spa is an example of a biologically active natural product that contains the tetrahydropyranyl ketide motif therefore studies toward the synthesis of this natural product have been made employing carbonyl-ene reactions of 2-methylenetetrahydropyrans in particular the synthesis of [45]- and [55]-spiroketal model systems of spa has been achieved through intramolecular cyclization of carbonyl-ene adducts cross-coupling of a [45]-spiroketal model system to the c40-c47 side chain has also been demonstrated the synthesis of the c40-c47 fragment featured wittig olefination to generate the z -double bondin addition progress has been made toward the synthesis of the c26-c47 segment of spirastrellolide a approach towards the def-spiroketal system exploited the exocyclic enol ether carbonyl-ene reaction in a bidirectional manner
