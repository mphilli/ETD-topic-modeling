abiotic and biotic stress response defense response flowering time gene regulation mirna post-transcriptional gene regulation senescence due to their sessile nature plants face multiple threats to their existence that include biotic stresses such as attacks from pathogens herbivores insects and abiotic stresses like heat cold drought water logging lack of nutrients lowhigh light ros and ionizing radiations to face these challenges plants have developed an intricate mechanism of gene regulation that is complex and fine tuned to mount different responses to different signals using the same subsets of genetic resources many such genesproteins that are important to the plant are also important to human beings since plants are a primary source of energy and food among other necessities hence understanding the nature and the mode of regulation of these genes is not only important to our basic understanding but also provides an opportunity to manipulate these genes for the benefit of both plants and humanshere i have tried to characterize three unknown genes from arabidopsis - one encoding a senescence marker sag13 one encoding a putative nonspecific lipid transfer protein nsltp gene designated here as dlp1 and one encoding a microrna named dmir my work sheds light for the first time on a very commonly used marker of senescence and shows that it regulates multiple processes in the plant including disease resistance senescence flowering sugar responses seed germination and seedling developmenti have also characterized another unknown gene dlp1 belonging to a family of genes that encode for many antimicrobial compounds and are components of most of food allergens   in my work i have shown its role defense and flowering and provide evidence that it is regulated by a very interesting but yet novel mechanism both these genes have similarity to other genes in higher plants including many crop species taken together my findings suggest novel ways to manipulate plants for better diseases resistance as well as ways to engineer plants for increased biomass for use as use as livestock feed and biofuels
