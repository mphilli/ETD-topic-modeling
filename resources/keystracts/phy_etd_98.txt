quantum chromodynamics the non abelian gauge theory which describes in the perturbative regime the strong interactions is quantum chromodynamics qcd quarks and gluons are the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory a key feature of the theory due to quantum corrections is asymptotic freedom ie the strong coupling constant increases as the energy scale of interest decreases the perturbative approach becomes unreliable below a characteristic scale of the theory \lambda quarks and gluons confine themselves into colorless particles called hadrons pions protons\ the latter are the true physical states of the theorywe need to investigate alternative ways to describe strong interactions and in general any asymptotically free theory in the non perturbative regime this is the fundamental motivation of the present thesis although the underlying gauge theory cannot be easily treated in the non perturbative regime we can still use its global symmetries as a guide to build effective lagrangian models these models will be written directly in terms of the colorless physical states of the theory ie hadrons
