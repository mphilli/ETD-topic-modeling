reading fluency generalization multiple exemplars general case intervention oral reading although a number of interventions have been shown to be effective for improving students' oral reading fluency rates significantly less research has been conducted to determine which interventions promote generalized reading performance to new texts general case instruction also called multiple exemplar instruction in which teaching examples are carefully selected to sample from the stimulus and response variation is a generalization programming technique that has been applied to myriad community skills but far fewer academic skills the current study sought to apply this generalization programming strategy to promote generalized oral reading fluency the study also sought to compare the efficiency ie the amount of gains made in the amount of intervention time of multiple exemplar instruction and a more typical listening passage previewrepeated readings intervention package participants consisted of 111 first and second grade students from three public schools in a large urban school district one-way anovas on the gain scores from pre-test to post-test were used to assess the effectiveness of multiple exemplar instruction listening passage previewrepeated readings and a time and attention control condition at promoting generalized reading fluency in words correct per minute results showed that students in both the multiple exemplar group and the listening passage previewrepeated readings group outperformed students in the control group moreover multiple exemplar instruction was more efficient implications limitations and directions for future research are discussed
