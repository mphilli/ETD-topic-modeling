attachment goal pursuit motivation relationship self self-expansion the self-expansion model proposes that human beings possess a fundamental motive to expand themselves by incorporating new resources experiences identities and perspectives traditionally the self-expansion model has focused on relationships as a major way to achieve self-expansion although researchers have also pointed out the possibility that other non-relational activities such as work and travel could similarly lead to self-expansion study 1 examined whether an important individual difference ie attachment styles moderated people8217s preferences for relational or non-relational route to self-expansion one major finding was that avoidance was negatively associated with peoples residual preference for relational over non-relational expansion a phenomenon that was mediated by the desire for relationships given the universality of relationships studies 2 and 3 focused on how individuals with different attachment styles achieved self-expansion within a relationship context as function of the role ones relationship partner may have played in study 2 it was found that for individuals high in avoidance thinking of the partner as facilitative towards ones personal goals rather than relationship goals led to an increased sense of self-expansion through the relationship although the type of goal the partner facilitated did not influence the perceived self-expansion of individuals high in anxiety study 3 revealed that thinking of the partner as facilitative or non-facilitative towards personal goals did not impact perceived self-expansion through the relationship for individuals high in avoidance or anxiety this research project makes important theoretical contributions by directly integrating traditional segregated literatures of self-expansion attachment styles and goal pursuit it provides implications for the dynamic ways in which people satisfy the fundamental self-expansion motivation
