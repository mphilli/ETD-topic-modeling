detection and estimation distributed inferece human-machine systems reliable systems distributed inference using multiple sensors has been an active area of research since the emergence of wireless sensor networks wsns several researchers have addressed the design issues to ensure optimal inference performance in such networks the central goal of this thesis is to analyze distributed inference systems with potentially unreliable components and design strategies to ensure reliable inference in such systems the inference process can be that of detection or estimation or classification and the componentsagents in the system can be sensors andor humans the system components can be unreliable due to a variety of reasons faulty sensors security attacks causing sensors to send falsified information or unskilled human workers sending imperfect information this thesis first quantifies the effect of such unreliable agents on the inference performance of the network and then designs schemes that ensure a reliable overall inferencein the first part of this thesis we study the case when only sensors are present in the system referred to as sensor networks for sensor networks the presence of malicious sensors referred to as byzantines are considered byzantines are sensors that inject false information into the system in such systems the effect of byzantines on the overall inference performance is characterized in terms of the optimal attack strategies game-theoretic formulations are explored to analyze two-player interactionsnext byzantine mitigation schemes are designed that address the problem from the system's perspective these mitigation schemes are of two kinds byzantine identification schemes and byzantine tolerant schemes using learning based techniques byzantine identification schemes are designed that learn the identity of byzantines in the network and use this information to improve system performance when such schemes are not possible byzantine tolerant schemes using error-correcting codes are developed that tolerate the effect of byzantines and maintain good performance in the network error-correcting codes help in correcting the erroneous information from these byzantines and thereby counter their attackthe second line of research in this thesis considers humans-only networks referred to as human networks a similar research strategy is adopted for human networks where the effect of unskilled humans sharing beliefs with a central observer called \emphceo is analyzed and the loss in performance due to the presence of such unskilled humans is characterized this problem falls under the family of problems in information theory literature referred to as the \emphceo problem but for belief sharing the asymptotic behavior of the minimum achievable mean squared error distortion at the ceo is studied in the limit when the number of agents l and the sum rate r tend to infinityan intermediate regime of performance between the exponential behavior in discrete ceo problems and the1r behavior in gaussian ceo problems is established this result can be summarized as the fact that sharing beliefs uniform is fundamentally easier in terms of convergence rate than sharing measurements gaussian but sharing decisions is even easier discretebesides theoretical analysis experimental results are reported for experiments designed in collaboration with cognitive psychologists to understand the behavior of humans in the network the act of fusing decisions from multiple agents is observed for humans and the behavior is statistically modeled using hierarchical bayesian models the implications of such modeling on the design of large human-machine systems is discussed furthermore an error-correcting codes based scheme is proposed to improve system performance in the presence of unreliable humans in the inference process for a crowdsourcing system consisting of unskilled human workers providing unreliable responses the scheme helps in designing easy-to-perform tasks and also mitigates the effect of erroneous data the benefits of using the proposed approach in comparison to the majority voting based approach are highlighted using simulated and real datasetsin the final part of the thesis a human-machine inference framework is developed where humans and machines interact to perform complex tasks in a faster and more efficient manner a mathematical framework is built to understand the benefits of human-machine collaboration such a study is extremely important for current scenarios where humans and machines are constantly interacting with each other to perform even the simplest of tasks while machines perform best in some tasks humans still give better results in tasks such as identifying new patterns by using humans and machines together one can extract complete information about a phenomenon of interest such an architecture referred to as human-machine inference networks humains provides promising results for the two cases of human-machine collaboration \emphmachine as a coach and \emphmachine as a colleague for simple systems we demonstrate tangible performance gains by such a collaboration which provides design modules for larger and more complex human-machine systems however the details of such larger systems needs to be further explored
