africa lakes paleoclimate turkana lake sediments are some of the best archives of continental climate change particularly in the tropics this study is focused on three 10m sediment cores and high-resolution seismic reflection data from lake turkana in northern kenya lake turkana is the world's largest desert lake and the largest lake in the eastern branch of the east african rift system it is situated at 2 n at 360 m elevation and is 250 km long and 30 km wide with a mean depth of 35 m the lake surface receives less than 200 mm yr-1 of rainfall during the twice-annual passing of the intertropical convergence zone via indian ocean-derived moisture and evaporation is 2300 mm yr-1 this study is the first to quantify the climate and deepwater limnologic changes that have occurred in the area during the african humid period ahp and since the last glacial maximuma 20-kyr multiproxy lake level history was derived from 1100 km of chirp seismic reflection data in conjunction with gamma ray bulk density magnetic susceptibility total organic carbon total inorganic carbon core lithology and scanning xrf data from sediment cores that were chronologically constrained by radiocarbon dates two desiccation events occurred at 185 and 17 ka when the lake was at least 100 m lower than today as evidenced by basin-wide high-amplitude reflections correlated to sand intervals in the sediment cores lake level rose abruptly at 11 ka as interpreted from an increase in organic carbon content and abrupt shift to silt and clay-sized sediment after which lake turkana overflowed into the white nile river system ahp highstand conditions lasted until 5 ka when the lake became a closed basin the loss of lake turkana as a white nile input likely had significant implications for nascent communities living along the nile lake level has fluctuated but remained at a moderate lowstand since its mid-holocene closurean easterly shift of moisture derived from the congo basin has been proposed as an additional moisture source for environments in east africa during the ahp as evidenced by an expanding number of hydrogen isotope records from lake basins in east africa to determine if atlantic-derived moisture reached lake turkana in the past via the congo basin compound specific c28 n-alkanoic acids hydrogen isotopes dwax were measured from the composite sediment core record from lake turkanathe record revealed that dwax values were depleted by more than -60  during the ahp dwax depletion occurs abruptly at 137 ka and is sustained throughout the ahp and values gradually become more enriched after 7 ka this depletion suggests that congo-derived moisture had a significant influence on turkana precipitation during the ahp but depletion of that magnitude cannot be explained solely by a change in moisture source in addition to the source effect a possible vegetation effect was quantified using stable carbon isotopes of leaf waxes and the amount effect was estimated using modern kenyan amount effect coupled with a published basin fill model it was determined that vegetation can account for up to -17  and amount effect estimations range from -17  to - 24  of the total ahp depletion after accounting for these effects precipitation during the ahp is depleted relative to a 100 increase in precipitation amount which we suggest is driven by an influx of moisture derived from the congo basin our calculations suggest that at least 45 of the moisture supplied during the ahp was congo-derivedthe precipitation-evaporation balance of a lake system is closely related to its heat budget to quantify changes in temperature through the onset and termination of the ahp the paleotemperature proxy called tex86 was used to generate a 14-kyr record of lake surface temperatures for lake turkana this proxy has successfully reconstructed regional and high-latitude paleotemperatures in other large african lakestex86 temperatures from 14 to 04 ka are highly variable and range from 243 c to 286 c with a mean of 259 c there is a long-term trend within the temperature record that follows mean northern hemisphere peak summer insolation and a mean temperature of 262 c during the early holocene decreases to 257 c during the late holocene a century-scale fluctuation of 1 c persists throughout most of the record which appears to be related to lake mixing processes that overprint the regional climate signal based on fluctuations in metal ratios while this reduced sensitivity of the tex86 proxy was an unexpected result from this analysis it has shown that this proxy may have limitations in its application to well-mixed tropical arid-land lake systems despite high-frequency variation tex86 temperatures remain close to the mean for the duration of the record which is attributed to the evaporation response of this lake system
