 the design and fabrication of sophisticated nanoparticle np architectures are of increased desire as potential applications of these materials expand in this dissertation research i focus on designing and synthesizing heterostructured nps with complex morphology and tunable composition chapter 2 focuses on the synthesis of dumbbell nps i was able to make aupd-ag nps which are comprised of an au core and a pd shell where the addition of a third metal ag yielded the epitaxial growth of ag on one side of aupd np results suggest that with increased shell layers n of ag deposition occurs in a sub-monolayer fashion forming small-detached islands on the surface of the aupd by increasing n these small islands eventually coalesce into one primary domain that resides asymmetrically with respect to the aupd core chapter 3 uses the aupd-ag nps as nano templates where through the use of galvanic exchange the composition of the heterostructure can be tuned to aupd-pt aupd-au or aupd-pd more importantly the finalized nps all exhibited personalized morphology of coreshell-hollow aupd-pt coreshell-parachute aupd-au and coreshell-uniform aupd-pd nps the respective systems were tested for catalytic activity where aupd-pt nanoparticles exhibited superior catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation compared to its neighboring systems and a ptc standard finally chapter 5 discusses the work of catalytically active aupt nps where modifications in the pt morphology resulted in coreshell aupt nps or porous aupt dumbbell nps respectively catalytic comparison between the two systems demonstrated the higher catalytic activity of the porous aupt dumbbell np
