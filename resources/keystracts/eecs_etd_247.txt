computer networks performance computer science messages in multimedia systems possess distinct characteristics they exhibit strong correlations restrictions and degrees of freedom in end-user utilization patterns in this work we introduce application's sense of correctness in the transmission and optimization of multimedia messages we formalize the relations between messages in terms of application defined concepts resultant formalization has led to message reduction rules mr\sp2 which provide an abstract machine to explore message optimizationsthe optimization concepts developed which includes neighborhood a mechanism to shift responses in response domain to improve the response timing active prediction a scheme to proactively match user's needs before requests are made if possible passive prediction a method to maintain most likely to be accessed past and future responses by application provided semantics composibility a scheme to combine messages whenever user can be served more efficiently inclusion a scheme to eliminate close-by requests to serve user more effectively message deadlines a method to eliminate messages that are no longer relevant to the service quality have been tested in our testbed mmtp our performance studies on independent and inter-dependent class data applications have revealed significant improvements the end user response time has been reduced in the order of several magnitude the delay variation has been decreased significantly providing a more predictable service the server and network load has been reduced considerably the maximum delay bounds for the system has been derived and verified in our experiments we have found that inclusion rules to be very effective to reduce the maximum delay while the composition rules to boost the throughput and past and future caching schemes to reduce the server and network load by employment of mr\sp2 tremendous performance gains have been achieved and applications not feasible under normal circumstances have exhibited satisfactory performance
