ansamycin antibiotics enantiospecific progress towards an enantiospecific synthetic route to the ansatrienin family of naturally-occurring ansamycin antibiotics is presented herein synthetic design was originally based on the emmons-horner coupling of c9-n and c1-c8 synthons of the target system construction of the c9-n intermediate was motivated by a novel strategy for intramolecular protection of the c13- hydroxyl group as part of a pyranosidic ring system with c17 the pyran ring system was efficiently generated through an asymmetric hetero-diels alder reaction which additionally served to impart chirality to the system as well as dictate c14-c15 olefin geometry and set the stage for sigmatropic development of the c11-c13 contiguous stereocenters mukaiyama aldol technology was successfully employed as an alternative to the ester enolate claisen rearrangement for generating relative stereochemistry at c11-c13 the c3 stereocenter was derived from r--malic acid which was successfully employed to generate the c1-c8 intermediate failure to effect convergence via the originally intended emmons-horner protocol necessitated investigation of several alternative synthetic pathways to the target system linear extension of the c9-n intermediate via  sequential  emmons-horner olefinations to install the all-  trans triene moiety followed by an aldol condensation with ethyl acetate served to complete the carbon skeleton not accounting for c3-stereochemistry attempts to install the requisite stereochemistry at c3 via an asymmetric aldol were unsuccessful several synthetic approaches to the ansatrienin target system are described
