oxygen carbon isotopic calibrations atmospheric circulation precipitation paleoclimate proxy data from the ne usa covering the late glacial through holocene are rare here we present two sediment core records from fayetteville green lake new york ie ne usa a basin core and a wetland core using a 63 cm varved sediment core from the neck region of green lake we calibrate historic period ie 20 th century oxygen and carbon isotope values to measured meteorological indices such as the latitude of the winter vortex over the ne usa and early summer precipitation these historically-derived isotope-meteorological calibrations are extended back into the pre-historic record to 14600 cal yr bp at 10 to 50 year resolution using isotope values from a 112 m wetland coreour results indicate that the winter vortex is characterized by a strong multi-decadal-to-centennial component of variability fluctuating between expanded and contracted geometries when the winter vortex is expanded storms track more frequently from the southeast and southwest carrying precipitation with relatively high  18 o values conversely when the winter vortex is contracted storms track more frequently from the west cross-continental carrying precipitation with relatively low  18 o values as the position of the winter vortex changes dominant storm tracks are modified producing isotopically distinct precipitation that is ultimately recorded by the  18 o calcite in green lakeover long time scales ie millennia the ne usa winter vortex moves in response to precession-forced changes in insolation and the gradual retreat of the laurentide ice sheet over shorter time scales the winter vortex is likely responding to ocean-atmosphere linkages related to thermohaline circulation in the north atlantic regionthe historic correlation between  13 c calcite and early summer may-july precipitation show that greater early summer precipitation results in calcite with relatively low  13 c values and vice versa in other words primary productivity in green lake is reduced during periods of greater precipitation due to increased cloud cover and reduced light availability using this relationship we show that the late glacialholocene is characterized by multi-decadal-to-centennial scale paleo-precipitationcloud variability that fluctuates about a mean valuetogether these results provide the first late glacialholocene record of winter vortex variability and early summer precipitation for the ne usa at 10-50 year resolution
