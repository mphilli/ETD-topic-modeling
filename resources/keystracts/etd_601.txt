chinese academic migrants in the us cultural politics of place and identities gender and migration studies suburban diaspora the myth of model minority weekend chinese schools current literature is scarce on the diverse experiences of hundreds of thousands of mainland chinese who since 1979 have come to the us primarily for graduate study and mostly settled here afterwards in dispersed university or corporate jobs and suburban residences after the immigration act of 1990 many of them have become visible experts in science and engineering yet their struggles as chinese academic migrants simultaneously privileged by their educational backgrounds and disadvantaged by their outsider status in the us often remain invisible possibly due to the myth of model minority mainstream america has seen them as doing-well and well-behaving and scholarship in gender studies asian-american studies science and technology studies and suburban studies has barely acknowledged this group this dissertation documents how a group of chinese academic migrants engage with everyday struggles around their paradoxical immigrant statuses through participation in a weekend chinese language school the title of this dissertation speaks to how this group while appearing peaceful and at ease on the surface is actually paddling non-stop underneath  through individual and communal bootstrapping they manage to survive harsh disciplining mechanisms such as an often-excruciating immigration policy and the tricky discourses of multiculturalism  my data analysis draws upon diverse fields including education sociology philosophy cultural geography asian-american studies gender studies migration and globalization studies what is also interesting about this research is that it focuses on chinese schools instead of chinatowns as significant institutions that mediate this groups migration experience
