cosmology self-avoiding crystalline membranes defect formation this thesis investigates two important topics in modern statistical mechanics the first three chapters are devoted to the statistical mechanics of random surfaces we present an analysis of extensive large-scale monte carlo simulations of self-avoiding fixed-connectivity membranes for sizes number of faces ranging from 512 to 17672 triangular plaquettes self-avoidance is implemented via impenetrable plaquettes  we simulate the impenetrable plaquettes model in both three and four bulk dimensions in both cases we find the membrane to be flat for all temperatures the size exponent in three dimensions is   0955 the single flat phase appears furthermore to be equivalent to the large bending rigidity phase of phantom membranes the roughness exponent in three dimensions is   0634 and its poisson ratio   -0376 these results suggest that there is a unique universality class for flat crystalline membranes without attractive interaction the last chapter deals with the formation and dynamics of topological strings in a u1 linear sigma model in three spatial dimensions for over-damped langevin dynamics we find that defect production is suppressed by an interaction between correlated domains that reduce the effective spatial variation of the phase of the order field the degree of suppression is sensitive to the quench rate a detailed description of the numerical methods used to analyze the model is reported
