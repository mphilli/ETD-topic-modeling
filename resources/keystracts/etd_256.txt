business cycle recovery term structure yield curve in this paper we study the problem of implementation of ross 2013 recovery theorem to disentangle the pricing kernel and physical probabilities from observed bond yields within discrete time affine term structure models as a remedy to the problem of obtaining arrow-debreu prices of state transitions we propose markov chain approximation to autoregressive processes our work suggests that affine setting offers rich structure that enables us to obtain necessary inputs in empirical applications in the second part we estimate a canonical discrete time gaussian three factor term structure model with the us treasury bond yields we decompose bond yields into expectation and risk components without specifying risk adjustment inside the model the results indicate that expectations component can be used in predicting economic activity
