 image and signal processing problems of practical importance such as incompletedata recovery and compressed sensing are often modeled as nonsmooth optimizationproblems whose objective functions are the sum of two terms each of which is thecomposition of a prox-friendly function with a matrix therefore there is a practicalneed to solve such optimization problems besides the nondifferentiability of theobjective functions of the associated optimization problems and the larger dimensionof the underlying images and signals the sum of the objective functions is notin general prox-friendly which makes solving the problems challenging many algorithms have been proposed in literature to attack these problems by making use of the prox-friendly functions in the problems however the efficiency of these algorithmsrelies heavily on the underlying structures of the matrices particularly for large scaleoptimization problems in this dissertation we propose a novel algorithmic frameworkthat exploits the availability of the prox-friendly functions without requiringany structural information of the matrices this makes our algorithms suitable forlarge scale optimization problems of interest we also prove the convergence of thedeveloped algorithmsthis dissertation has three main parts in part 1 we consider the minimizationof functions that are the sum of the compositions of prox-friendly functions withmatrices we characterize the solutions to the associated optimization problems asthe solutions of fixed point equations that are formulated in terms of the proximity operators of the dual of the prox-friendly functions by making use of the flexibilityprovided by this characterization we develop a block gauss-seidel iterative schemefor finding a solution to the optimization problem and prove its convergence wediscuss the connection of our developed algorithms with some existing ones and pointout the advantages of our proposed schemein part 2 we give a comprehensive study on the computation of the proximityoperator of the p-norm with 0  p  1 nonconvexity and non-smoothness havebeen recognized as important features of many optimization problems in image andsignal processing the nonconvex nonsmooth p-regularization has been recognizedas an efficient tool to identify the sparsity of wavelet coefficients of an image or signalunder investigation to solve an p-regularized optimization problem the proximityoperator of the p-norm needs to be computed in an accurate and computationallyefficient way we first study the general properties of the proximity operator of thep-norm then we derive the explicit form of the proximity operators of the p-normfor p  0 12 23 1 using these explicit forms and the properties of the proximityoperator of the p-norm we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the proximityoperator of the p-norm for any p between 0 and 1in part 3 the usefulness of the research results developed in the previous twoparts is demonstrated in two types of applications namely image restoration andcompressed sensing a comparison with the results from some existing algorithmsis also presented for image restoration the results developed in part 1 are applied to solve the 2-tv and 1-tv models the resulting restored images have higherpeak signal-to-noise ratios and the developed algorithms require less cpu time thanstate-of-the-art algorithms in addition for compressed sensing applications ouralgorithm has smaller 2- and -errors and shorter computation times than state-ofthe-art algorithms for compressed sensing with the p-regularization our numericalsimulations show smaller 2- and -errors than that from the 0-regularization and1-regularization in summary our numerical simulations indicate that not only canour developed algorithms be applied to a wide variety of important optimizationproblems but also they are more accurate and computationally efficient than stateof-the-art algorithms
