development gaba neurons specification spinal cord zebrafish spinal cord contains different types of neurons a vast majority of these neurons are interneurons therefore a better understanding of how interneurons in the spinal cord develop is particularly important as it will hopefully enable researchers to establish better treatments for spinal cord injury patients  in this thesis i used zebrafish to study development of two classes of spinal cord neurons - ka cells which correspond to cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons csf-cns and v2b cells both ka and v2b neurons are functionally important in vertebrate locomotor circuitrydevelopment of functional neurons involves progression of genetic cascades that lead to correct cell specification some of the most important genes expressed during cell development encode for transcription factors which are regulatory proteins that can either activate or repress expression of downstream genes  both v2b and ka neurons in zebrafish express a common set of transcription factors - tal1 gata2a and gata3 these proteins are not present in any other spinal cord cell type previous work used a knockdown approach morpholinos to show that gata2a and gata3 have different functions in specification of ka cell types - ka cells require gata2a and ka' cells require gata3 to develop correctly  in this thesis i test whether the same phenotypes occur in null mutants also i investigate the role of tal1 in specification of ka cells and the role of all three gata2a gata3 tal1 genes in v2b specification to do this i used tal1 gata2a and gata3 zebrafish mutantska and v2b neurons also share another characteristic - all these cells are gabaergic therefore i investigate whether tal1 gata2a and gata3 genes are required for correct specification of v2b andor ka global cell fate andor gabaergic phenotypes of these cells in addition i identify a subset of genes expressed by either ka ka' andor v2b cells and analyze the expression of some of these in these mutantsmy results show that tal1 gata2a and gata3 have distinct functions in each neuron type in ka cells gata2a is required for correct expression of the majority of ka markers and the gabaergic phenotype of these cells interestingly both tal1 and gata3 are not required for correct specification of ka cells in ka' cells the situation seems to be reversed - tal1 and gata3 are required for correct expression of all ka' markers but gata2a is required for only some aspects of the ka' cell fate in a subset of ka' cells in v2b cells the phenotypic effects of these mutations are more complicated - neither tal1 gata2a nor gata3 are required for correct expression of all v2b genes however tal1 is required for expression of a subset of these genes and for the gabaergic phenotype of v2b cellsthis thesis contributes to better understanding of ka ka' and v2b neuron specification  also the presented results have broader implications as they underlie the importance of cell type specificity of genetic cascades that lead to correct development of spinal cord neurons
