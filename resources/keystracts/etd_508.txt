distributed detection function optimization optimal hypothesis testing statistical inference in distributed detection there does not exist an automatic way of generating optimal decision strategies for non-affine decision functions consequently in a detection problem based on a non-affine decision function establishing optimality of a given decision strategy such as a generalized likelihood ratio test is often difficult or even impossiblein this thesis we develop a novel detection network optimization technique that can be used to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in distributed detection for which the underlying objective function is monotonic and convex in probabilistic decision strategies our developed approach leverages on basic concepts of optimization and statistical inference which are provided in appendices in sufficient detail these basic concepts are combined to form the basis of an optimal inference technique for signal detectionwe prove a central theorem that characterizes optimality in a variety of distributed detection architectures we discuss three applications of this result in distributed signal detection these applications include interactive distributed detection optimal tandem fusion architecture and distributed detection by acyclic graph networks in the conclusion we indicate several future research directions which include possible generalizations of our optimization method and new research problems arising from each of the three applications considered
