depth of processing approach encoding specificity effect the test expectancy effect tee is a metacognitive phenomenon wherein students commonly request information about the format of an examination ie multiple choice or essay it is presumed that this information provides a cue about how or what to study and that students adjust their examination preparation accordinglyin general previous investigations of the phenomenon have found that students who prepare for a recall examination essay or completion do better on that type of examination than students who have prepared for a recognition multiple choice or true-false examinationtwo different theoretical formulations a depth of processing approach craik  lockhart 1972 and an encoding specificity effect morris bransford  franks 1977 have been offered to explain the phenomenon the current study investigated an additional variable cognitive level of demand of questions which previous research had partially ignoredtwo studies are reported in the first study college students were asked to write 3 mc and 2 essay questions over text material which they were studying in class as predicted questions written in an essay format reflected higher classifications according to bloom's taxonomy than mc itemsa second study was conducted to determine if knowledge of format would influence performance on items varying both in format and in level of question in addition subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their experiences with perceptions of and preferences for mc or essay testsa 3-way repeated measures analysis of variance with expectancy mc or essay as the between-subjects variable and format mc or sae and level of question high or low as the within-subjects variables no main effect for expectancy was found the expectancy by format and the expectancy by level interactions were also nonsignificant likewise there was no significant difference between the two expectancy groups on the long essay questionsthus even though students appear to recognize consistent differences in the demands of mc versus essay items as shown by their responses to the format questionnaire these differences did not translate into differential performance when expectancy was manipulated
