content consumption early adoption self-efficacy willingness to try prolific research on self-efficacy willingness to try and early adoption has repeatedly demonstrated correlation between these variables covington 1984 rogers 1963 bagozzi 1992 davis 1993 yet when it comes to practical application in the interactive industry for example among digital advertising agencies or product developers the strategy of audience-targeted marketing appealing to a specific group often relies heavily on demographic personas rather than psychological personas in large part because such persona types are easily identified and accessible eg i am an early adopter or i am a suburban soccer mom these demographic personas draw heavily from everett rogers 2003 who identified consistent characteristics among early andor willing adopters age generally under 30 income level moderate to high education level college and beyond and level of social interaction high yet there is significant weakness with creating demographic-based personas such as this because this method fails to identify intrinsic motivators for example the above characteristics can be used to create a persona such as a stay-at-home mom 29 college educated household income 75-100k and active in the community however this does not necessarily lead to similar behaviors among each stay-at-home mom because despite sharing demographic categorization each person will have varying underlying psychological makeup and motivation one mother might have high self-efficacy and one might have low self-efficacy and that is likely to impact willingness to try new technologytherefore the ultimate goal of this study - what is the impact of self-efficacy on willingness to try emerging formats of digital content - was to provide evidence of more significant correlation between self-efficacy and willingness to try emerging formats of digital content as opposed to demographic segmentation and willingness to try emerging formats of digital content with emphasis on self-efficacy as the independent variable and the strength of its relationship with the willingness to try variable evidence of correlation which was provided in this study reduces the high uncertainty [of the high-tech market] for both suppliers and consumers resulting in more targeted and effective marketing and product development huh  kim 2008 p 46 - allowing for the targeting of psychological motivators rather than demographics additionally such conclusions will allow for efficient successful encouragement of adoption by either targeting high self-efficacy populations or reducing psychological risk for low self-efficacy populations emerging formats of content can then be presented and tried without fear or confidence-reduction
