statistical selection we consider the problem of selecting the best of k experimental treatments populations in comparison to a control treatment population when the treatments are normally distributed with unknown means and have a common unknown variance our goal is to select the experimental treatment with the largest mean when this mean is larger than the control treatment mean otherwise we select the control treatmentthree different procedures are proposed to satisfy our goal the first procedure is a balanced two-stage stein-type selection procedure r\sb\rm e similar to that of bechhofer and turnbull 1978 we define probability requirements and tabulate procedural parameters for r\sb\rm e the expected sample size is derived and we use it to compare procedure r\sb\rm e with the other proposed proceduresthe second procedure extends r\sb\rm e to an unbalanced two-stage stein-type selection procedure r\sb\rm u r\sb\rm u allows for different sample sizes in a given fixed ratio r to be drawn from the control treatment and the experimental treatments we define the selection procedure and probability requirements procedural parameters are then computed for a number of choices of r the expected sample size is derived and we use it to compare procedure r\sb\rm u to procedure r\sb\rm e for different values of rthe third procedure st combines statistical selection with hypothesis testing and is similar to the method of thall simon and ellenberg 1988 in the first phase we use a selection procedure to determine preliminarily whether the best experimental treatment is better than the control if no experimental treatment exhibits sufficient evidence of being an improvement over the control the procedure is terminated otherwise we proceed to the second phase and test the best experimental treatment against the control the two-phase procedure st is defined and definitions of power and level appropriate for our hybrid decision method are given we calculate procedural parameters and derive the expected sample size of this procedure a comparison of procedure st with procedure r\sb\rm e is discussed
