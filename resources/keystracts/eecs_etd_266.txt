distributed memory the parallelization of several applications result in unstructured data accesses on coarse-grained distributed-memory parallel machines in many cases these irregular access patterns are only available at runtime and are nonrepetitive they may also result in load imbalance in communication and local computation thus to achieve a good performance it is necessary to provide efficient runtime support for unstructured data accesses in this dissertation we present techniques of efficient software support for the minimization of communication overhead for such applications these new techniques are relatively scalable and architecture-independentwe have developed several optimizations for reducing the overall communication cost in particular we have developed techniques to support the following classes of applications 1 breadth-first search-based applications wolff's cluster algorithm and lee's maze-routing algorithm 2 hpf array construction functions packunpack along with hpf array reduction and prefixsuffix functions 3 hpf generalized array reduction function array combining scatter functionin addition we have developed parallel algorithms for vector reduction and prefix primitives that can be used effectively in many applications with structured as well as unstructured data accessesruntime support for some of these applications results in several competing techniques depending on the size of data sets as well as access patterns for such scenarios we have developed decision systems that will choose the best techniques by performing simple measurements at runtime these results are supported by extensive experimental results on the cm-5
