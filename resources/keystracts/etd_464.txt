emisison computed tomography iterative reconstruction maximum a posteriori penalized likelihood reconstruction regularization spect in pet and spect imaging iterative reconstruction is now widely used due to its capability of incorporating into the reconstruction process a physics model and bayesian statistics involved in photon detection iterative reconstruction methods rely on regularization terms to suppress image noise and render radiotracer distribution with good image quality the choice of regularization method substantially affects the appearances of reconstructed images and is thus a critical aspect of the reconstruction process major contributions of this work include implementation and evaluation of various new regularization methods previously our group developed a preconditioned alternating projection algorithm papa to optimize the emission computed tomography ect objective function with the non-differentiable total variation tv regularizer the algorithm was modified to optimize the proposed reconstruction objective functionsfirst two novel tv-based regularizershigh-order total variation hotv and infimal convolution total variation ictvwere proposed as alternative choices to the customary tv regularizer in spect reconstruction to reduce staircase artifacts produced by tv we have evaluated both proposed reconstruction methods hotv-papa and ictv-papa and compared them with the tv regularized reconstruction tv-papa and the clinical standard gaussian post-filtered expectation-maximization reconstruction method gpf-em using both monte carlo-simulated data and anonymized clinical data model-observer studies using monte carlo-simulated data indicate that ictv-papa is able to reconstruct images with similar or better lesion detectability compared with clinical standard gpf-em methods but at lower detected count levels this implies that switching from gpf-em to ictv-papa can reduce patient dose while maintaining image quality for diagnostic usesecond the 1 norm of discrete cosine transform dct-induced framelet regularization was studied we decomposed the image into high and low spatial-frequency components and then preferentially penalized the high spatial-frequency components the dct-induced framelet transform of the natural radiotracer distribution image is sparse by using this property we were able to effectively suppress image noise without overly compromising spatial resolution or image contrastfinally the fractional norm of the first-order spatial gradient was introduced as a regularizer we implemented 23 and 12 norms to suppress image spatial variability due to the strong penalty of small differences between neighboring pixels fractional-norm regularizers suffer from similar cartoon-like artifacts as with the tv regularizer however when penalty weights are properly selected fractional-norm regularizers outperform tv in terms of noise suppression and contrast recovery
