carbon dioxide global change herbivory ecology range management botany atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been increasing since the beginning of the industrial age and are expected to reach 700 ppm during the mid- to late 21st century most research on plant response to elevated c02 has centered on plant processes in isolation from effects of higher trophic levels and studies on the effects of elevated co\sb2 on plant-herbivore interaction have concentrated on insects the objectives of my dissertation were 1 to evaluate the possible effects of elevated co\sb2 on plant-mammal interactions and 2 to determine whether species from yellowstone national park flooding pampa of argentina and serengeti of tanzania responded similarly to elevated co\sb2 and whether responses were dependent on the mode of photosynthesis c\sb3 or c\sb4 of dominant species to test these objectives plant species were grown in growth chambers at syracuse university under ambient 350-370 ppm and elevated 700 ppm atmospheric co\sb2 and under clipped and unclipped conditionsspecies from the 3 ecosystems responded differently to elevated co\sb2 significant increases in biomass occurred only in yellowstone species all c\sb3 plants and increases occurred mostly in crowns and roots storage organs aboveground biomass which is the portion that is consumed by grazing mammals was not affected by elevated co\sb2 there was in general no interaction between clipping and co\sb2 and this suggests that defoliation will not affect how plants respond to elevated co\sb2 reductions in leaf n an index of forage quality occurred only in yellowstone and flooding pampas species no reduction in biomass and nutrient concentration was found in serengeti species since ungulates can not regulate time spent feeding as insects do and since passage time is inversely related to food quality grazing mammals in temperate grasslands may be negatively affected by elevated co\sb2data on plant response to elevated co\sb2 was also compiled from the literature and responses were compared among biomes grassland species had smaller responses than forest species biome origin accounted for more of the variation in plant response than did mode of photosynthesis or growth form thus biome origin was also a good predictor of plant species response to elevated co\sb2
