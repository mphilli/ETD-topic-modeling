shopping monetary transaction cost in the standard economic model a representative utility maximizer chooses quantities of consumption asset holdings and labor force participation without regard to transaction costs such an assumption implies that the purchase of goods and services requires only one real resource money this research relaxes the assumption of zero transaction costs in consumption such that time resources in addition to money are used up when individuals transact in the goods marketsan intertemporal model of household choice is developed and estimated to measure the responsiveness of transaction costs to changes in consumption and money holdings estimates using a two and three year panel from the surveys of consumer finances 1983-1989 suggest that increases in money holdings reduce transaction time in addition the existence of economies of scale in consumption may influence transaction cost the model generates labor and leisure supply elasticities which suggest that households are highly responsive to wage changes in the presence of consumption transaction coststhe model is also estimated with us time series data over the 1959 to 1994 period time series estimates of the recovered transaction technology parameters suggest that time costs are highly responsive to changes in m1 money yet less responsive to changes in aggregate consumptionthe main contribution to the monetary literature is the estimation of parameters which capture the concavity and degree of homogeneity of the transaction technology estimates from the household data suggest that the technology is most likely a member of the constant returns to scale functional family estimates from us aggregate time series lack a definitive position on the scale of the transactions technology the degree of homogeneity of the transaction technology is systematic to the specification of the co-integrating specification
