quarkonia branching ratios bottomonium we have studied the inclusive photon spectrum in [special characters omitted] 2 s   2 s   and 3  s   decays using the cleo iii detector we present the most precise measurements of electric dipole e1 photon transition rates and photon energies for [special characters omitted] 2 s   [arrow right]   cj   1  p   2 s   [arrow right]    cj   1 p   and 3 s   [arrow right]    bj   2 p    j   0 1 2 the rate for rare e1 transition 3 s   [arrow right]    b0   1 p   is measured for the first time we also confirm the hindered magnetic dipole m1 transition [special characters omitted] 2 s   [arrow right]   c   1  s   however the direct m1 transition [special characters omitted] 2 s   [arrow right]   c   2  s   observed by the crystal ball as a narrow peak at a photon energy of 91 mev is not found in our datawe have also searched for the spin-singlet bottomonium states  b 1 s  and  b 2 s  via the hindered magnetic dipole m1 photon transitions 3 s  [arrow right]  b 1 s  3 s  [arrow right]  b 2 s  and 2 s  [arrow right]  b 1 s  no evidence for such transitions are found we set upper limits on the branching ratios which rule out some of the theoretical calculations
