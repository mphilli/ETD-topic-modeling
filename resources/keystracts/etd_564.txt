 in a text called the liber florum celestis doctrine or book of the flowers of heavenly teaching the benedictine monk john of morigny who was active in the first decades of the fourteenth century presents a series of visions of divine and demonic forces a lengthy series of prayers designed to elicit further visions particularly visions of statues that come to life and to grant knowledge of the seven liberal arts and autobiographical details that recount his waking and visionary interactions with a condemned text the ars notoria and his own liber florum  though according to john his own text was originally seen as licit it was in 1323 condemned in paris as heresy and sorcery  this contrast between initial acceptance and eventual condemnation sets up a dynamic that i argue is replicated repeatedly both in classifying the genre of the liber florum and in the visionary events that john narrates  johns text and the visions of divine entities depicted within it make a habit of straddling boundaries the boundaries of licit and illicit animation and stasis divine presence and divine absence  johns text in all its strangeness and evasions of category needs significant contextualization though even with a fully fleshed-out context john and his text still dont quite fit solidly in any one place  it is towards the explanation of this context that the first chapters of this dissertation will most particularly work  this contextualization will help shape an understanding of john that highlights both his alignment with traditional and accepted patterns of medieval monastic practice and theology as well as his deviations from those patterns  in teasing out the ways in which johns practice and the content of his visions maintain such paradoxical states i closely examine how a monk like john would have thought and seen the world around him reconstructing habits of cognition and understandings of perception that are often alien to our own  once as far as is possible this fourteenth century monastic perspective has been reconstructed i move on to a discussion of the difficult materiality of the animated statues seen in johns visions  in reconstructing the intellectual cognitive and sensorial milieu of this one medieval monk i provide a particularized resource for the study of the liber florum as well as more broadly a methodological model for the study of magic in the middle ages that emphasizes the need to tackle the tricky interior spaces of perception and cognition
