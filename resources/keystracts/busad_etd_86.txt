corporate governance family ceos founding family owners institutional investors shareholders strategic human resource management commitment human resource systems chrs are used to elicit an  employee's long-term commitment to the firm and research has shown that chrs  are positively associated with firm performance yet firms appear reluctant to  use these hr systems large shareholders such as institutional investors and  founding family owners have been found to influence the strategic decision  making of the firm yet they have been largely absent from the strategic human  resource management literature this is unfortunate given the strong influence  that large shareholders can exert on firms thus this study examines the  relationship between large shareholders such as institutional investors and  founding family owners and chrs overall the findings indicate that founding  family owners and transient institutional investors tend to influence the firm's  propensity to use chrs specifically founding family ownership stake is  positively associated with the use of high performance hr practices whereas  the relationship between founding family ownership stake and employee  involvement hr practices is positive up to the founding family owning 1122  percent of the total common shares outstanding in addition transient  institutional investors in general tend to oppose the use of chrs finally  large shareholders are associated with the firm having cash profit sharing  sufficient retirement benefits and work life benefits given this large  shareholders ought to be considered in future studies as another factor that  serves to either enable or constrain the firm's use of chrs
