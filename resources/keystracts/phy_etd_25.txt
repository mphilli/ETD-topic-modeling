upsilon b mesons exclusive reconstruction cross section particle physics using 420 pb -1 of data collected on the 5 s  resonance we exploit exclusive reconstruction of b mesons in several channels to measure or set upper limits on the decay of the 5 s  into b [low ] b [low ]  final states for the first time in the world using 25 b decay modes we measure the inclusive b cross-section to be 5 s  [arrow right] bbx   0177  00300016 nb we also establish first measurements of the production rate for 5 s  [arrow right] b  b  and 5 s  [arrow right] b b  and measure their cross-sections to be 5 s  [arrow right] b  b   0119  0023  0013 nb 5 s  [arrow right] bb   0039  0015  0005 nb in other decay channels we establish 90 confidence level limits of 5 s  [arrow right] bb   0038 nb 5 s  [arrow right] b [low ] b [low ]   0051 nb and 5 s  [arrow right] bb   0029 nb we also extract the most precise value of the [special characters omitted] mass to date which is measured to be m [special characters omitted]   54117  16  06 mev
