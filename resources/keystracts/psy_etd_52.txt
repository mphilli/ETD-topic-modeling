young adults anderson's act-r model aging older adults under the tenets of anderson's act-r model anderson  lebiere 1998 an information-processing system is governed by a library of production rules which specify for a given stimulus configuration the requisite processing procedure access to productions is postulated to be in parallel we tested this postulate by measuring production selection and execution as a function of the size of the production library varied from set size 1 to 4 using arithmetic-like rules that operated on digit stimuli after five sessions of training the act-r prediction was confirmed for most younger and a few older participants beyond the special case where only one production was active increases in set size had no further effect on response time the step increase from size 1 to size 1 was substantial and was represented by an analysis of rt distributions as a shift in all three ex-gaussian distribution parameters mu   sigma   and tau   it is suggested that the step size 1 to size 1 reflects either the engagement of processes active in cognitive control or the manifestation of a limited capacity system the form of the step function can also be characterized in terms of task switch costs rogers  monsell 1995 in which case there were constant global and local switch costs attached to the maintenance of any production set 1 in older participants the increase in rt was negatively accelerated and all of the individuals had equivalent rts for set size 2 the curvilinear form of the older adult function was largely determined by global switch costs and a corresponding shift in the  mu  parameter which has been implicated in peripheral processing balota  speiler 1999 preliminary studies also suggest that in either age group non-homogeneous rule sets may be less well-behaved
