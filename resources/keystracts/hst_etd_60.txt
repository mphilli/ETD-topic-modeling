luxury regulation sumptuary law the regulation of luxury by social station was enacted in france throughout the ancien regime an analysis of the frequency and types of sumptuary laws enacted shows that such legislation was prompted by concerns about the correct ordering of french society several themes were common to anti-luxury legislation between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries sumptuary laws regulated the material culture of elite society they served to protect the interests of the poor by ensuring that the surplus wealth of nobles and the rich was redistributed down the social hierarchy in the sixteenth century for example sumptuary laws were enacted to curb the power and wealth of the french nobility by manipulating its material symbols while revolutionary legislators used sumptuary taxes to redistribute the tax burden in favor of the working poorsumptuary law was also an important part of the political culture of france it was used throughout the early modern era to forward political centralization anti-luxury statutes solidified the king's right to define and balance the body politic calls for sumptuary law and the rhetoric of luxury control were also vehicles for charges of corruption by opponents of the monarchysumptuary laws also permitted a certain amount of luxury however this was based in part in the traditional christian notion that abstinence and charity must be voluntary and also in the fact that sumptuary laws were difficult to enforce an analysis of enforcement and evasion patterns in france shows that the population often influenced the content of sumptuary laws through evasion in this sense sumptuary laws were as much a product of french society as they were of the governments that enacted them
