polymers chemical engineering the solubility of argon carbon dioxide methane and ethane in polyn-butyl methacrylate polyn-propyl methacrylate and polyethyl methacrylate was determined at temperatures below the t\sb\rm g of the polymers or encompassing t\sb\rm g at pressures from 1 to 30 atm contrary to expectations the solubility coefficients s for argon and methane were found to be independent of gas pressures or concentration in polymers even at temperatures 30 to 40\sp\circc below t\sb\rm g moreover van't hoff plots of 1n s versus 1t the reciprocal absolute temperature for argon and methane were linear in a range of temperature encompassing t\sb\rm gthe absence of dual-mode sorption behavior of argon and methane in the above polymers is attributed to the fact that polyalkyl methacrylates have a smaller excess free volume in the glassy state than other polymers it is suggested that the values of the product \delta\alpha\cdott\sb\rm g offer a guide as to whether dual-mode sorption behavior will be observed with a given polymer as the temperature is lowered through t\sb\rm g or at some lower temperature \delta\alpha  \alpha\sb\rm r\ -\ \alpha\sb\rm g where \alpha\sb\rm r and \alpha\sb\rm g are the coefficients of thermal expansion of a polymer in the rubbery and glassy states respectivelyas another test of the above hypothesis solubility for argon and methane in glassy polyvinyl chloride pvc were measured at five temperatures from 40 to 80\sp\circc and at pressures from 1 to 20 atm by a gravimetric technique the onset of dual-mode sorption behavior was observed at a temperature just below the t\sb\rm g 88\sp\circc of this polymer as expected from the value of \delta\alpha\cdott\sb\rm g 0126 for pvc in addition the solubility of hydrogen in glassy polyvinyl acetate pvac t\sb\rm g  32\sp\circc was also found to be described by the dual-mode sorption modelthe theoretical analysis of the effects of polymer plasticization assumes the existence of two penetrant populations with different mobilities in glassy polymers expressions for the effective diffusion and permeability coefficients were derived assuming that d\sb\rm d and d\sb\rm h are exponential functions of concentration
