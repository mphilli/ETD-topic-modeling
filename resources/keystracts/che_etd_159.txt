organic chemistry triphenylphosphine dihalides alkyl and aryl halides are important building blocks in organic synthesis  they are useful in alkylation reactions--grignard and friedel-crafts reactions in coupling processes - wurtz and wurtz-fittig reactions in condensations - reformatsky reactions as well as in the preparation of esters and mixed ether
