black hole gravititational waves ligo neutron star spin in this dissertation we study gravitational-wave searches forbinary neutron star and neutron star - black hole coalescenceswe determine the accuracy of post-newtonian approximations as gravitational-wavetemplates in matched-filter based searches for nsbh mergerswe test a geometric method to generate template banks for bns and nsbh mergers wherethe components have intrinsic spin and estimate the sensitivity toastrophysical sources of searches that use these banks during advanced ligowe explore simplifications and optimizations to the search pipeline usedduring s6vsr23 gravitational-wave searches we investigate methods for regeneratingtemplate banks as the noise behavior of a detector changes over time we furtherinvestigate changes to the algorithm for determining coincidence betweencandidates from multiple-detectorsfinally we develop a focused search for binary neutron stars and test improvementsto its configuration using ligo detector data from the most recent sciencerun
