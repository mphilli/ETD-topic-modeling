radioactive waste acoustic probe solid-gas-liquid slurries the development of nuclear weapons technology during the cold war era has left a legacy of large quantities of radioactive waste which are stored throughout the us department of energy us doe nuclear weapons complex during the proposed remediation stages of processing it will be necessary to characterize and monitor these waste slurries by remote methodsacoustic probes have shown promise because of their non-intrusive nature and ability to penetrate optically opaque slurriesa forward theory for the acoustic response in both dilute and concentrated solid liquid slurries is developed it is based on ensemble averaging of the equations of motion in the solid and liquid phases to obtain expressions for the effective properties of the slurry mixture in terms of coefficients which appear in the equations of motion for the solid particle the attenuations predicted from the theory are in generally good agreement with the experimental data obtained by toneburst and pulsefft data acquisition methods for solid-liquid slurries of soda-lime glass particles of 149 m and 65 m mean radius and polystyrene particles of 79 gm radius at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 solids by volumethe forward theory is readily extended to systems containing more than one dispersed phase such as particles and gas bubbles and the theory predictions are observed to be in good agreement with preliminary attenuation data obtained in solid-gas-liquid slurries of soda-lime glass particles of 149 gm mean radius at 5 and 10 by volume and gas bubbles ranging from approximately 25 m to 150 m radius at volume fractions on the order of 10-5an inverse theory is also developed to determine the concentration and solids volume fraction distribution in a solid-liquid slurry given its experimentally obtained acoustic response a tikhonov scheme is employed to regularize the ill-posed integro-differential equations and solve them as a linear programming problem solution of the inverse problem is found to be successful in several cases but the results are observed to be sensitive to the choice of frequency range the physical properties of the particles and the nature of the particle volume fraction distribution
