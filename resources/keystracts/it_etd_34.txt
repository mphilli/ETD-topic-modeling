ansiniso standards z3950 information retrieval this study explored and described factors involved in the development of information technology standards through a case study of ansiniso z3950 information retrieval z3950 application service definition and protocol specification the study's goals were 1 document z3950 development and 2 develop a holistic understanding of that development the critical importance of standards for information handling in the digital environment the evidence of major difficulties in producing standards and the lack of systematic empirical research on standards development motivated the researcher to undertake this studya multi-method research strategy included a qualitative research approach case study and model building data were collected from multiple sources documentary evidence guided interviews with participants in standards development and participant observation of z3950 development a systems-theoretic model provided a conceptual framework for the study and the model served as an analytical tool in data analysis inductive analysis allowed the discovery of additional aspects and relationships in z3950 developmentthe researcher characterizes z3950 evolution as a continuous development in which multiple stages of standards work can be discerned these stages reflect changes in stakeholders goals participants and the environment of the standards work system a revised systems-theoretic conceptual model incorporated constructs that emerged from the data eg mediating mechanisms and relevant environment to represent more adequately z3950 evolution the concept of mediating mechanisms reflects the dynamic social nature of standards development and can account for changes over time in system goals the study demonstrates that complex standards development efforts can be investigated systematically the research strategy the conceptual model and a set of working hypotheses can guide subsequent research
