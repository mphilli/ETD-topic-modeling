thermal automerizations exo-deuteriobicyclo[310]hex-2-enes vinylcyclopropane samples of racemic 4- exo -deuteriobicyclo[310]hex-2-ene 4 x - 1  and racemic 6- exo -deuteriobicyclo[310]hex-2-ene 6 x - 1  were synthesized with high incorporation and stereoselectivity of deuterium label mole percent concentrations as functions of time profiles for the four isomers were secured from the thermolysis of 4 x - 1 at 2249 2401 and 2550c from this data rate constants for the three isomerization paths  k r  k i  and k 15  at the three temperatures were calculated relative participation of the three reaction paths was determined the k r k i k 15 proportions were 481136 the calculated activation parameters for k r  k i  and k 15 were ea 438 448 443 kcalmole and log a 141 141 142 respectivelythermolysis of 6 x - 1 at 2249 2401 and 2550c provided mole percent concentration as functions of time profiles that were compared with the profiles obtained with 4 x - 1  this comparison demonstrates that one-centered epimerization k 6e  plays no kinetically important role at the temperatures and time domains studied
