disposition effect dynamic asset pricing multi-period investment rational agent skewness winning probability in this dissertation  i study the unique statistical features of multi-period returns vs  single period returns and examine their impacts on making inference  about investors' behavior from trading records in particular i focus  on one such feature namely the probability that investors can realize  positive returns in a simple dynamic model of a financial market i  derive a closed form representation of the dynamic relation between  winning probability and holding time and then apply the theoretical  results to studies of disposition effects referring to the tendency of  investors to be reluctant to realize lossesin  essay i i examine the holding time difference between winning  positions and losing positions through theoretical analysis and  simulations i show that the winning probability dynamics more  convincingly than behavioral bias accounts for the observation that  investors hold the losing positions too longin  essay ii i examine the disposition ratio difference between winning  positions and losing positions pgr-plr both theoretical derivation  and simulations confirm that the disposition ratio difference is not  necessarily related to the selling preference of investors but rather  can be the results of investors' rational response to the winning  probability dynamicsin essay iii i  examine the effects of no-trading events on the estimation of survival  models theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that no-trading  events in financial data can seriously bias the estimation of survival  models such as the well-employed cox proportional hazard model and  thus distort our inference about investors' behavioroverall  the behavioral bias argument about the observed disposition effects  does not have solid foundation the rigorous theoretical analysis and  simulations support the argument that the observed disposition effects  as well as the reversed disposition effects are just the expression of  such unique statistical features as the winning probability dynamics and  the effect of no-trading events the long existing puzzle of  disposition effects can be solved within the economic framework in which  market participants are rational agents
