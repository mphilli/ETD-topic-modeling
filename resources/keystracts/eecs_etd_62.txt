collaborative filtering privacy randomization partitioned data with the evolution of the internet collaborative filtering cf techniques are becoming increasingly popular such techniques are widely used by many e-commerce companies to suggest products to customers based on like-minded customers' preferences but they fail to protect users' privacy data from customers is gathered for recommendation purposes however collecting high quality data is not an easy task due to privacy concerns since many users are worried about their privacy they sometimes refuse to contribute their data or occasionally they might decide to give false information producing accurate referrals based on insufficient data andor false data is impossible cf systems provide referrals on existing databases comprised of ratings recorded from groups of people evaluating various items sometimes however the systems' ratings are split among different parties to provide better filtering services the parties may wish to share their data but they may not want to disclose information of a private nature we propose to use randomization techniques to protect users' privacy while still producing accurate referrals we investigate providing predictions on memory- and model-based cf algorithms with privacy assured by using randomized perturbation techniques rpt in chapter 3 and chapter 4 respectively while we show how to produce recommendations without violating users' privacy using randomized response techniques rrt in chapter 5 in chapter 6 we explore inconsistently disguised data-based cf with privacy provided by the rpt when data owners wish to provide recommendations using a joint database without disclosing sensitive data to each other they may achieve accurate privacy-preserving referrals on integrated data with schemes we have proposed we investigate performing filtering tasks including prediction generations and top- n recommendations on vertically or horizontally partitioned data with privacy preservation in chapter 7 and chapter 8 we conduct various experiments using well-known existing data sets to evaluate the overall performance of our approaches furthermore we analyze the effects of different parameters on accuracy and privacy finally in chapter 9 we present our results and explain future directions
