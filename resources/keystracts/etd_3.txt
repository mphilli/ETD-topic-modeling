entropy filter-based multiscale the multiscale entropy mse has been widely and successfully used in analyzing the complexity of physiologic time series in this thesis we re-interpret the averaging process in mse as filtering a time series by a filter of a piecewise constant type from this viewpoint we introduce the \it filter-based multiscale entropy fme which filters a time series by filters to generate its multiple frequency components and then compute the \it blockwise entropy of the resulting components by choosing filters adapted to the feature of a given time series fme is able to better capture its multiscale information and to provide more flexibility for studying its complexity motivated by the heart rate turbulence theory which suggests that the human heartbeat interval time series hhits can be described in piecewise linear patterns we propose the piecewise linear filter multiscale entropy plfme for the complexity analysis of the time series numerical results from plfme are more robust to data of various lengths than those from mse we then propose wavelet packet transform entropy wpte analysis we apply wpte analysis to hhits using lower and higher piecewise linear filters numerical results show that wpte using piecewise linear filters gives us the highest classification rates discriminating different cardiac systems among other multiscale entropy analysis at the end we discuss the application of fme on discrete time series we introduce an `eliminating' algorithm to examine and compare the complexity of coding and noncoding dna sequences
