complexity theory computability topology continuous functionals the notion of type-2 computability occurs naturally in many practical and theoretical settings in computer science for examples machine learning programing languages databases enquiry complexity-theoretic problem reductions and so on are immediate applications of type-2 computation however there is no satisfactory type-2 complexity theory to characterize the computational cost of these widely ranged applications thus the purpose of this thesis is to give a theoretical framework for analyzing the complexity of type-2 computationwe use the oracle turing machine otm as our standard formalism for type-2 computation the best way to characterize the computational cost of type-2 computation is to give a robust notion of type-2 complexity classes in order to do so we first study the induced topologies determined by type-2 continuous functionals of type  n [arrow right] n   n [special characters omitted] n  then based on the compact sets in the induced topologies we define a type-2 almost-everywhere relation [special characters omitted] over type-2 continuous functionals the type-2 almost-everywhere relation [special characters omitted] provides an analogous notion of asymptotic approach for complexity analysis in type-2 we also specify a clocking scheme for otms based on a class of computable functions called type-2 time bounds  t 2 tb  with the tools we developed each type-2 time bound   t 2 tb determines a type-2 complexity class c  we also define a type-2 big-o notation-- o --which would be a useful tool for type-2 algorithm analysisto justify our notion of type-2 complexity classes we prove the union theorem the gap theorem the compression theorem and the speed-up theorem in type-2 along the lines of classical complexity theory most of the theorems we proved are very different from their type-1 counterparts we thus learn that the structure of type-2 complexity classes is not as sturdy as the structure in type-1 they are very sensitive to the topological constraint with theses complexity results we have a reasonable outlook for a general type-2 complexity theory
