african-american subjectivity marxism race henry louis gates cornell west ralph ellison toni morrison richard wright in this dissertation i engage the question of race and i argue for a class theory of race in elaborating upon my position i situate my account within existing theories of race specifically i critically engage postmodern linguistic accounts of race as offered by theorists such as henry louis gates and cornell west as well as the cultural inscription of race within fictional works of ralph ellison toni morrison and richard wright what is missing from these two accounts is the role of class in shaping african-american subjectivity in foregrounding class dimension of african-american identity i argue that the african-american subject is marked by invisibility an invisible presence by invisible presence i mean that african-american invisibility is necessary for the illusion of presence for dominant subjects furthermore the presence of dominant subjects is ideologically related to the logic of the free market african-american subjects are ideologically invisible and yet provide presence for dominant subjects
