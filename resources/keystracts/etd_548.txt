arching case study culvert eps finite element geofoam buried structures may be subjected to excessive stresses that are detrimental to their expected service life  a review of previous design methods shows that there are effective methods to reduce loadings on narrow culverts  the induced trench method introduces compressible fill over a buried structure to mobilize positive arching and transfer stresses to the side fills  however this method has not been studied with bridge culverts large spanning culverts  this study evaluates the use of eps expanded polystyrene geofoam as a compressiblelightweight fill material  the displacements and stresses of the classic narrow trench are examined in detail using the finite difference computer modeling program flac fast lagrangian analysis of continua  the narrow trench is then altered to study the overall effect of thickness and width of the compressible zone upon the stresses acting on the buried structure  to extend the service life of the culvert recommendations are given on how to design with nearly equivalent horizontal and vertical stresses within an induced trench  in deeply buried structures great consideration must also be given to the stresses applied on the geofoam  when geofoam is subjected to large confining axial and confining pressures it exhibits modulus degradation and can lead to large deformations  this is observed in detail with the case study of the failure of the geofoam within a bridge culvert located in carrs creek ny  proper design methods with geofoam on large spanning deeply buried culverts are evaluated and outlined  the effects of continuous joints mixed densities hydrostatic pressures overloading confining stresses and creep on eps geofoam are considered  an exponential model that captures the effect of confinement on modulus degradation has been programmed using fish flac internal coding and verified with complimentary laboratory testing  a properly designed culvert section is shown in which all the design flaws of the culvert at carrs creek have been addressed  the stresses in the geofoam and underlying culvert are reduced to tolerable stress levels while deformations have been greatly reduced  the results of this computer analysis have been presented in such a way that they can be used to aid in proper design of buried structures using geofoam to reduce stresses and surficial displacements
