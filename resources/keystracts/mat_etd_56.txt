calculus limits are central to calculus they are what separate analysis from algebra unfortunately many students find limits to be a difficult and confusing topic in this dissertation i attempt to see how different ways of teaching the concept of limits affect students' conceptions of limits as well as their computational proficiencyto accomplish my goals i taught four different recitation sections each with a different instructional approach the treatments were conducted for a total of three weeks the instructional approaches were paper-and-pencil computational graphics calculator-based paper-and-pencil conceptual and computer-based all the groups except the paper-and-pencil computational group emphasized conceptual knowledge first i found that emphasizing conceptual knowledge except for the graphics calculator group resulted in students that were stronger in conceptual knowledge while emphasizing computation yielded students stronger in computation a notable exception was the paper-and-pencil conceptual group that was at the top of the groups on scores on both conceptual and procedural problems in the instructional activities the students in the paper-and-pencil conceptual group were asked to compute parameters like slopes of tangents themselves this may give some indication that forcing the students to process the information may cause the connections to become more explicitduring the investigation i developed software to help students visualize the concept of limits this software let students dynamically control important parameters in this way the software acted like a virtual manipulative i also enhanced a classification model for students' conceptions that was developed by williams 1991 additionally i attempted to classify errors based on a classification model by movshovitz-hadar zaslavsky and inbar without too much successfinally i developed a set of activities for each of the instructional approaches the activities were similar between the pencil-and-paper conceptual and the computer-based sections but different for the calculator and the paper-and-pencil computational groups these activities rely on the development of exposing discrepant and resolving events to bring the notion of limits to light the activities were designed so that the computational group did not have discussions instead they practiced computational problems however in the activities the conceptual groups were asked to make conjectures and were designed as the foundation of class discussions
