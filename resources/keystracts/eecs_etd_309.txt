cellular automata convergence spaces differential scheme dynamical systems hybrid computation quantum computation it is well-known that standard models of computation are representable as simple dynamical systems that evolve in discrete time and that systems that evolve in continuous time are often representable by dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations in many applications eg molecular networks and hybrid fermi-pasta-ulam systems one must work with dynamical systems comprising both discrete and continuous componentsreasoning about and verifying the properties of the evolving state of such systems is currently a piecemeal affair that depends on the nature of major components of a system eg discrete vs continuous components of state discrete vs continuous time local vs distributed clocks classical vs quantum states and state evolutionwe present the differential scheme as a unifying framework for reasoning about and verifying the properties of the evolving state of a system whether  the system in question evolves in discrete time as for standard models of computation or continuous time or a combination of both we show how instances of the differential scheme can accommodate classical computationwe also generalize a relatively new model of quantum computation the quantum cellular automaton with an eye towards extending the differential scheme to accommodate quantum computation and hybrid classicalquantum computationall the components of a specific instance of the differential scheme are convergence spaces convergence spaces generalize notions of continuity and convergence the category of convergence spaces conv subsumes both simple discrete structures eg digraphs and complex continuous structures eg topological spaces domains and the standard fields of analysis r and c we present novel uses for convergence spaces and extend their theory by defining differential calculi on conv it is to the use of convergence spaces that the differential scheme owes its generality and flexibility
