cabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa matrix lepton energy moments operator product expansion we have determined [special characters omitted] and [special characters omitted] from truncated moments of the lepton energy spectra for both e  and    combining both lepton species we measured two lepton energy moments [special characters omitted]  06187  00014  00016 and [special characters omitted]  17810  00007  00009 the extracted values for [special characters omitted] and [special characters omitted] through order 1[special characters omitted] in the non-perturbative expansion and [special characters omitted] in the perturbative one in the ms scheme are [special characters omitted]  -025  002  005  014 and [special characters omitted]  039  003  006  012 where the uncertainties are statistical systematic and theoretical respectively the theoretical expression needed to extract  v cb  from the measured semileptonic width is evaluated using these hqe parameters using the world average for the semileptonic width we find [special characters omitted]  finally the short range mass of the b-quark [special characters omitted] is evaluated and found to be 482  007 exp  011 th
