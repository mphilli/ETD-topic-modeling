atovaquone calcium citrate chloroquine citmhs kineococcus malaria the citmhs protein family is an understudied area of membrane proteins and yet is an important family regarding basic biological mechanisms  organisms have adapted a way to internalize both metals and citrate simultaneously by recognizing and transporting metal-citrate complexes  the organism studied in this thesis kineococcus radiotolerans has a citmhs member and will be described and characterized in great detail  it is shown that calcium citrate is transported more than any other metal-citrate complex testedsaposin b is a soluble protein that removes damaged coenzyme q10 from the inner mitochondrial membrane and transports it through the body for excretion  it also functions to help degrade lipids by binding them and presenting them to arylsulfatase b  saposin b may have some unknown mechanisms as well  discussed in this thesis is the saposin b binding to the antimalarial agents atovaquone and chloroquine  herein is described the possible uses of saposin b as a treatment for chloroquine poisoning as well as a possible mechanism for how atovaquone is toxic to plasmodium falciparum but nontoxic to humans
