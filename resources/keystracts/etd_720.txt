climate change flow indicator northeastern united states regime shift teleconnection urban development in this dissertation the scale-dependency of hydrologic responses due to changing climate and regime shifts of large-scale circulation patterns and their teleconnection patterns were evaluated using long-term precipitation and discharge records in sub-basins with no development and extensive development and riverine impoundments of the merrimack river watershed the merrimack new hampshire-massachusetts is a 13000 km2 forested 67 watershed located in the northeastern united states the overarching goal of this dissertation was to assess hydrologic responses to the potential effects of changing climate in sub-basins experiencing a range of development in order to help guide sustainable water management in the merrimack river watershed and other northeastern basins the objective of this research was to integrate hydroclimatic observations across basin size and anthropogenic disturbances ie river regulation and land development to understand the dynamic of hydrologic alterations under a changing climatethis dissertation consists of three research phases in phase i i assessed the interacting hydrologic responses to changing climate watershed physical characteristics river regulation and land development under dry average and wet hydrologic conditions using long-term precipitation and discharge data of the merrimack river watershed i found that the effects of basin scale were limited to high exceedance probability of less than 15 and low exceedance probability of greater than 60 discharge events and were expressed as lagged discharge in larger sub-basins and earlier discharge in smaller headwater catchments annual discharge responded to increases in annual precipitation regardless of river regulation or land development in general the temporal trends showed greater decreasing trends in discharge under dry and greater increasing trends in discharge under wet hydrologic conditions compared to average yearsin phase ii i explored the effects of atlantic multi-decadal oscillation amo metric of sea surface temperature anomalies of the north atlantic ocean typically over 0-80n and north atlantic oscillation nao metric of sea-level pressure anomalies over the atlantic sector 20-80n 90w-40e regime shifts on hydrologic responses to evaluate whether the intensified inter-annual variability in discharge is explained by natural climate cycles i focused on amo and nao regime shifts of the early 1950s 1970s and 2000s and the effects on hydrology of the merrimack river watershed amo regime shifts were strongly synchronized and preceded both precipitation and discharge across all study sites by one to two years while nao regime shifts indicated weaker associations i found that all responses tended towards greater extremes from each regime shift to the next across many different ecological discharge indicators high percentile values increased across regimes while low percentile values decreased between regimes with a few exceptionsin phase iii i evaluated the potential for discharge estimation considering annual or seasonal amo and nao teleconnection patterns with precipitation and discharge when amo was extremely positive greater than 02 the magnitudes of annual precipitation and discharge correlation coefficients with amo were obscured by river regulation or land development in contrast during the extreme negative phase of amo less than  02 river regulation and land development amplified the effects of changing climate on precipitation and discharge variations amo was positively associated with precipitation and discharge while nao showed a negative linkage amo positive phase was correspondent with average-to-wet discharge conditions at headwater catchments when basin scale increased confidence in the estimation of discharge conditions decreased for downstream developed sub-basins compared to headwater undisturbed catchmentsthe results from this research indicated that the merrimack river watershed is expected to experience increases in discharge in the future and changing in timing and the seasonal distribution of this discharge therefore development should be avoided on flood plains furthermore the current reservoir storage capacity in the merrimack should be improved in order to accommodate excess water input and minimize flood damage future research should target changes in the magnitude and timing of high discharge events in order to develop adaptation strategies for aging hydraulic infrastructure in the region this dissertation will provide information for watershed planners and managers to inform future sustainable water use in the merrimack river watershed and other northeastern basins
