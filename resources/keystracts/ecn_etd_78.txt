business costs taxes tariffs exchange controls riskiness the last 20 years have been characterized by a dramatic growth of the multinational enterprise mne as mne trade expands more trade and pricing will be governed by the multinational and not by the free market these prices for goods traded by two subsidiaries of the same mne are called transfer prices as a result of being internally determined prices can be altered to shift profits from country to country for the purpose of tax and tariff avoidance foreign exchange control avoidance or for competitive reasons unfortunately there is little data available to characterize the mne's choice of transfer prices although there have been a number of descriptive studies examining the extent of alleged transfer pricing abusesthe purpose of this dissertation is to provide empirical evidence on transfer pricing behavior for us imports the study is concerned with the relationship between the transfer price and taxes and tariffs exchange controls riskiness of a country and extent of mne tradea global profit maximizing mne is examined showing the influence of relative tax and tariffs on the transfer price by imposing fiscal bounds on the transfer price an estimatable equation of mne behavior is derived foreign exchange controls degree of risk and the percentage of multinational trade are added to the model in a less formal waythe model is tested using census data on us imports for 1978 from which relative transfer prices are determined for each product category and country of export to the us the empirical results find that when the profit maximizing mne is induced because of tax and tariff reasons to lower the transfer price the data is consistent with a reduction exchange controls on capital transactions are not as significant the risk variable is consistent with the hypothesis that a lower level of profits is shifted through internal transactions out of the riskier countries than out of the less risky ones furthermore the relative transfer price is lower for every increase in the amount of mne trade within a particular product and country classificationthese empirical results provide support for the belief that differences between the transfer price and the market prices reflect tax tariff exchange control risk and degree of mne trade factors however from an examination of the coefficients of the models it does not appear as if added controls on the mne are necessary no doubt there are some transactions or industries that do alter transfer prices to a great extent but on average the mne appears to keep transfer price alteration--attributable to taxes and tariffs exchange controls risk and degree of mne trade--to a minimum
