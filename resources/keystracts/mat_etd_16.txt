infinitely-ended edge-transitive planar maps petrie walks a construction is described that yields a complete characterization of a class of infinitely-ended locally finite edge-transitive 3-connected planar graphs as a result the members of a second such class are characterized and a complete presentation is given of the members of a thirda petrie walk in a plane graph is a walk with the property that every two consecutive edges are incident with a common face but no three consecutive edges have this property je graver and mewatkins have classified [special characters omitted]  consisting of all locally finite edge-transitive 3-connected planar graphs in terms of the kinds of petrie walks that occur the number of ends of the graph and the edge- vertex- face- and petrie walk-stabilizers in the automorphism group of the graph all ordinary members of [special characters omitted]  ie graphs admitting all vertex-face reflections have been characterized the existence of extraordinary members of each of four distinct subclasses has already been establishedin this work members of two of the four subclasses of extraordinary graph are characterized and a third subclass is completely presented the construction used is an amalgamation construction of b mohar which is a generalization of the interleaving construction used by graver and watkins to produce ordinary members of [special characters omitted]  results about petrie walks in these extraordinary graphs lead to a result about petrie walks in members of [special characters omitted] crossing each other multiple times and answer an open question of graver and watkins
