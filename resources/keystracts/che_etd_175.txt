alkaline earth metals amides co-ligand coordination the chemistry of the  alkali and alkaline earth metal amides has progressed exponentially in  the last 50 years due to advances in synthetic methodologies and  understanding of structurefunction relationships despite these  advances the exploration of the heavy s-block metals has been marred by  numerous challenges related to their high oxo- and hydrophillicity  tendency towards aggregation and electrostatic metal-ligand  interactions the work presented herein addresses the effects that  ligand size neutral co-ligand coordination and presence of secondary  non-covalent interactions have on the chemistry of alkali and alkaline  earth metal amidesuse of sterically  encumbering ligands in conjunction with neutral co-ligand coordination  and their effects on the coordination chemistry of these metals is  presented through a series of novel heavy alkali metal  bisbisdiphenylmethylsilyl amides these compounds exhibit a large  number of non-covalent interactions in the form of metal- contacts  allowing for the isolation of 1-d coordination polymers and a rare  alkali metal separated amido speciesin  addition a novel family of heavy alkaline earth primary amides is  presented these compounds of the type casrba[nhdipp] 2  hmpa  3  dipp  26-di-isopropylaniline hmpa  hexamethylphosphoramide are  the first examples of homoleptic and monomeric primary amido species  reported they showcase the importance of non-covalent agostic  interactions in coordinative metal saturation in both solution and  solid-statethe presence of stabilizing  factors along with their importance and overall effect on  ion-association coordination numbers and resulting structurefunction  relationships will be further discussed for both families of metals  studying the factors influencing ion-association becomes requisite to  understanding the chemistry of organometallic alkali and alkaline earth  compounds and recent findings in these topics will be discussed these  considerations highlight the delicate balance in the organometallic  chemistry of early main group chemistry
