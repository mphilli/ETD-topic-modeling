 nanoparticles are small objects with sizes between 1-100 nm and can have varying properties depending on size or shape the focus in this thesis is preparing three different nanomaterials quantum dots quantum rods and metal halide perovskites first two different protocols to synthesize cdsecds and cdsezns coreshell quantum dots successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction silar and continuous injection will be compared there i will focus on how the protocols affect the optical properties in the hope of forming more stable and brighter quantum dots surface chemistry of nanoparticles is also very important here i utilized the surface interactions of quantum rods to site-selectively coat cdsecds quantum rods in a silica shell which were then further functionalized lastly i prepared metal halide cspbx3 x  br- or i- perovskite nanoparticles which are able to undergo anion exchange in solution however moisture sensitivity of perovskite nanomaterials has proven to be an issue in the past to improve moisture stability i coated the surfaces of perovskite nanomaterials allowing them to be more stable in moisture than typical uncoated perovskites
