 the first observing run of advanced ligo spanned 4 months from september12 2015 to january 19 2016 during which gravitational waves were directly detectedfrom two binary black hole systems namely gw150914 and gw151226 confidentdetection of gravitational waves requires an understanding of instrumental noise transientsand artifacts that can reduce the sensitivity of a search for gravitational wavesstudies of the quality of the detector data yield insights into the cause of instrumentalartifacts and data quality vetoes specific to a search are produced to mitigate theeffects of problematic datathis dissertation provides an overview of the methods used to characterize noisein the ligo interferometers and provides examples of successful removal of transientnoise the data set used in the first observing run is validated further the systematicremoval of noisy data from analysis time is shown to improve the sensitivity of searchesfor compact binary coalescences the output of the pycbc pipeline is used as ametric for improvementthe first direct detection of gravitational waves gw150914 was a loud enoughsignal that removing data with excess noise did not improve its significance howeverthe removal of data with excess noise decreased the false alarm rate of gw151226 bya factor of 567 from 1 in 320 years 39  to 1 in 183000 years  53
