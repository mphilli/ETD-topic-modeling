noncommutative spaces symmetries twisted symmetries quantum field theories on noncommutative spaces are an important area of research in high energy physics because of their importance as a tool to capture aspects of planck scale physics where one expects the spacetime to show noncommutative behavior their emergence in string theory and also as a tool to regularize quantum field theories an important issue in the study of noncommutative quantum field theories ncqft's is that of symmetries introduction of noncommutativity explicitly breaks lorentz invariance however the classical actions of noncommutative field theories are invariant under a twisted action of the poincar group in this thesis we study the consequences of such twisted symmetries at the quantum level we give complete construction of quantum field theories covariant under the twisted poincar action including the explicit form of the twisted poincar generators we find some striking results such as twisting of bose and fermi statistics and removal of uv-ir mixing in the non-gauge theories we also apply the idea of twisting to gauge symmetries and construct gauge theories covariant under twisted action of gauge and poincar groups any gauge group can be treated using our formulation unlike the ordinary noncommutative gauge theories where only u   n   groups admit direct treatment we derive the feynman rules for this theory and find interesting results such as violation of pauli principle and violation of lorentz invariance due to failure of a generalized form of locality we also treat the twisted form of supersymmetry finally we study the formulation of supersymmetry on fuzzy sphere and construct fuzzy supersymmetric instanton we find the zero modes in the instanton sector and study their index theory
