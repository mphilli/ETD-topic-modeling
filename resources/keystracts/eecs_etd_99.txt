support vector parameter selection software hyperparameter selection predictive data modeling is germane to many engineering and scientific applications recently a new type of learning machine called support vector machine  svm has gained prominence for predictive modeling of classification and regression problems however the solution of svm requires some user specified parameters called hyperparameters   in practice these are determined by a computationally intensive grid searchin this research we develop a principled approach for the selection of svm hyperparameters the proposed three step methodology consists of determination of parametric ranges based on their interrelationships setting up experimental designs for an efficient exploration of the error surface and pursuing generating set search for local refinement we demonstrate its efficacy for software module classification and effort prediction problems
