fan high-resistance medium blades heat exchangers filters an investigation of the fluid-dynamic interaction between a closely coupled fan and high resistance medium hrm eg heat exchangers or filters is presented the current study uses simplified 2d airfoilhrm and cascaded-bladehrm models using both cfd computational fluid dynamics and experimental works the airfoilhrm model reveals that the presence of the hrm upstream draw-through system or downstream blow-through system of the airfoil significantly delays stall and drastically enhances the lift capacity of the airfoil although the flow-interaction mechanisms between these two configurations are different for flow-resistance magnitude typical of heat exchangers and filters k-loss factor of 10 or higher it was found that the extent of fanhrm flow-interaction is controlled primarily by the gap distance between the fan and the hrmnext a cfd study was carried out for the cascaded-bladehrm model to study the influence of blade solidity and stagger-angle on blade performance similar to the airfoilhrm study blade performance enhancements in terms of stall delay and increased flow-turning capacity was also observed although a large portion of the increase goes into dynamic pressure rather than the useful static pressure the study indicates that conventional design criteria such as howell's nominal flow turning lieblien's diffusion factor limit and deviation-angle rules are much too conservative for highly-coupled fanhrm configuration one important finding of the investigation is that in the blow-through configuration where the gap distance between the fan and the hrm is very small 5 chord or less there is no sign of conventional blade stall over a very large range of flow-incidence moreover at high flow-incidence a virtual re-cambering of the blade is created by viscous effect resulting in flow-deviation angle less than zero ie flow turning is higher than the ideal case of inviscid-flow and infinite number of blades as the blade stagger angle andor the blade solidity are increased the study shows that blade performance enhancements are reduced in the draw-through arrangement the drop in overall blade performance enhancement is not only due to reduction in turning-capacity improvement but also due to a presence of a more non-uniform flow field in the core region which results in higher dynamic pressure and hence lower static pressure risebased on the above findings several practical design arrangements are presented for closely coupled fanhrm systems for problems where static pressure rise is most critical the current investigation recommends placing hrm's both upstream and downstream of the blade in order to take maximum advantage of the beneficial flow-interaction effects the study also recommends using de-swirling devices to convert the excessive amount of dynamic pressure associated with the larger swirl velocity produced by the highly-loaded blades to useful static pressure finally fans designed for highly coupled fanhrm system should employ new design criteria that are more aggressive than current correlations such as howell's nominal deflection curve and lieblien's diffusion factor limit for hrm with large k-loss factor 10 or higher the new design rules should incorporate the dependency of the blade-loading limit on the gap distance between the fan and the hrm
