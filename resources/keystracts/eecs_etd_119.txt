transmission spectrum semiconductor cylinder fiber optical fiber the growth of optical fiber communication has successfully responded to the increasing demands of high speed and high capacity communications the needs for the optical devices have grown rapidly with the growth of the development for the optical fiber communicationwe have developed a new type of fiber light amplifier a semiconductor cylinder fiber amplifier scfa for use in optical fiber communication the scfa consists of a single mode glass fiber with a thin few nm thick semiconductor film material at between the clear glass core and clear glass claddingthere are materials that can be used that operate in a useful wavelength range and are compatible with our fabrication process we choose cd 3 p 2 or gasb semiconductor films because the quantum size effect allows us to adjust the operating wavelength range we have fabricated two different types of semiconductor cylinder fibers after deposition we check the normalized transmission spectrum data of the preform for energy gap then check the normalized transmission data for the semiconductor cylinder fiberfinally the normalized transmission spectrum data of the semiconductor cylinder fiber has shown valuable evidence that the fiber has a net gain amplification above the normalized absorption transmission
