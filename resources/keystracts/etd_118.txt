child development cognitive abilities reading comprehension the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of specific cognitive abilities and reading comprehension across a variety of norm referenced tests that align with cattell-horn-carroll chc theory of cognitive abilities and integrative models of reading  data from existing studies was analyzed by comparing the relationships of four specific cognitive abilitiesprocesses comprehension-knowledge gc reading decoding rapid automatic naming ran and verbal short-termworking memory on the outcome of reading comprehension across two grade groups 1-3 and 4-10 this synthesis of past research was conducted via meta-analysis of 67 independent samples from 50 studies conducted in the united states between 1998 and 2013 examining the correlations between the variables of interest  meta-regression was conducted using the variable age as a predictor of effect size for both lower order processing skills comprised of reading decoding and ran and higher order processing skills comprised of gc and short-termworking memory  other potential moderating variables socioeconomic status educational status and reading comprehension assessment type were also examined  the results indicate overall large effect sizes r  055 for gc and reading comprehension as well as r  069 for reading decoding and reading comprehension  results also indicate moderate effect sizes r  035 and r  041 for ran and short-termworking memory and reading comprehension respectively  when examining a variety of different standardized measures purporting to assess the same general constructs partial support for integrative models of reading was found for age as a significant predictor for higher order processing skills as increases in effect size of these processes and reading comprehension increased with age the examination of potential moderator variables revealed that the type of response format of the reading comprehension measures was significantly different for lower order processing skills when comparing cloze procedure and multiple-choice formats  implications for applied practice are discussed
