quaternary paleoclimate costa rica glaciation speleothem quaternary climates of the caribbean region are poorly known this study investigates the terrestrial evidence of costa rican quaternary paleoclimates via analysis of the quaternary glaciation of the costa rican highlands to estimate temperature reductions associated with the last local glacial maximum an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability in stable isotope values of costa rican surface waters and precipitation and analysis of the stable isotope values of speleothems to estimate past variations in precipitation amount the highest peaks of costa rica were glaciated during the late quaternary attesting to a significantly different climate in the central american isthmus new evidence of glacial extent comes from striated grooved and channeled bedrock in previously undocumented sites during the last local glacial maximum estimated as 12000 14 c yr bp an ice cap 35 km 2 in extent covered the highest peaks of the cordillera de talamanca around cerro chirrip 2 km 2 of ice existed around cerro kamuk and 5 km 2 existed on cerro de la muerte in chirrip park the paleo equilibrium line altitude ela was 3500 m cirque floor elevations around cerro kamuk of 3260 m suggest a lower paleo ela there the modern 0c isotherm of 5000 m suggest a late pleistocene ela depression of 1500 m associated with a temperature depression of 8 to 9canalysis of a calcite speleothem from the caribbean slope of costa rica provides direct evidence of past variations in precipitation amount on decadal time scales  18 o calcite values prior to 10140 yr bp are 1[per thousand] higher than early holocene values these lower values may be explained by a temperature reduction of 5c decreased rainfall and relative humidity or some combination of the two to interpret the  18 o record preserved in this speleothem a calibration study was undertaken to determine the spatial and temporal variation in stable isotopes in surface waters and precipitation  18 o water values are most strongly correlated with precipitation amount and follow distinct regional trends deuterium excess values suggests that moisture recycling contributes to the moisture flux along the nicaragua trough
