finfet hemt iii-v compound semiconductor simulation tcad transistor scaling following per moore's law slows down its pace when entering into nanometer regime where short channel effects sces including threshold voltage fluctuation increased leakage current and mobility degradation become pronounced in the traditional planar silicon mosfet in addition as the demand of diversified functionalities rises conventional silicon technologies cannot satisfy all non-digital applications requirements because of restrictions that stem from the fundamental material properties therefore novel device materials and structures are desirable to fuel further evolution of semiconductor technologies in this dissertation i have proposed innovative device structures and addressed design considerations of those non-classical field effect transistors for digital analogrf and power applications with projected benefits considering device process difficulties and the dramatic fabrication cost application-oriented device design and optimization are performed through device physics analysis and tcad modeling methodology to develop design guidelines utilizing transistor's improved characteristics toward application-specific circuit performance enhancement results support proposed device design methodologies that will allow development of novel transistors capable of overcoming limitation of planar nanoscale mosfetsin this work both silicon and iii-v compound devices are designed optimized and characterized for digital and non-digital applications through calibrated 2-d and 3-d tcad simulation for digital functionalities silicon and ingaas mosfets have been investigated optimized 3-d silicon-on-insulator soi and body-on-insulator boi finfets are simulated to demonstrate their impact on the performance of volatile memory sram module with consideration of self-heating effects comprehensive simulation results suggest that the current drivability degradation due to increased device temperature is modest for both devices and corresponding digital circuits however soi finfet is recommended for the design of low voltage operation digital modules because of its faster ac response and better sces management than the boi structure the finfet concept is also applied to the non-volatile memory cell at 22 nm technology node for low voltage operation with suppressed scesin addition to the silicon technology our tcad estimation based on upper projections show that the ingaas finfet with superior mobility and improved interface conditions achieve tremendous drive current boost and aggressively suppressed sces and thereby a strong contender for low-power high-performance applications over the silicon counterpart for non-digital functionalities multi-fin fets and gan hemt have been studied mixed-mode simulations along with developed optimization guidelines establish the realistic application potential of underlap design of silicon multi-fin fets for analogrf operation the device with underlap design shows compromised current drivability but improve analog intrinsic gain and high frequency performance to investigate the potential of the novel n-polar gan material for the first time i have provided calibrated tcad modeling of e-mode n-polar gan single-channel hemt in this work i have also proposed a novel e-mode dual-channel hybrid mis-hemt showing greatly enhanced current carrying capability the impact of gan layer scaling has been investigated through extensive tcad simulations and demonstrated techniques for device optimization
