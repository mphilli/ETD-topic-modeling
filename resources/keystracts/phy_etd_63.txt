cellular retinol retinal binding proteins chlamydomonas reinhardtii chlamydomonas is a unicellular phototactic green alga its vision pigment rhodopsin is in the plasma membrane retinal which forms with opsin the pigment is synthesized in the yellow outer chloroplast membrane by -carotene dioxygenase there is aqueous cytoplasm between these two membranes and retinoids are not water-soluble therefore to transfer retinoids between these membranes it is expected that cellular retinoid-binding proteins will act as carriers such carriers crbp mw 1460  16600 d pi 48  49 fluorescence maximum at 485 nm k l for all-trans-retinol 16  10 -8 m and cralbp mw 33000 d pi 50  51 fluorescence maximum at 495 nm k d for 11- cis -retinal 21  10 -8 m are known in animals usually there is an evolutionary conservation between groups the goal of this thesis is to search for cellular retinol-binding proteins crbp andor cellular retinaldehyde-binding proteins cralbp in chlamydomonas  retinol binding is considered because retinol is the storage form of retinoids in chlamydomonas   retinol binds tightly to crbp and cralbp and thus the fluorescence of retinol is used to find these proteins gel filtration and ion exchange are used for purification and retinol binding is used to identify a binding pattern in chlamydomonas  the ratio of total protein to cellular retinol-binding protein is estimated to be 900001 and the ratio of total protein to cellular retinal-binding protein is 410001 based on an estimate of 30000 retinol and retinal moleculescell [3] retinol binding protein rbp in human urine was used as an internal standard to trace protein losses and chromatography was tested with rbp alone and rbp added in chlamydomonas   a crbp candidate was found with a molecular weight 12300  15500 d and fluorescence peak at 490 nm consistent with animal crbp the quantity is also consistent with the retinol concentration found in chlamydomonas  unfortunately the experiment was only done once and insufficient product was obtained for a reliable determination of the retinol-binding dependence
