disability studies no child left behind race to the top special education standards-based reform a critical interpretivist qualitative study this project examines how standards-based reform impacts special education at an urban school called westvale elementary school the school was labeled a persistently low achieving school under the no child left behind act and was thus required to undergo a transformation process the demographics of the school at the time of the study were over 95 free and reduced lunch 40 limited english proficiency and over 20 students with disabilities the racial makeup of the school is 50 hispanic or latino 35 black or african american and 10 white my methodological approach drew primarily upon 19 in-depth semi-structured interviews with teachers administrators and policy makers all participants were either associated with working at or overseeing westvale elementary school i also conducted observations at over 15 public events relevant to the study interview and observation data were contextualized through an examination of public documents such as policy statements or media reportsfindings indicate that the transformation process that westvale was required to undertake was both a dramatic and sanction-laden one for instance prior to the transformation process westvale operated fully inclusive classrooms and afterwards the school shifted to a variety of self-contained tracked and pull-out programs thus a key finding of this study was that standards-based reform impacted the physical inclusion of students with disabilities even if they were accessing at least to some degree regular education content findings also showed how standards-based reform policies including the implementation of the common core standards testing teacher and leader evaluations and accountability systems significantly impacted special education particularly in this failing school financial incentives the media and research all played distinct roles in disseminating standards-based reform ideology which forced failing urban schools to adopt standards-based reform policy even if local educators and administrators believed that the policies negatively impacted students unfortunately the study also documents how special education is often an after-thought during local district state and national policy-making which resulted in policies ill-suited for the needs of students with disabilities finally i illustrate how standards-based reform relies on discourse that blames teachers for the failures of urban schools essentially removing the need to remedy the inequities existent in our educational system i conclude this study with a series of recommendations directed to teachers administrators and policy-makers
