philosophy of linguistics language organ psychological reality i-language psychological view linguists tell us that the sentence 'i enjoyed yourself' is ungrammatical because it violates structural constraints on english sentences is this a fact about the psychology  of english speakers or a fact about some mind-independent  state of affairs if it is indeed a fact about the speaker's psychological makeup then is it so in virtue of the speaker's linguistic beliefs  or knowledge   or can we leave intentional  states like these out of the storymy answers to these questions take the form of these two theses t1 the psychological view is preferable to the autonomous view as a conception of what linguistics--generative grammar in particular--is about the psychological view holds that linguistic theories are best seen as psychological ultimately biological in nature that is as concerned with certain aspects of the mindbrain in contrast autonomist views claim that linguistics deals with an extra-psychological and extra-biological linguistic reality t2 within the psychological view a non-intentional view of linguistics is preferable to an intentional view iv  though linguistics as a psychological discipline studies a mental structure this structure is to be understood in a non-intentional way in particular without making reference to propositional attitudes thus the view i call propositional attitude intentionalism pai must be rejectedto establish t1 i argue that the psychological view can foster and make sense of episodes and even programs of interdisciplinary exchange which are themselves important sources of scientific progress due to the cross-fertilization between the disciplines involved in sum the psychological view in virtue of the integrationist stance it involves makes linguistics more fit for some important sources of progress than the autonomous view does and this gives us a prima facie reason for preferring the psychological viewjerrold katz scott soames and michael devitt have all argued for the autonomous view i reply by showing that their arguments rest on unjustified and ultimately mistaken assumptions in particular on an overly restrictive conception of psychology and on the assimilation of linguistics to the formal science modelas for t2 i reject some of the main arguments offered by some pv authors in favor of pai propositional attitude intentionalism focusing on what i call the explanatory indispensability argument this argument relies on the premise that we must attribute propositional attitudes knowledge belief about grammatical principles to competent speakers in order to explain the content of linguistic intuitions i question the intellectualistic view of linguistic intuition that the explanatory indispensability argument presupposes and then suggest an alternative perceptualcentral view i also cast doubt on the plausibility of pai the states that carry grammatical information seem to be subpersonal subdoxastic and non-conceptual contrary to what pai itself demandsas an alternative to pai i present a broad outline of a non-intentional view which construes linguistics as the study of the language faculty which is an organ of computation linguistics then is a higher-level study of the structural and formal as opposed to dynamic and functional aspects of the language organ
