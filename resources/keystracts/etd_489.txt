episodic memory memory output interference recognition recognition memory testing effects output interference and testing effects are two common occurrences in episodic memory data  output interference is the finding that as a recognition memory test increases in length performance tends to decrease  this suggests that continued testing is detrimental to recognition memory  testing effects are the general finding that repeatedly taking a test contributes to better long-term retention than repeated studying re-reading of the same material   this implies that practicing taking a test is beneficial to the retention and future retrieval of that information  however there are no studies that examine both output interference and testing effects  the current study sought to test recognition memory under conditions that were conducive to both output interference and testing effects  all participants studied a list of words  participants in the study condition then studied the list again and came back for a second appointment where they completed a recognition memory test on the words  participants in the test condition took a recognition memory test after studying the words once  they then took the test again when they came back for the second appointment  additionally participants were either in the repeated or non-repeated targets condition  in the repeated target condition the words were repeated across all three list  in the non-repeated target condition the words on the final test were only shown on the initial study list and not in the intermediary study list or test  the results showed that there were no significant differences in slope performance on the final test over test block between the study and test conditions and the repeated and non-repeated conditions  there was also not a significant interaction  additionally there was not a significant difference in test accuracy between the study and test conditions  however accuracy was significantly greater in the repeated condition than the non-repeated condition and there was a significant interaction  post-hoc t-tests showed that within the repeated targets condition the test condition was significantly more accurate than the study condition  there was not a significant difference in the non-repeated condition  these results suggest that repeated testing does not seem to affect output interference and seems to be beneficial when items are encountered more than once but not when they are encountered only once
