multimedia transmission packet-switched cellular networks multiuser detectors in packet-switched cellular networks base stations corresponding to different cells are connected by wired transmission links to cover the wide area while communication in a cell takes place over wireless channels all streams of messages are divided into packets we consider two types of channellink impairments in packet-switched cellular networks bit errors and packet losses in wireless channels bit errors occur due to channel impairments such as fading interference and noise in addition congestion at the intermediate nodes and at shared resources in wired links causes packet losses bit errors and packet losses are dominant impairments in packet-switching cellular networks and limit system performance multimedia information such as imagery and video is becoming an important part of traffic over such networks these impairments such as bit errors and packet losses significantly impact the quality of service qos of applications and degrade their performancein this dissertation a number of techniques for efficient transmission of multimedia information over packet-switched cellular networks are presented for the uplink channel in ds-cdma systems multiuser detection and channel decoding can be performed jointly to improve the performance of systems we propose a new joint detection-decoding jdd receiver with significantly less complexity and slight reduction in performance this joint detection-decoding receiver can be employed in multimedia applications such as image transmission for more efficient operation the other impairments packet losses need to be corrected at the receiver for reliable communication packet-level forward error correction fec schemes can be improved when they adapt to network conditions these adaptive fec schemes outperform the static fec scheme in terms of the packet loss rate utilizing the concept of gaps that is motivated by the markov gap model for packet losses over the internet adaptive fec schemes can be further improved we study the packet loss process and investigate its modeling using the markov gap model furthermore a gap-based adaptive fec scheme for packet-loss recovery is proposed we employ these new transmission approaches for imagevideo transmission over packet-switched cellular networks and demonstrate superior performance
