development foreign aid rwanda over the course of the last decade there has been an increasing  emphasis on recipient-country ownership or the effective exercise of a  government's authority over development policies and activities including those  that relyon external resources oecd 2007 within the international  development community this new emphasis is not only rhetorical but has resulted  in a host of new aid programs promising increased ownership broadly speaking  these aid programs are supposed to change the institutional relationships  between donors and recipient-country governments and allow aid beneficiaries to  have a say over the development policies that impact their daily lives however  despite their prevalence we know relatively little about how such aid programs  affect donor-government relationships and the policy decision-making process in  aid-dependent statesin the following dissertation project i analyze four ownership  aid programs in post-genocide rwanda the poverty reduction strategy program  budget support the aid coordination harmonization and alignment framework  and the rwandan joint governance assessment in each case study i look for  evidence that the aid program has resulted in the outcomes predicted by their  proponents increased government and citizen influence and decreased donor  influence data largely come from fieldwork i conducted in rwanda during 2009  and 2010my analysis suggests that key rwandan government officials use  the idea of ownership to seek influence over decision-making processes however  the aforementioned aid programs have not resulted in the outcomes predicted by  proponents of the ownership approach in two key ways one donors have not  retreated nor given control over development policy to recipient countries  rather they have sought alternative ways of influencing the policy process two  what we see emerging in rwanda is not broad national ownership instead donors  work with an elite group of government policymakers i call this type of aid  relationship centralized collaboration meaning that multilateral and  bilateral donors work with a small group of domestic actors to design and  implement socio-economic development strategiesi conclude by arguing that this outcome is largely the result of  three things donor preferences the amount of leverage the gor is able to exert  over donors and existing state-society relationships these three factors  provide a framework for assessing and analyzing donor-government relationships  and ownership aid programs in other aid-dependent states
