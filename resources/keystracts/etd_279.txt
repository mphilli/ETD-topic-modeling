hardy spaces the holomorphic functions on the unit disk \mathbbd in the complex plane \mathbbc have a remarkable property to know the values of a holomorphic function on \mathbbd it suffices to know only its values on the unit circle \mathbbt however not all holomorphic functions on \mathbbd are defined on \mathbbt and the major problem of establishing such values called boundary values led to the appearance of hardy spaces h^p\mathbbd p\ge1 if a function lies in a hardy space then its boundary values can be defined and its values on \mathbbd can be obtained using standard cauchy or poisson formulasthe theory of hardy spaces h^p\mathbbd was well developed in the last century and the spaces became the fundamental ground for complex analysis to create analogous spaces in higher dimensions poletsky and stessin introduced new spaces on hyperconvex domains in \mathbbc^n in \citeps we call these spaces the poletsky--stessin hardy spaces poletsky and stessin used them to study composition operators but did not look at their detailed propertiesin this thesis we fill this gap studying poletsky--stessin hardy spaces on the unit disk \mathbbd as in \citeps for their definition we use subharmonic exhaustion functions u and denote these spaces by h^p_u\mathbbd it was mentioned in \citeps that the classical hardy spaces form a subclass of poletsky--stessin hardy spaces our work begins with producing an example that shows that there are subharmonic exhaustion functions u on \mathbbd for which the poletsky--stessin hardy spaces h^p_u\mathbbd are different from classical hardy spaces h^p\mathbbd thus we have an abundance of new function spaces to be exploredwe show that the theory of boundary values for functions in poletsky--stessin hardy  spaces is analogous to the classical theory of hardy spaces and the most of the classical properties stay true for these new spaces since by \citeps the space h^p_u\mathbbd lies in h^p\mathbbd we can use the classical boundary values for functions in h^p_u\mathbbd this allows us to redefine poletsky--stessin hardy spaces as spaces whose boundary values belong to weighted l^p spaces on \mathbbt and we completely characterize the weights that produce poletsky--stessin hardy spaces h^p_u\mathbbdmany problems in complex analysis ask for existence of a bounded function in some class usually it is easier to find a function in h^p_u\mathbbd but they are not necessarily bounded as an application of poletsky--stessin hardy spaces we provide a reduction of such problems to the existence of a function in h^p_u\mathbbd and use it to give shortcuts in the proofs of the famous interpolation theorem and corona problemat the end of the thesis we also study the boundary behavior of functions in the hardy spaces on the polydisk and discuss the intersection of poletsky--stessin spaces on bidisk
