channel coding error control decoding neural networks error control coding or channel coding is an essential part of a communication system recent invention of the state-of-the-art turbo codes and their innovative iterative decoding technique has been a milestone in the history of error control coding turbo coding and decoding made it possible to approach the shannon's channel capacity limit within a few tenths of a db thereby providing incredible coding gains the decoding problem of error control codes has been shown as a promising application of neural networks which have been previously applied to many other fieldsin this dissertation we discovered the equivalence of the bcjr bahl cocke jelinek and raviv algorithm also known as map maximum a posteriori algorithm and a feedforward neural network structure we reformulated the bcjr algorithm which is the optimum soft input soft output siso algorithm using matrix manipulations based upon this new formulation we implemented the bcjr algorithm as a feedforward neural network structure we verified our theoretical work by computer simulations
