channel capacity gaussian interference channels interference channels in a multiuser wireless communication system the transmitters communicate with their intended receivers while generating interference to any unintended receivers interference and the way to deal with it is a central issue in the physical layer design of wireless networks among various multiuser systems the interference channel ic is the simplest model that captures the essence of interference despite decades of intense research effort the capacity region of ic remains unknown except for a few special cases the focus of this thesis is on gaussian ic in particular we examine how interference affects the fundamental performance limits and provide insights on how interference should be treated for various gaussian interference channel models under different operating conditionswe start with inner bounds of gaussian ics including scalar gaussian interference channel gic multiple-input single-output miso ic and multiple-input multiple-out mimo ic for the scalar gic we investigate the use of sato's modified frequency multiplexing fdm idea and obtain the largest computable rate region with cardinality bounds on the number of sub-bands for the miso ic which is more complex than the scalar ic we obtain the achievable rate region under the assumption of single-user detection at all receivers our results indicate that simple transmitter beamforming is optimal to achieve the largest rate region for a two-user miso ic for the mimo ic an even more complex model than miso ic we focus on the study of its achievable sum rate the results show that superposition encoding with sequential decoding achieves a sum rate that is larger than the fdm sum rate at all interference power levels a sharp contrast to the scalar casewe then introduce new outer bounds on the capacity region of gaussian ic the sum-rate capacity of gic under the so-called noisy interference is obtained which constitutes a breakthrough in our understanding of gic with weak interference perhaps more significantly we show that the sum-rate capacity of gic with noisy interference is achieved by treating interference as noise at each receiverfinally we extend the capacity results of a simple scalar gic to more complex networks they include a parallel gic where several transceiver pairs communicate over parallel gics and we characterize the conditions under which treating interference as noise at all receivers is optimal the fundamental result about the concavity of sum capacity as a function of signal power allows us to extend the result to parallel gaussian broadcast channels and parallel gaussian multiple access channels the optimal power allocation scheme also generalizes the classic water filling approach to the single user parallel channels our second generalization involves mimo ic where we derive sufficient conditions to achieve the noisy-interference sum-rate capacity of mimo ic in addition the sum-rate capacity of mimo z interference channel zic and capacity region of mimo ic with strong interference are also obtained that generalize existing known results for the scalar gic
