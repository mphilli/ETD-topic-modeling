immune deficiency sl3 nucleocapsid hiv-1 packaging signal the human immunodeficiency viruses hiv responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids are members of the retroviral family the rna genomic material is packaged in new infective virions during the last stage of the retroviral life cycle a process common to all retroviruses only full-length retroviral rna genome is packaged efficiently a relatively small region of the hiv-1 genome has been found to be critical for efficient packaging of the virus this region known as the packaging signal \psi folds in a secondary structure composed of three to four stem-loop hairpins named sl1 to sl4 no x-ray or nmr three-dimensional structures have been reported for retroviral packaging signals or for their subunits structural studies of the packaging signal may provide clues about the hiv packaging mechanism and suggest tools to defeat aidsthis thesis is based upon the three-dimensional structure determination of a 20-nucleotide stem-loop rna sl3 subunit of the hiv-1 packaging signal using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques nmr is currently the only technique that allows the determination of high resolution three-dimensional structures of biomolecules in solution under nearly physiological conditionssl3 rna was synthesized by transcription of a synthetic dna template by the enzyme t7 rna polymerase uv melting curves native gel electrophoresis and 1d h\sb2o imino proton spectra were analyzed to confirm the secondary structure of the sl3 molecule two-dimensional cosy-type noesy heteronuclear \sp1h-\sp31p-cosy nmr experiments were acquired processed and analyzed to assign resonances and determine distance and dihedral angle constraints the nmr constraints were used to refine the three-dimensional structure of sl3 by running restrained molecular dynamics calculationsthe final structure of sl3 has revealed an a-form stem and a quite flexible ggag tetraloop with the second g10 and fourth g12 bases extruded from the normal stacking arrangement the h-bonding loci of g10 a11 and g12 are unoccupied in the free rna structure and exposed to the solvent available to be easily recognized by possible binding agents in collaboration with dr summers umbc we have shown that sl3 forms a stable 11 complex with the nucleocapsid ncp7 and determined the three-dimensional structure of the sl3-ncp7 complex
