active materials composites electrospinning origami shape memory polymers electrospinning a technique used to fabricate small diameter polymer fibers has been employed to develop unique active materials falling under two categories 1 shape memory elastomeric composites smecs and 2 water responsive fiber mats  1 previous work has characterized in detail the properties and behavior of traditional smecs with isotropic fibers embedded in an elastomer matrix the current work has two goals i characterize laminated anisotropic smecs and ii develop a fabrication process that is scalable for commercial smec manufacturing  the former i requires electrospinning aligned polymer fibers  the aligned fibers are similarly embedded in an elastomer matrix and stacked at various fiber orientations  the resulting laminated composite has a unique response to tensile deformation after stretching and releasing the composite curls  this curling response was characterized based on fiber orientation  the latter goal ii required use of a dual-electrospinning process to simultaneously electrospin two polymers  this fabrication approach incorporated only industrially relevant processing techniques enabling the possibility of commercial application of a shape memory rubber  furthermore the approach had the added benefit of increased control over composition and material properties  2 the strong elongational forces experienced by polymer chains during the electrospinning process induce molecular alignment along the length of electrospun fibers  such orientation is maintained in the fibers as the polymer vitrifies  consequently residual stress is stored in electrospun fiber mats and can be recovered by heating through the polymer's glass transition temperature  alternatively the glass transition temperature can be depressed by introducing a plasticizing agent  polyvinyl acetate pvac is plasticized by water and its glass transition temperature is lowered below room temperature  therefore the residual stress can be relaxed at room temperature simply by hydrating the pvac fibers  this work investigated the response of pvac to the application of water on one surface  more specifically the folding of films of pvac fibrous webs in response to water lines drawn locally on the mat surface was quantified and characterized based on fiber mat characteristics
