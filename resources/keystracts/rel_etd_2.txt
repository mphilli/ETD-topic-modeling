bible history heavenly book icons bible rituals materiality christian history in a 1980 address entitled america's iconic book martin marty claims the bible is a ubiquitous image that is taken for granted in american culture it structures and organizes experiences based on its prominent visibility as it is carried in rituals enshrined in homes illustrated in and as religious art encapsulated in monuments and lauded in miracle stories this dissertation builds on marty's identification of the bible in america as an iconic book that often is revered as an object of power more than as words of instruction information or insight however my study covers a broader scope showing the development of the image of the bible in the history of christianity in various historical contexts iconicity of the bible is demonstrated through both myth and ritual paralleling theory ie verbal explanations and practice ie how people act this dissertation concludes with protestant american attitudes and actions similar to those that marty analyzesmy thesis is that the bible as both text and physical entity has been and continues to function as an icon--an image that mediates between the material and spiritual world and thus is a locus of religious power while most people would readily agree that the bible is an iconic book an immediately recognizable symbol with connotations of admiration or veneration my argument is that a more careful and detailed examination of the bible as an icon that functions as a material mediator enhances our understanding of the power and status given to this book
