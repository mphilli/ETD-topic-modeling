geons unknotted strings point particles it is known that when the classical configuration space of a physical system is multiply connected that system has two or more distinct quantizations the configuration space of n identical systems has such multiple connectivity for a system of n identical particles in a simply connected space of dimension 3 or more the fundamental group is the permutation group s\sbn and this leads to quantization based on its representation and particles which in general obey parastatistics of these only two quantizations are normally used namely one in which the particles obey fermi-dirac statistics and one in which they obey bose-einstein statistics recently however attention has been paid to physical systems where possibilities for quantization in addition to those furnished by representations of s\sbn exist in many of these cases the particles may obey statistics other than parastatistics these statistics are called exoticin this thesis we examine three such examples in the first the physical objects are topological excitations called geons they are believed to exist in generally covariant theories that are diffeomorphism invariant we find that they need not obey any definite statistics the possibilities for statistics that may occur depend on their topology and on the dimensionality of the physical space it is also possible that they may not obey the usual spin-statistics relationthe second example is a system of unknotted strings in 3  1 dimensions we show that this system can also lead to exotic statistics and once more the spin-statistics relation may not be valid we also show that unoriented linked strings may exhibit statistics which oriented ones cannot while for unlinked ones the possibilities for statistics of oriented and unoriented strings are the sameour final example treats point particles on one-dimensional spaces such as circles or lines when one allows for the existence of antiparticles as well as for pair creation and annihilation processes new possibilities for statistics arise such as fractional or indefinite statistics
