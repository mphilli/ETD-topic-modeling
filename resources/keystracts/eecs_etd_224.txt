logic optimization binary decision diagrams bdds provide a compact representation for boolean functions this research is an effort to apply bdds to various cad applications especially those of hierarchically structured circuits the results include a universal bdd manipulator and an algorithm of using bdds in logic synthesis design verification testing etcthe bdd manipulator gbbdd builds bdds for any boolean functions which are originally represented as any compositions of bdds boolean formulae boolean networks boolean operations boolean variables and boolean constants it supports the largest set of bdd operationsthe bdd-based observability analysis bboa calculates the influence relationship between circuit signals it provides effective solutions to cad applications dealing with the relationship between the behavior and the structure of logic circuits in this research bboa has been successfully applied to logic minimization for 100 testability test generation for 100 test coverage restructuring of logic circuits design diagnosis and optimized resynthesis these applications are grouped into two systems one for preserving circuit behavior as circuit structure changes and the other for modifying circuit structure to achieve specified circuit behavior the success of this research effort is based on the recognition of the close relationship between various cad applications
