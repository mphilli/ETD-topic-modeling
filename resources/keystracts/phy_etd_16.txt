d meson cabibbo-suppressed decays branching fraction su3 singlet using 281 p b  -1  of data collected using the cleo-c detector we present new measurements of cabibbo-suppressed decays of d  mesons we report first observations and measurements of the following branching fractions b   d   0  [arrow right] ' 0    81150610  -4   b   d  0  [arrow right]   165141110 -4   b    d  0  [arrow right] '  125251110  -4   b   d  0  [arrow right]      -    109131010  -4   b   d  0  [arrow right] '     -    43160610  -4   b   d    [arrow right]      0  138321610  -4   b   d    [arrow right] '     0    158432610  -4   the uncertainties are statistical and systematic respectively we also present improved measurements of the branching fractions  b   d  0  [arrow right]  0    63100410 -4    b   d    [arrow right]      343141710 -4   and b    d    [arrow right] '     444252610  -4   several other modes are not observed and we set the following 90 confidence level upper limits b   d   0  [arrow right]  0   0    11010  -4   b   d  0  [arrow right]   0    21010 -4   b    d  0  [arrow right]   8010  -4   b   d    [arrow right] k      0910 -4   and b    d    [arrow right] 'k     1110  -4   we have also performed an su  3 topological analysis and find reasonable agreement in the color-suppressed and exchange diagram amplitudes between cabibbo-favored and cabibbo-suppressed decays if we allow for an additional singlet exchange amplitude that couples to the su3 singlet part of the  and ' we find two solutions the small solution which is about two standard deviations from 0 is favored over the larger solution due to ozi-suppression
