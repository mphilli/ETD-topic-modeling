leakage power reduction low-power design cmos vlsi design deep-submicron technologies voltage balancing self-controller leakage power loss is a major concern in deep-submicron technologies high-performance processors and servers consume enormous amounts of operating power for portable devices that have burst-mode type integrated circuits it is acceptable to have leakage during the active mode however during the idle state it is extremely wasteful to have leakage as power is unnecessarily consumed with no useful work being done efficient leakage control mechanisms are crucial for saving power in this research we propose novel leakage current minimization techniques for cmos vlsi circuits a combination of high-threshold and standard-threshold sleep transistors embedded within the cmos topology was used in voltage balancing of the pull-up network pun as well as the pull-down network pdn thereby shutting them off and minimizing leakage loss an ultra-low power standard cell library which uses this technique that achieves cancellation of leakage effects in both the pun and pdn for cmos circuits has been characterized for area delay and power a signal probability based self-controller was designed for leakage power reduction it is the core of this work that sequences the working of these sleep-embedded cells in any vlsi circuit since signal probabilities are used to determine the mode of operation of these cells there is no need for any extra external circuitry for this purpose the ultra-low power standard library consists of 8 combinational and 2 sequential cells experimental results show significant leakage savings an average of 207x in cmos circuits employing this sleep-circuitry when compared to standard cmos circuits a methodology to integrate the ultra low-power library and the self-controller into the low-power synthesis framework is also presented as part of this research comparison of our technique with other well-established leakage reduction techniques shows significant leakage savings of the former over the latter with comparable area and delay performance degradation large leakage savings were observed even at higher temperatures an analysis of these sleep-embedded circuits showed a negligible 042 increase in dynamic power dissipation our technique was also applied to the differential cascode voltage switch logic dcvsl class of circuits an order of leakage savings was observed thereby demonstrating its effectiveness
