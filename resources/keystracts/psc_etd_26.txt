grain contract farming industrial agriculture contract farming is not a new form of industrial agriculture it has been present in several agricultural sectors for decades its wide-spread penetration into the corn and soybean sectors however is a recent development using two case studies vogel popcorn and the aurora cooperative elevator this paper examines the impact of contract farming and agro-industrialization on midwest grain farmersfirst the farmer survey reveals that contract growers seem to benefit economically from contracting grain farmers indicate that contracting raises farm income and lowers marketing risk contracting also diversifies their farming operations however contracting does little to lower income volatility and actually raises production risk it also appears that small growers are often locked out of contracting opportunitiessecond the study finds that the agro-industrialization process challenges the jeffersonian democracy notions of self-government and independence vis-a-vis land ownership and stake holding within the larger society this jefferson believed would help perpetuate our democratic values as a nation however with the continued decline in farm numbers greater corporate consolidation and the movement of farm decision-making power to global corporations agro-industrialization has begun eliminating many of our traditional jeffersonian democratic valuesfor all practical purposes like contract farmers in other sectors of agriculture farmers are slowly losing control over production practices crop ownership crop choice and witnessing a gradual elimination of the traditional open-market this study addresses policy recommendations regarding how farmers and the government can confront these issues
