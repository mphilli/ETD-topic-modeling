evolution visual pigments red-green vision mlws vertebrates to investigate the molecular mechanism and evolution of red-green color vision we cloned sequenced and expressed in vitro the red-green sensitive type pigment genes of 8 mammals goat  capra hircus  rabbit  oryctolagus cuniculus  rat  rattus norvegicus  cat  felis catus  horse  equus caballus  deer  odocoileus virginianus  guinea pig  cavia porcellus  and squirrel  sciurus carolinensis  and the goldfish  carassius auratus  additionaly red-green pigments of three more vertebrates chicken  gallus gallus  frog  xenopus laevis  and cave fish  astyanax mexicanus  that previously had been isolated by other investigators were expressed in vitro the absorption spectra of the purified goat rabbit rat cat horse deer guinea pig squirrel chicken frog cave fish red cave fish green and goldfish pigments had wavelengths of maximal absorption  max  of 553  1 509  1 509  1 553 1 545  1 531  1 516  1 532  1 561  2 558  2 559  2 530  2 and 559  4 nm respectively multiple linear regression analyses showed that differences between the  max values of vertebrate red-green sensitive visual pigments estimated in vitro can be fully explained by the effects of amino acid differences at positions 180 197 277 285 308 and the pair-wise interaction of positions 180 and 197 amino acid substitutions s180a h197y y277f t285a and a308s and interaction the interaction between sites 180 and 197 were estimated to shift  max value by about -7 -28 -8 -15 and -27 and 11 nm respectively this model was corroborated experimentally by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression of constructed visual pigments furthermore the evolution of vertebrate red-green pigments was experimentally retraced by construction and in vitro expression of inferred vertebrate ancestral pigments the results of this analysis suggest that extant red-green pigments evolved from a red-sensitive ancestral pigment with a  max value of about 560 nm
