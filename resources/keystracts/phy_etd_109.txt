phase contrast imaging x-ray holography ultrafast lasers x-ray micro-computed tomography micro-ct is used for   in-vivo  tumor imaging in small-animal models of human disease for the purpose  of assessing the effectiveness of experimental drugs andor treatments  we have been constructing developing as well as investigating the  imaging performance experimentally of an  in-vivo   in-line holography x-ray phase-contrast cone-beam micro-ct system with an ultrafast laser plasma-based x-ray source ulxprojection  images of various pmma step wedge silicon step wedge and nylon fiber  phantoms obtained using ulx with mo and ta targets and a be filter  were acquired in the fresnel diffraction regime absorption contrast  phase contrast and the edge enhancement index were estimated line  profiles obtained for images of nylon fibers were compared to  theoretical simulations projection images obtained using ulx exhibited  strong diffraction fringes we found phase contrast to exceed absorption  contrast by a factor of three in step-wedge imagesabsorption ct projection sets of phantoms were acquired at various distances using ulx with mo target and be filter an  ex-vivo  tomosynthesis projection set 27 projections over 26 trajectory of a  mouse was acquired using ulx a novel cone-beam ct alignment method  using small attenuating spheres to determine the system geometry was  implemented software was developed and applied for raw image  pre-processing reconstructed images were compared to images obtained  using a commercial micro-ct scanner we established that our ulx  micro-ct system is capable of phase-contrast projection imaging and ct  projection set acquisition however laser and x-ray target chamber  problems limited the quantity and quality of the images we obtained  reconstructed images of the cylindrical phantom and  ex-vivo  mouse acquired with ulx are not yet superior to those acquired with a conventional micro-ct scannerin conclusion we demonstrated that a ulx source can be applied to   in-vivo  micro-ct imaging and phase-contrast imaging provided that sufficient  average power and temporal stability is achieved such a ulx source  would allow obtaining information on the real part of the x-ray  refracting index distribution in live small animals such information  cannot be obtained by using a conventional micro-ct scannerkeywords  in-vivo  micro-ct x-ray phase-contrast imaging in-line x-ray holography ultrafast laser plasma-based x-ray source
