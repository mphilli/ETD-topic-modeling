magnetism the aim of this thesis is to understand surface magnetism from an electronic structure point of view specifically heavy rare earth metal surfaces especially gd0001 surface were chosen because they provide the extreme examples of surface magnetism experimentally spectroscopy techniques such as photoemission in different modes and spin-polarized photoemission are utilized to probe the electronic structure and magnetic order of the bulk and surfacea new surface state near e\sbf in the vicinity of \bar\gamma has been observed which has 5d\sb3z\sp2-r\sp2 character and is spatially localized our experimental results and a recent theoretical calculation agree with each other on many aspects the existence of this localized surface state explains the altered magnetic coupling and magnetic moment at the surface and therefore provides considerable insight into the origin of that enhanced magnetic ordering at the gd0001 surface this surface state is shown to be a magnetic state there is an imperfect ferromagnetic coupling between the surface and bulk with a perpendicular component of magnetic moment at the surfacehydrogen dissociatively chemisorbs onto gd0001 surface to form 1 x 1 structure with no surface reconstruction observed a pair of two-dimensional bands are induced by hydrogen adsorption the highly localized 5d surface state of the clean surface is converted into a dispersive h-induced state this conversion gives us the insight into the origin of the anticipated altered magnetic coupling and magnetic moment at the surfacefor the bulk bands the exchange splitting changes with temperature while for the surface state spin mixing is observed a simple picture which embodies the differences in the relative localization is employed to understand these differences between the surface and the bulkthe j-j coupling multiplet splittings of the 5p photoemission feature were observed and later calculated with an atomic calculation the magnetic order is probed from the 5p levels with linearly polarized light for paramagnetic rare earth metals \rm tt\sb\it c on a ferromagnetic substrate magnetic order is induced in the overlayer which can be modeled with ginzberg-landau's theory
