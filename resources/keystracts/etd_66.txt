health insurance social security taxation this dissertation is composed of three papers that study aspects in social insurance system in the us the first paper seeks to further understand the effect of public insurance expansions on private insurance market in particular it investigates the spillover effect of the state children's health insurance program schip--the most recent and largest public insurance expansion prior to the affordable care act aca--on employer-sponsored insurance esi premiums the last two papers explore distortions of tax provisions in the social security system on older taxpayers' economic behaviorin the first paper i analyze the extent to which esi premiums are affected by schip esi premiums can be affected because the health composition of the esi pool may change due to the crowd-out effect the lower income families that are eligible for public health insurance tend to have worse health than the average working family national center for health statistics 2012 therefore individuals who drop esi coverage once their children become eligible for schip or their children have worse than average health the resulting esi risk pool becomes less costly to insurance companies which leads to a decline of the average premiums for those who remain in the esi insurance pool thus overall premiums would decline even though the majority in the pool is not eligible for public insurance my estimates relying on variations in time of implementation and size of expansions across states indicate that esi premiums would have increased by about two percent had schip not been expanded it confirms that the schip- eligible children and their family members who give up esi have relatively poor healththe second paper investigates older taxpayers' response to the taxation of social security benefits in two dimensions income responses and social security claiming decisions using a nonparametric graphical methodology and a panel of administrative data from individual incometax and information returns social security benefits are taxed under a complex regime that raises marginal effective tax rates by up to 85 percent which could discourage labor supply of older workers while previous research found that the labor supply of older workers is significantly affected by the social security earnings test and the implicit taxes created by the social security benefit formula we find little evidence of response to the benefit taxation only single self-employed people show any evidence of reducing their modified adjusted gross income magi to avoid the tax and the response is much smaller and less precisely estimated than the response saez 2010 found to the phase-out of the earned income tax credit similarly while the taxation of benefits provides an incentive for many to delay claiming we find no evidence of such an effect overall the findings suggest that the taxation of benefits creates little distortion on older taxpayers if they completely understand the taxation or older taxpayers have little understanding of the rules governing social security benefit taxationthe last paper studies the effect of the social security earnings test on economic behavior of the elderly this paper provides a new piece of evidence to the relatively large literature of the earnings test which has found inconsistent labor market responses it builds upon the non- parametric methodology developed by saez 2010 to quantify the compensated elasticity of income with respect to the net-of-tax rate using bunching behavior discovered in income distributions draw the same administrative data as in the second paper we observe significant clustering to the left of the exempt amount for 63-64 year olds who are the candidates subjected to the earnings test the significant bunching translates into 004-009 in the compensated elasticity of income for the overall sample moreover both the bunching and the significant elasticity are driven by wage earners it reflects real behavioral responses rather than adjustments in the reporting process that is possible among the self-employed because wage income isreported by a third party to the tax authority and thus is less susceptible to manipulation than income from self-employment
