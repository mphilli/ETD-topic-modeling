intermediation digital environment virtual reference desk information-seeking the internet provides individuals with the opportunity to access unprecedented amounts of information on any given subject however there remain barriers to retrieving the best and most relevant documents the present study focuses on processes of resolving user versus technical issues information system users have traditionally relied on expert intermediaries for resolving problems face-to-face encounters have been the traditional form of human-expert intermediation increasingly however information-provision services have begun to offer human-mediated information services through computer networks--especially the internet--recognizing the potential advantages in overcoming barriers of time and space in user-intermediary communications despite the likely increase in this trend into the future there remains at this point an inadequate understanding of the effectiveness of these systemsthe present study investigates intermediation in the context of an asynchronous text-based computer-mediated medium such as e-mail and web-forms the goal of the research is in describing and gaining a further understanding of the processes of intermediation the main objectives are to identify the factors that might affect digital intermediation and to investigate how and under what circumstances these factors might affect digital intermediation the research takes the form of an exploratory case study of a hospital library information service the overall approach is naturalistic grounded theory provides a framework for data analysis in order to elicit a rich and fully informed accounting of the phenomenon under investigation the researcher interprets and relates the diverse human perspectives of the intermediaries the users and the researcher herself this provides a basis for highlighting potentially conflicting as well as corroborating evidencethe study contributes at both the conceptual and practical levels to an overall understanding of digital intermediation by producing a descriptive framework of analysis nine categories of factors potentially affecting digital intermediation are identified these factors form three broad aspects of digital intermediation media use question negotiation and personal communication preference the researcher also proposes directions for future research in the area of reference intermediation in a digital environment
