anticancer drug delivery gold nanoparticles gold nanoparticles aunp are excellent platforms for the delivery of chemotherapy drugs they are biocompatible their surface can be easily modified with ligands and they are readily taken up by cells in this work dna-functionalized gold nanoparticles aunp were developed as delivery vehicles for the clinically used anticancer drugs doxorubicin dox and actinomycin d actd each vehicle contains a tailorable number of dna duplexes typically 60 each possessing three high-affinity sequences for intercalation drug binding was evaluated by measuring changes to dna melting temperature tm particle hydrodynamic diameter dh and aunp surface plasmon resonance wavelength spr as a function of drug loading these studies demonstrated that dox intercalates at its high-affinity sequence bound at the aunp and that actd exhibits relatively weaker binding to its preferred sequence the binding constant k and drug dissociation rate constant  were shown to be enhanced in dox-vehicle binding compared to dox-calf thymus binding but no such effect was noted in the actd system cytotoxicity toward neuroblastoma cells was similar for each vehicle compared to the corresponding free drug dox or actda second generation of vehicles was developed to overcome potential limitations of the initial design first the vehicle was functionalized with folic acid fa to enable cancer cell targeting and to enhance cytotoxicity fa-modified vehicles were synthesized and extensively characterized a second modification to the vehicle involved functionalization with a temperature-responsive pnipaam-co-paam polymer p to improve the kinetic and equilibrium properties of drug release by sterically impeding the release of drug from surface bound dna at physiological temperature the k doubled for the p-modified vehicle the vehicle was also functionalized with polyethylene glycol peg to enable evasion of the mononuclear phagocyte system mps confocal microscopy studies showed moderate dox uptake for the first generation vehicle with little dox located in the nucleus in contrast dox uptake was significantly enhanced for vehicles modified with fa p and both neuroblastoma cell culture studies showed 5-fold enhanced cytotoxicity for the p-modified vehicle relative to dox presumably due to an increase in k cytotoxicity was enhanced 12-fold for vehicles with low to moderate fa loading demonstrating that there may be an optimal fa loading to achieve targeting peg functionalization did not affect cell growth finally the cytotoxicity of vehicles co-functionalized with both fa and p was enhanced 10-fold making it the most cytotoxic vehicle investigatedin another class of studies the gravitational sedimentation of citrate- and ascorbate-capped spherical aunp was investigated by measuring the absorption-vs-time trend produced as the particles slowly sediment for comparison theoretical sedimentation curves were generated using the mason-weaver sedimentation-diffusion equation this was done by solving the equation for various particle diameters and weighting the solution with the tem histogram and the size-dependent extinction coefficients for particles having average aunp core diameters of 121  06 650  52 and 825  52 nm very good agreement existed between the theoretical and observed sedimentation curves size histograms were also generated based on the measured sedimentation data
