authentication cognitive radio communication system mimo software-defined radio wireless communication this dissertation is composed of three parts airborne multi input multi output mimo communications physical layer authentication and software radio design for darpa spectrum challenge  a common theme for the three distinct problems is the system perspective that we have adopted throughout this dissertation instead of considering isolated issues within these problems we have provided a holistic design approach to the three problems and have implemented all three systems using the gnu radiousrp universal software radio peripheral platformin the first part we develop a mimo communication system for airborne platforms mimo communication has long been considered to be suitable only for environment that is rich in scatterers  this unfortunately is not the case for airborne platforms however this lack of scattering can be compensated by the large aperture of the airborne mimo platform this is corroborated by our careful analysis using real measurement data our analysis of the airborne mimo channels leads  to the development of a variable rate mimo transceiver architecture  this architecture is numerically shown to improve the bit error rate ber over conventional transceiver architectures that are developed for rich scattering environments  a software radio based mimo system is then implemented to demonstrate experimentally the efficacy of the developed architecturein the second part we develop a physical layer authentication scheme as a counter measure to primary user emulation attack puea in cognitive radio cr networks in this attack a malicious user emulates the signal characteristics of the primary user pu when it is silent which prevents unsuspecting secondary user su from utilizing the network the developed physical layer authentication is based on embedding cryptographic hash signatures referred to as authentication tags within pu's signal constellations  the embedding is performed such that the legacy receivers are not affected  we analyze the scheme using the fast fading rayleigh channel model and  present an optimal scheme to embed signals in pu's constellations which minimizes the tag ber  experimental results are obtained that corroborate our theoretical claims thereby establish that reliable authentication can be achieved without sacrificing signal quality at the primary receiversin the final part we describe in detail our design of software radios developed as part of the darpa spectrum challenge dsc a year long competition that started in january 2013 and concluded in march 2014 with the final tournament held in arlington va at the darpa headquarter dsc was comprised of two tournaments competitive and cooperative  in the competitive mode two radio pairs each composed of a transmitter and a receiver are pitted against each other to transmit the most amount of data error-free while operating concurrently in the same frequency band  in the cooperative mode three radio pairs have to share a frequency band in a cooperative manner wherein the goal is to maximize the throughput of all the three pairs  we describe the design of our software radio system that integrates some key technologies crucial in operating in an environment that does not allow user coordination and spectrum pre-planning including spectrum sensing adaptive transmission both in spectrum utilization and transmission rate opportunistic jamming and sliding window feedback the developed radio is robust in the presence of unknown interference and achieves the desired balance between throughput and reliability in an uncoordinated transmission environment
