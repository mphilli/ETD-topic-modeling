agency citizenship identification documents identity transgender at the heart of this project is an analysis of how people who gender transition broadly known by and through the term transgender determine and achieve recognition and belonging  two fundamental aspects of personhood and citizenship gender transition processes uniquely unfold along the gender binary in some cases reinforcing andor resisting it ones gender transition ultimately influences their decisions to legally amendment aspects of their identity currently the united states does not have a unified policy across federal state and local governance that enables name and sex designation changes on identification documents ids and personal records given this multi-scalar character of us id governance and the use of binary sex designations amending ids and records to achieve transrecognition and transbelonging is neither singular nor permanent processes rather they involve ongoing articulations and encounters that require navigating a multitude of social and structural factorsthis dissertation project uses an online survey n882 and semi-structured interviews n50 to investigate three broad research questions 1 do individual idrecord amendment decisions vary among transpeople 2 in what ways do multi-scalar us policies produce fragmented citizenship recognition 3 how do transpeople navigate and manage these policies and the fragmentation they create this project concerns the overall experience of transgender people and also engages in a comparative analysis of two groups of transpeople the analytic categories i create include transnormative which represents participants who identify within the gender binary eg man or woman and transqueer which represents participants who identify outside of or in resistance to the binary eg genderqueer or part-time in either gender these distinct categories illuminate the uniqueness and similarities among and between transpeople according to their attitudes experiences and the outcomes of managing the assemblage of idsresults demonstrate that transgender people overall are invested in practices that enable recognition and belonging especially via pronouns names sex categorization and photographs yet there are multiple pathways in which recognition and belonging are achieved broadly the transnormative group invests in the notion and institutional processes of alignment  aligning their gender embodiment pronouns names and sex designations to most often reflect the gender binary the transqueer group invests in practices of authentic representation that purposefully challenge the binary and also point out the impossibility as state designations do not offer options beyond m or fmy work engages the concept of fragmented citizenship by focusing on how inconsistencies across federal state and local jurisdictions disrupt linked technologies of recognition  particularly through identification documents fragmented citizenship is also created through social interactions within and across spaces transrecognition and trans belonging are dependent on agents interpretation of the incongruence between gender embodied identity and identity markers on ids the experience of fragmented citizenship leads transpeople to practice distinctive navigation and management strategies for example the transnormative group use ids that portray most up-to-date photographs carry cash instead of credit cards and de-gender ids while the transqueer group intentionally seek to disrupt gender attribution and categorization processesi argue that the effect of multi-scalar and multi-spatial fragmented citizenship produces a kind of precarious citizenship which temporarily or more permanently suspends or expels one from citizenship practices eg education employment travel consumption etc particular dimensions of precarity are shaped in part by ones orientation toward or away from the gender binary ones orientation influences transition-related decisions and the types of amendments desired and made as well as prioritizing the specific ids to amend despite the haunting effects of both fragmented and precarious citizenship transgender people are not passive but rather actively pursue recognition and forms of belonging given their social positions and contexts this research contributes to the fields of sociology citizenship studies and critical trans studies by situating individual agentic desires of recognition and belonging in relation to social processes and institutional power
