input types sensitivity analysis neural network partially connected in this dissertation we introduce methods for identifying input types and for determining an input ranking via sensitivity analysis for input-output mapping iom problems fully connected neural networks fcnns have been commonly used as a matter of course since they usually do not need a priori information about data because of the black-box style of training method fcnns may have unnecessary connections between input layers and hidden layers that can cause expensive computation and take longer for training due to the complex internal connections we introduce a method to develop partially connected neural networks pcnns by removing unnecessary connections in fcnns these pcnns perform almost as well as fcnns and in some cases they yield an even better performance they are structured by identifying input types its that to our best knowledge had not thus far been studiedwe identify its by analyzing the input sensitivity changes due to amplification of one input by a specific amount of the ratio of the input at a time we present a mathematical formulation of the identification of its that provides regularity in sensitivity changes of inputs according to the its for instance uncoupled inputs are not affected by the amplification of other inputs but coupled inputs are mutually affected by the amplification of any one of themin feedforward neural networks all inputs contribute to a greater or lesser extent when calculating the outputs therefore inputs may be ordered from the greatest contributor to the least we present a new method of determining the input ranking of three-layered pcnns in order to solve several issues that arose from examining related literature specifically the sensitivity of an input is dependent on the magnitude of other inputs thus the actual ranking becomes obscure also some methods require a large number of neurons in the hidden layer in order to obtain a statistical input ranking that represents the entire input spaceseveral examples simulated ones as well as those with real data namely blood pressure estimation which inspired us to develop our methods are given to demonstrate how well our methods work
