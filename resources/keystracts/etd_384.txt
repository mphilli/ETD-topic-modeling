 part i  synthesis and characterization of novel metal-citrate complexes and the investigation of metal-citrate transporters in gram-positive bacteriaabstractsyntheses of new barium cadmium calcium cobalt iron lead magnesium manganese nickel and strontium citrate complexes have been attempted using different methods such as room temperature slow evaporation and hydrothermal reactions to create new metal-citrate complexes  crystallizations were conducted under conditions varying metal and ligand concentrations solution ph temperature solvents and the presence of coligands  all structures of crystals obtained were characterized by x-ray crystallography  a novel lead-citrate complex was synthesized with a formula of na[pb5c6h5o73c6h6o7h2o] 8h2o  the structure is two-dimensional with five unique lead sites and four unique citrate ligands  three of the citrates exhibit three deprotonated carboxylates and one of them exhibit only two deprotonated carboxylates  to study the metal-citrate uptake in escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis radioflux assays were performed using citrate that was radiolabeled with 14cpart ii  synthesis and characterization of novel bifunctional single amino acid chelates saac for nuclear imagingabstract99mtci and rei complexes can be used to visualize various diseases by linking the radioactive metal cation to biologically active molecules  one type of bifunctional chelator is the single amino acid chelates saacs which can be effectively coordinated to the reco3 core through the chelating terminus  the other terminus can be used to fuse the saac into a variety of different peptides or biomolecules  based on these strategies syntheses of various saac ligands were investigated  all structures of crystals obtained were characterized by x-ray crystallography  a novel saacq-zn complex was synthesized using an optimized direct reductive alkylation method  additionally fluorescence and uv-vis studies were done on rei-saac compounds sent from collaborators
