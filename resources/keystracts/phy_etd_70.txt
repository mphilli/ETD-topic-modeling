thin films metalorganic chemical vapor deposition the deposition of metal thin films can be undertaken using volatile organometallic complexes metal-organic chemical vapor deposition has a number of potential advantages over conventional chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy technologies and a number of novel thin film materials can be made from organometallic compounds despite widespread use of mocvd little systematic work has been done to evaluate new source complexes thermodynamic studies are particularly important since these factors control whether the compound will decompose in such a way as to give a desired coating with low levels of contamination plasma- pyrolytic- and photolytic-assisted decomposition of organometallic complexes has been undertaken to make a variety of metal thin filmsin this work we have used pdc5hb5c3h5 to deposit pd coc5h52 to deposit co nic5h52 to deposit ni and cro3 or crco6 combined with o2 to deposit cro2 we then made coni and copd multilayers by laser photolysis multilayers have been deposited with a variety of compositions to verify dependence of the saturation magnetization on the composition the films were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy x-ray electron spectroscopy and auger electron spectroscopy as well as magneto-optic kerr effect moke torque magnetometer and vibrating-sample magnetometer vsm several conclusions can be drawn relating the thermodynamics with the outcome of attempting to make coatings the thermodynamic studies discussed herein are seen to give some prediction of contamination levels and coating feasibility with various organometallic compounds
