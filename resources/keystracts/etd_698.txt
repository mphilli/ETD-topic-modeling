national defense public administration public procurement the following dissertation presents three essays on the theory and empirics of public procurementthe process by which government defines its needs for goods and services and acquires them using contracts the objective of this dissertation is to address three unresolved questions in the literature regarding how the characteristics of products governments procure and the environments in which they are bought and sold shape government and non-governmental actors decision making at different points in the procurement processthe first essay develops an expanded theory of governments decision to directly deliver public servicessocial welfare energy utilities select forms of security provision and other services for citizensor contract out these responsibilities to third parties the essay takes as its point departure that transaction cost economicsthe theory that a product is made or bought based on the ease or difficulty with which it can be defined produced and exchanged via a contractdoes not adequately account for the environmental context within which governments select among alternative service delivery modes the essay rectifies this deficiency by drawing on resource dependence theory a complementary theory arguing that the make-or-buy decision turns on the nature of the public service marketplace the number of alternative sellers with which a government can do business and the amount of revenue sellers derive from this government vis--vis their other customers the argument is that combined these factors shape the degree of power government can exercise in a contracting relationship directly influencing the choice to make or buy a service as well as moderating the impact of service-specific characteristics this argument is specified in a set of hypotheses and a model for testing in future empirical researchthe second essay examines how the characteristics of products government chooses to buy rather than make influence competition among sellers vying for its business drawing from transaction cost economics the essay argues product complexitydefined and operationalized in terms of asset specificity or the degree of relationship-specific physical and human capital investments required to produce and deliver a productis a key determinant of competition more specifically the essay argues i at higher levels of complexity and thus of asset specificity sellers may deem the risks of doing business with the government as too high to warrant submitting a bid but ii while lower levels of complexity may decrease these risks they may also discourage competition by creating a collective action dilemma for a simpler product individual sellers may not submit a bid because they believe the competition will be too intense and their probability of winning too low this reasoning points to two effectsa project risk effect simpler products invite more bids and a win probability effect simpler products invite less bidsand implies competing hypotheses for how complexity influences competition the essay presents an econometric test of these hypotheses using a sample of information technology procurements drawn from us procurement federal data finding that the effects mostly offset one another the effects likely operate with greater force in one direction or another in larger program-based procurements eg of major weapons or information systems that can span many years and involve multiple individual contracts for development production maintenance and upgrades thus a more complete theoretical story that links complexity and competition would likely need to make its propositions contingent on the depth and duration of the underlying business relationship as well as the nature of the product being procuredthe third essay examines the conditions under which government adopts and implements alternative strategies to procure products after it has selected and awarded its business to one from a competing set of sellers specifically the essay examines the conditions under which government implements a knowledge-based procurement strategy predicated on incremental delivery of product capabilities and a sequential approach to product development and production typically seen as a best practice or a strategy predicated on delivering product capabilities in a single-step fashion and using a concurrent approach to development and production activities the essay starts from the observation that procurements executed in accordance with knowledge-based principles consistently feature strong leadershipindividuals purported to be pivotal in ensuring procurements adhere to a strategy anchored in knowledgeand posits that leader commitment influences adoption of the knowledge-based approach through a credible commitment mechanism in essence tenured leaders serve an advocacy role for the procurements they oversee ensuring the procurements receive sufficient support and protecting them from policymakers wishing to commit resources to other projects including those for which failure to follow a knowledge-based strategy could invite future problems but at least in the short-run appear that they will take less time and provide more capability in this way sustained leadership provides teams tasked with managing procurements incentives to stay the course maintaining adherence to a knowledge-based strategy pursuing modest capability objectives and taking the time necessary for sequential development and production the essay samples and examines a set of four successfully executed united states weapon system procurements to probe the plausibility of the credible commitment mechanism finding and presenting evidence that leaders do influence employment of knowledge-based strategies in part through this channel
