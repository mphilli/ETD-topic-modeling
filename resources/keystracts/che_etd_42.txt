oxovanadium organodiphosphonate triazolate metal-organic framework microporosity photoluminescence magnetism this research work encompasses the detailed investigation of the design and synthesis of hybrid organic-inorganic materials involving the oxovanadium diphosphonate system and the mi ii124-triazolate system in order to expand our understanding of the principles which render the chemistry of hybrid organic-inorganic materials more controllable and predictable in addition this research investigates the development of properties in these classes of compounds furthermore the hydrothermal reaction conditions such as stoichiometry temperature ph and fill volume influence the product identityin an attempt to elaborate the structural systematics of these materials we have investigated the oxovanadium organodiphosphonate system focusing on a number of variables specifically variations in tether length of  -alkyldiphosphonates the introduction of organic or metal complex cations and the incorporation of fluoride anions into the v-p-o substructurein order to explore the structural consequences of diverse anions on materials of the miiitriazoleanion system for m  cui cuii znii and cdii numerous novel phases were prepared and their properties studied we have described the exploitation of hydrothermal synthesis in the preparation of these metal-triazolates with complex framework structures photoluminescent properties microporosity and unusual magnetic properties
