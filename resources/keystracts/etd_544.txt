cessation pain pain-related anxiety smoking tobacco pain-related anxiety has been positively associated with tobacco dependence smoking motives self-reported barriers to smoking cessation and expectancies for negative affect reduction via smoking although emerging research suggests that pain-related anxiety may play a role in the maintenance of tobacco dependence no previous work has examined pain-related anxiety as a predictor of smoking cessation outcomes the goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis that pain-related anxiety would predict early lapse and relapse to cigarette smoking among a sample of 55 daily tobacco smokers who participated in an unaided cessation attempt ie without psychosocial or pharmacological intervention pain-related anxiety was assessed at baseline using the pass-20 which yields a total score that ranges from 0-100 number of days to early lapse ie any instance of smoking during the first 14 days post-quit and early relapse ie 7 consecutive days of smoking that began during the first 28 days post-quit were assessed using timeline follow-back procedures cox regression analyses indicated that pain-related anxiety was a significant predictor of both early smoking lapse and relapse such that for every one point increase on the pass-20 the risk of early lapse increased by 37 and the risk of early relapse increased by 36 these effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by tobacco dependence past four-week pain severity anxiety sensitivity and the presence of current axis i psychopathology kaplan-meier survival analyses further revealed that among early lapsers greater pain-related anxiety predicted a more rapid trajectory to lapse pain-related anxiety was also shown to be a significant predictor of early lapse when the sample was limited to smokers who endorsed past four-week pain these findings lend support to the notion that pain-related anxiety may contribute to the maintenance of tobacco dependence among smokers who experience varying levels of pain intensity
