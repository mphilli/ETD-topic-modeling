fat metabolism fructose hyperlipidemia insulin physical activity purpose the overall aim of this study was to examine the effects of a high-fructose diet on postprandial lipemia and hormones associated with glucose control during periods of altered physical activity methods twenty-two recreationally active males and females participated in this randomized cross-over design study age 212  06 years bmi 226  06 kgm2 subjects ingested 75 g of fructose for 14 days during a period of high physical activity fractive 12500 stepsday and a period of low physical activity frinactive 4500 stepsday prior to and following the 2 wk loading period a fructose-rich meal challenge was administered 45 carbohydrate [25 fructose] 40 fat and 15 protein blood was sampled at baseline and for 6 h after the meal and analyzed for triglycerides tg very-low density lipoproteins vldl c-reactive protein crp tumor necrosis factor-a tnf-a interleukin-6 il-6 glucagon-like peptide 1 glp-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide gip c- peptide glucose and insulin concentrations area under the curve auc and absolute change from peak to baseline concentrations  peak were calculated to quantify the postprandial responses results tg vldl and il-6 significantly increased in response to the frinactive intervention p005 while gip insulin c-peptide and glp-1 males only significantly decreased in response to the fractive intervention p005 no changes occurred with glucose tnf-a and crp concentrations for either intervention p005 conclusions when an inactive lifestyle is adopted for two weeks while consuming a high fructose diet postprandial lipidemia and low grade inflammation occurs in contrast two weeks of increased physical activity induces positive changes in hormones associated with glucose control in order to attenuate the deleterious effects of the fructose-rich diet
