sanitation microorganisms in waste treatment bacteria in wastewater treatment activated sludge process the objective of this study was to obtain mathematical expressions to describe predator-prey relationships in a continuous flow culture the resulting differential equations were tested in an experimental program using tetrahymena pyriformis w as a predator and aerobacter areogenes as a host organism the results should be of interest to those concerned with biological waste treatment processes--preface
