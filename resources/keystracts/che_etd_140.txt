aromaticity monocyclic planar molecule delocalization energy huckel's 4n2 theory of aromaticity has long been regarded as an important milestone in organic chemistry his well known 4n2 rule states that a moncyclic planar molecule containing 4n2 -pi electrons where n is zero of an integer will have all of its bonding molecular orbitals occupied and all of its anti-bonding molecular orbitals vacant further this stable arrangement in predicted to possess a higher delocalization energy than its iso-pi-electronic acyclic counterpart a number of systems theoretically capable of satisfying these demands have been studied in recent years
