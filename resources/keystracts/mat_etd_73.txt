depth multivariate nonparametric ranking and selection in a ranking and selection problem a collection of k populations is given which follow some partially unknown probability distributions the problem is to select the best of the k populations where best is well defined in terms of some unknown population parameter in many univariate parametric and nonparamentric settings solutions to these ranking and selection problems exist in the multivariate case only parametric solutions have been developed we have developed several methods for solving nonparametric multivariate ranking and selection problems the problems considered allow an experimenter to select the best populations based on nonparametric notions of dispersion location and distribution for the first two problems we use tukey's halfspace depth to define these notions in the last problem we make use of a multivariate version of the kolmogorov-smirnov statistic for making selections
