signal detection  space-time adaptive processing stap we are primarily interested in radar signal detection using stap technique in a nonhomogeneous noise background which has unknown covariance information we should know that nonhomogeneous data once joined to the covariance matrix estimation will cause the degradation of stap performance to this end the purpose of this dissertation is to find solutions to reduce the stap performance degradation caused by the nonhomogeneous datawe first discuss what nonhomogeneity is and its effects on stap nonhomogeneity will cause the scnr loss via the filtering and the cfar loss via the estimation of the threshold these two losses are derived from a bad covariance matrix estimation because the weighting vector of stap is \bf wu\bf\ r\bf\sp-1s thus the covariance matrix estimation plays a decisive role regarding the reduction of the stap performance degradationwe introduce two methods sample selection and data weighting to handle nonhomogeneous data sample selection is a pre-stap data processor in which we aim at screening the nonhomogeneous data before forming the covariance matrix in other words we choose only the likely homogeneous data to gain a better covariance matrix estimation definitely sample selection is appropriate for discrete type nonhomogeneitythe covariance matrix estimation via the maximum likelihood estimate mle results in an equal weighting of all sample data which is not an especially effective approach to control non iid nonhomogeneous data rather we suggest a weighted average covariance matrix estimation in which we weight the likely nonhomogeneous data with a smaller weighting than that of the likely homogeneous data we thereby show that both the scnr and the cfar losses under the data weighting situation can be reducedmoreover we must test all secondary data and thus know their characteristics before we can apply either a sample selection or a data weighting or a combination of both to the data set indeed choosing a proper test algorithm for nonhomogeneity detection is critical consequently we also include a comparison of three cfar embedded algorithms glr msmi and t\sp2 in this dissertation
