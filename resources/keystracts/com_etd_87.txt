australia canada climate change news coverage politics united states this study compares newspaper coverage of climate change and  global warming during the national elections in australia canada and the us  during 2007 and 2008 using a census of newspaper coverage and in-depth  interviews with reporters editors and columnists in the three countries the  study confirmed the findings of earlier studies that the political agenda shapes  the news agenda when it comes to climate change coverage however the study did  find that coverage of general climate change stories continued during the  election campaign periods in the three countries reporters who cover either  politics or environmental issues or both found it difficult to make the  connection in their stories between climate change concerns and the political  debate even in the case of the 2007 australian and 2008 canadian elections  where climate change policy was a major issue these problems highlight the need  for newspapers to seriously reconsider how they approach coverage of climate  change in general and in the political context by making more connections to  related stories outside of the geographic area that they serve
