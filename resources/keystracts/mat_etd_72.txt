convex functions extension of pluricomplex green functions pluricomplex green functions plurisubharmonic functions polyradial functions reinhardt domains in 1985 klimek introduced an extremal plurisubharmonic function on bounded domains in cn that generalizes the green's function of one variable this function is called the pluricomplex green function of  with logarithmic pole at a and is denoted by ga the aim of this thesis was to investigate the extension properties of ga     let 0 be a bounded domain of cn and e be a compact subset of 0 such that    0 e is connected in general ga cannot be extended as a pluricomplex green function to any subdomain of 0 that is strictly larger that  in this thesis it was proved that if 0 is a pseudoconvex bounded complete reinhardt domain in cn and e is a strictly logarithmically convex reinhardt compact subset of 0 that does not contain 0 and does not intersect the coordinate axes there exists a subdomain tilde of 0 strictly larger that  such that g z0  gtilde z0 for any z in  it was also shown that in c2 one can omit the condition that e does not intersect the coordinate axes     the methods required to prove the results heavily use the relation between the plurisubharmonicity of poyradial functions on reinhardt domains and convexity of related functions special classes of convex functions were introduced and discussed for this purpose these methods were also used to discuss the extension properties of the pluricomplex green functions when 0 is equal to unit the bidisk in c2 and in that case a complete solution of the problem was given
