expert conceptualizations instructional design deep assessment complex problem-solving in simple well-structured problem solving assessment is straight-forward since there is usually a single correct answer to such problems in the case of complex ill-structured problems such as instructional design problems typically performance on actual problems while generally desirable for determining actual level of expertise is less appropriate since these often require teams of experts and specialists interacting over a period of months to develop an actual solution furthermore it is hard to evaluate individual students on the basis of their actual performances since such problems do not have standard 'correct' responsesgiven this situation the motivation underlying this study was the lack of a reliable assessment method to determine progress in higher-order learning in situations involving complex and ill-structured problems one may argue that differences in performance-outcomes imply domain experts conceptualize ill-structured problems differently another alternative explanation may be that experts do conceptualize a given problem similarly but there are other factors that lead to different performance-outcomes of experts in this case expert problem conceptualizations could be used as a basis for assessmentin this direction this study aimed at 1 exploring the processes underlying complex ill-structured problem solving of instructional design experts to investigate whether expert instructional designers exhibit recognizable patterns in their conceptualizations of a given instructional design problem and 2 investigating the utility of annotated causal representations for eliciting problem conceptualizations of experts in a complex ill-structured problem domain such as instructional designthe results of this study suggested that annotated causal representations are useful in eliciting problem conceptualizations of individuals and identifying their relative levels of expertise in addition expert instructional designers exhibited recognizable patterns in their conceptualizations of the given instructional design problem despite these similarities however each expert offered different solution approaches for the given problem this was explained by the differences in the processes underlying well-structured and complex ill-structured problem solving unlike in well-structured problem solving problem conceptualization and problem solution are not two separate activities in ill-structured problem solving rather they are intimately connected they complete each other and develop in parallel
