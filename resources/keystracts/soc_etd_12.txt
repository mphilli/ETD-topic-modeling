labor policy china rural-urban migrants migrants nanjing social process in my study i interviewed rural-urban migrants in a chinese city nanjing i investigated their personal experiences and thoughts and i tried to understand why they had these experiences and developed these thoughts using the interviews some socioeconomic data some data from the census and surveys done by other researchers i used this information to discuss whether rural-urban migration in china may cause some social changesthe economy is the most important element that causes rural-urban migration in any country in addition in china governmental policies are extremely influential they create systematic inequality between rural and urban areas and create a split or segmented labor market based on ruralurban status within a city this in turn structures the relations between urbanites and rural migrants in the city both preventing meaningful political alliances between poor rural and urban workers in the city and causing rural workers to internalize their inferior status meanwhile the chinese traditional culture strongly affects rural people's conception about their status and fate as a result they tend to accept this social inequality the rural migrants maintain an orientation towards their rural home and focus on making money and bringing it back to their rural families they claim to have no interest in politicsin western academic circles and public media rural-urban migrants in china are regarded as a group of suppressed and desperate people who threaten the reign of ccp chinese communist party however my study shows that these people are neither a united group nor desperate so at the present time they do not threaten the current regime
