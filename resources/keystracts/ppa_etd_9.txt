knowledge networks e-government local governments korea social networks public management the purpose of this research is to explore knowledge networks for e-government services a primary research question is what are the knowledge network conditions under which government organizations deliver high-performance of e-government services to answer this question i take a social network perspective to examine knowledge networks for providing e-government services in a local government setting i designed a comparative case study where i explored knowledge networks for the online parking services of two korean local governments the findings of the first study emphasize that knowledge sharing opportunity matters for the perceived e-government effectiveness network actors with better opportunity to access knowledge possessed by others are found to perceive greater e-government effectiveness through the analysis of the knowledge networks of the two local governments i found that e-government performance is likely to be enhanced 1 when local governments allocate strong ties with external stakeholders such as it vendors and upper level government organizations to explore novel knowledge for e-government services 2 at the same time they maintain strong ties among internal stakeholders to exploit their knowledge residing organization units 3 when cross-unit knowledge sharing--between program and it units in particular--emerges from denser e-government knowledge networks 4 when knowledge networks are decentralized across network actors and 5  when cross-unit boundary spanners are embedded in denser local knowledge networks and there are strong ties among their contacts as well as between cross-unit boundary spanners and their contacts
