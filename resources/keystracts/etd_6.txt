hydrothermal synthesis metal-organic frameworks transition metals x-ray crystallography this work encompasses detailed investigations of the synthesis and structures of transition metal complexes which contain xylyldiphosphonate or organoarsonate ligands the xylyldiphosphonate families of materials which were examined were the metalii series of cu ni co mn cd and zn with an addition of an organo-nitrogen chelate with success in these families of materials a secondary metal of vanadium or molybdenum was added to these metalii systems to increase the complexity of the structure produced for the organoarsonate series of compounds the chemistry of the mometaliiorganoarsonateorgano-nitrogen chelate family of materials was expanded upon and preliminary studies were conducted into the vmetaliiorganoarsonateorgano-nitrogen chelate group of materialsthe analysis of a number of structural determinants in the xylyldiphosphonate family of compounds aims to expand upon the current knowledge of metal-diphosphonate chemistry we have focused on variables such as the xylyldiphosphonate ligand used- whether 14- 13- or 12-xylyldiphosphonate furthermore we have varied the denticity and size of the organo-nitrogen co-ligand we have also investigated the incorporation of fluoride into the vanadium and molybdenum series of compounds through our examination of these systems we have discovered that all possible dimensionalities are represented in the xylyldiphosphonate series of compounds we postulate that the unique flexibility of the xylyldiphosphonate ligands allows a number of unique structures to be producedin expanding upon the organoarsonate family of materials we have discovered the preferences for molecular structures in the mometaliiorganoarsonateorgano-nitrogen chelate family of materials in our preliminary studies of the vanadium group of materials a one-dimensional chain was produced and with a minor change in reaction conditions we saw a drastic structural change which yielded a mixed-dimensional structure consisting of clusters and chains we conclude that minor changes in reaction conditions can lead to large structural changes with the use of hydrothermal synthesis
