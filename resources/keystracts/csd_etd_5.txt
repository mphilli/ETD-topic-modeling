vocal folds vowel production glottal airflow this study examined the minimum range of variability in vocal fold vibration during syllables as measured from glottal airflow repeated samples were taken from adults with healthy vocal folds four times within two weeks and four consecutive trials within one day sources of extraneous variability were minimized by a controlling subglottal pressure b age-matching subjects c controlling time of sampling d taking menstrual cycle into account and e low-pass filtering rather than inverse filtering oral airfloweleven females and 11 age-matched males received medical exams to assess laryngeal health and vocal fold vibratory pattern to elicit 3 different modes of vibration subjects produced bap syllable strings at 5 8 and 12 cm h 2 o subglottal pressure p s  fm tape recordings were made of oral airflow collected with rothenberg mask subglottal pressure and electroglottograph signals data were digitized and low-pass filters extracted glottal airflow indices of variability were coefficient of variation cv in  and median absolute deviation mad dependent measures were fundamental frequency f 0  amplitude flow a minimum flow l mean flow m open quotient q o  and spectral balance ratio sbr ratio of the sum of harmonics above f 0 to that at f 0 ranked cv data across subjects and measures indicated that f0 had the smallest range of variability 06 and l the largest 101 f 0 most often had a small range of variability while l most often had a large range females had larger mad values than males for f 0  q o and sbr males for a l and m nonparametric statistical analyses revealed that magnitude of variability for l was not affected by sex of subject subglottal pressure level or time frame of testing while the magnitude of variability for a was affected by sex p s level and time frameconclusions include a selected measures of glottal airflow do not vary in the same manner by sex p s level or time frame b p s and time frame affect f 0  l and q o less than a m and sbr and c control of p s decreases variability
