academic intervention generalization performance feedback writing national assessments have indicated that a large number of students in the united states are underperforming in writing national center for education statistics 2012 persky daane  jin 2003  accordingly there is a clear need for research to identify appropriate interventions targeting writing  one intervention that has received empirical support is performance feedback van houten et al 1974 1975 1979  however few performance feedback studies have explicitly targeted generalization  the primary purpose of the current study was to examine the extent to which 116 third-grade students randomly assigned to a generalization programming n  39 performance feedback n  38 or practice-only condition n  39 demonstrated gains in writing fluency and were able to demonstrate stimulus and response generalization  it was hypothesized that a students in both intervention conditions would significantly outperform the practice-only condition in writing fluency growth and b students in the generalization programming condition would demonstrate stronger performance on measures of stimulus and response generalization as a result of explicit programming tactics targeting generalized skills along the sequence of the instructional hierarchy haring  eaton 1978  there was mixed support for the hypotheses as students in the performance feedback condition demonstrated statistically significant greater writing fluency growth in comparison to both the practice-only and generalization programming conditions  in comparison to students assigned to practice-only or performance feedback conditions students assigned to the generalization programming condition demonstrated significantly greater performance on a measure of response generalization however there were no differences between the conditions on a measure of stimulus generalization
