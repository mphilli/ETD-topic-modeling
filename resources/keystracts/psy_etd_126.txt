modern test theory rasch model during the last twenty years what bock and wood 1971 have called modern test theory has slowly developed from the work of lord 1952 on the normal ogive model lazarsfeld 1959 on latent trait analysis and birnbaum 1958 and rasch 1960 on logistic models of test behavior each of these models is based on a hypothesized relationship between test responses and some hypothetical latent measure of ability as opposed to the traditional theory as presented by gulliksen 1950 which assumes observed scores are a linear combination of true and error components
