circuit optimization discrete optimization gate sizing lagrangian relaxation power minimization timing minimization   sizing has shown its impact on design automation of vlsi circuits at first the cost of the circuit is reduced by changing the transistorgate sizes widths circuit designers are able to size each transistorgate of the circuit in order to minimize the cost such as area and power consumption under timing constraints in the deep submicron era power dissipation has become one of the most important limiting factors for circuit designs hence designers seek to adjust the circuit parameters of supply voltage threshold voltage gate length and gate width in order to optimize the power-performance tradeoffs the most common way to size the parameters is to properly choose an associated library cell version of each gate in the circuit from the precharacterized cell library which has a limited number of cell versions available for each gate type therefore the sizing problems should be solved in the discrete domain simultaneously adjusting the circuit parameters allows one to gain the fine control of the cost and performance of the circuit designs however the problem size grows enormously when more parameters such as gate length threshold voltage and supply voltage are available for adjustmentin this dissertation an extreme fast discrete gate sizing heuristic is proposed for circuit performance optimization in addition a lagrangian method based discrete sizing algorithm is developed to solving the gate sizing problem furthermore the proposed discrete sizing algorithm can handle the more complicated power optimization problem with multiple leakage power reduction techniques applied simultaneously including threshold voltage assignment gate-length biasing and gate sizing finally another discrete gate sizing is proposed based on a surrogate lagrangian method which can achieve near optimal solutions while requiring significantly more computational time
