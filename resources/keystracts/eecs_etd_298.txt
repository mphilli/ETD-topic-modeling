fdtd single-field vector wave equation in this dissertation a set of general purpose single-field  finite-difference time-domain updating equations for solving electromagnetic  problems is derived the formulation uses a single-field expression for  full-wave solution this formulation can provide numerical results similar to  those obtained using the traditional formulation with less required computer  resourcestraditional finite-difference time-domain updating equations are  based on maxwell's curl equations whereas the single-field updating equations  used here are based on the vector wave equation general formulations are  derived for normal and oblique incidence plane wave cases for linear isotropic  homogeneous and non-dispersive as well as dispersive mediato compare the single-field updating equations with the  traditional ones two-dimensional transverse magnetic two-dimensional  transverse electric and one-dimensional electromagnetic problems are solved  fields generated by a current sheet and a filament electric current are  calculated for one and two-dimensional formulations respectively performance  analyses of the single-field formulation in terms of cpu time memory  requirement stability dispersion and accuracy are presented based on the  simulations of several two-dimensional problems excited by a filament of  electric current it was observed that the single-field method is more efficient  than the traditional one in terms of speed and memory requirementsone scattering problem consisting of three infinitely long  dielectric cylinders excited by an obliquely incident plane wave and another  scattering problem consisting of a point source exciting a dispersive sphere  utilizing lorentz-drude model are also formulated and analyzed the numerical  results obtained confirmed the validity and efficiency of the single-field  formulations
