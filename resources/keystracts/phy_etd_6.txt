electronic transport polyaniline films solar cells silicon heterostructures experimental studies of the electronic transport and optical absorption in polyaniline pani films and panisilicon heterostructure solar cells are reported most of the emeraldine salt pani films were prepared by spin-casting from commercially prepared acid-doped dispersions in xylene solution it was discovered that diluting these dispersions about tenfold with additional xylene reduced the conductivity of the pani films cast onto glass from 10 2  scm to 10 -4  scm or lower this dilution effect is probably a variation of the well-known effect of dispersion ph upon the doping level of emeraldine salt pani films the optical absorption measurements on films from dispersions with varying xylene dilution were also similar to those previously reported for films prepared from dispersions with varying phheterostructure solar cells were prepared by casting p -type pani films onto n-type crystalline silicon c-si and onto hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-sih ni structures the open-circuit voltages  v oc  of the cells measured under strong 05 wcm 2  white-light illumination probe the fermi levels of the pani films both the v oc measurements and temperature-dependent conductivity measurements on pani films support a fixed bandedge model for transport in this model the variations in the film conductivities are determined by varying fermi levels and electronic transport occurs at a fixed valence bandedge level energy and bandedge conductivity 200 scm we speculate that this bandedge is a mobility-edge these conclusions differ significantly from previous models based on hopping transport or polaron bandsfor the panisi cells we conclude that v oc values of 07 v or higher are possible in principle which would be of technological interest the measured v oc values saturated at about 05 v for the highest conductivity films spun from xylene dispersions high conductivity water-based dispersions yielded a lower saturated v oc  we speculate that an interface effect is limiting v oc  no saturation was found for pania-sih cells but the largest v oc values of around 07 v are not of great technological interest
