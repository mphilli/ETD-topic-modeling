universe anthropic principle cosmic fine-tuning discoveries in modern physics and big bang cosmology indicate that if either the initial conditions of the universe or the physical laws governing its development had differed even slightly life could never have developed it is for this reason that the universe is said to be fine-tuned for life i argue that cosmic fine-tuning which some want to dismiss as the way things just happen to be in fact needs to be explainedin chapter one i provide an overview of the evidence that the universe is fine-tuned for life in chapter two i present a set of sufficient conditions for a fact's needing to be explained the conditions are that the fact is improbable and that a tidy explanation of it is available a tidy explanation of a fact is considerably less improbable than that fact and makes the obtaining of that fact considerably less improbablechapters three four and five are devoted to showing that cosmic fine-tuning meets these conditions in chapter three i argue that the universe's being finely tuned for life can meaningfully be considered improbable in chapter four i claim that there is at least one tidy explanation of cosmic fine-tuning that the universe was created by some sort of extramundane designer in chapters four and five i respond to three objections the first is that the design hypothesis is ad hoc  the second is that we have no reason to believe a supernatural designer would prefer life-permitting cosmoi to other possible cosmoi and that our tendency to believe otherwise is the result of anthropocentrism the third is that the design hypothesis never buys us an explanatory advantage
