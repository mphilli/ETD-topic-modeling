motion estimation electrical engineering computer science the establishment of video compression standards and the extensive application of compression technology necessitate the consideration of a practical solution for real-time mpeg encoding due to the high computational requirements of the mpeg encoding algorithm hardware-based solutions are at the present time the only viable alternativesa detailed complexity analysis of the mpeg-2 main profile and main level encoding algorithm is performed in this work based upon this analysis the investigation of the internal structure of the state-of-the-art multimedia video processor mvp and the mapping of the encoding functions on the mvp an architecture for real-time encodingdecoding of the single constraint mpeg-2 syntax is developed a major feature of this architecture is its programmability a feature which may be utilized for other computationally extensive algorithmsthe encoding problem is a constrained optimization problem the results of statistical studies performed towards this end and the development of a new motion estimation algorithm are employed in developing a more feasible architecture for the mpeg-2 main profile and main level real-time encoding
