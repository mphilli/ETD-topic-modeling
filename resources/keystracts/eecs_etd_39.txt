security wireless sensor networks securing sensor networks which have extensive military applications is very challenging sensor networks are usually deployed in an untrusted environment hence homogeneity of nodes makes the system vulnerable to large scale security attacks because compromising one gives enough information to compromise other nodes diversifying sensor nodes in a network is a promising solution in this thesis three techniques for diversification are presentedthe first technique is for diversifying highly constrained sensor networks with known topology the constraints are based on nodes software and links this technique can be applied to sensor networks as well as general networksthe second technique is for diversifying communication links in a key predistribution scheme this technique works for dynamic networks in this scheme more keys are assigned among the nodes that have low security dependency than nodes with high security dependency without exceeding the maximum number of keys for each node or affecting the connectivity of the networkthe third technique is for protecting the keys in wireless sensor nodes by diversifying data and code segments this technique achieves diversity by obfuscating the keys in the data segment using a hash function for each bit that is different from one node to another then our random code obfuscation scheme is applied creating a new and different version of the code for each node that hides all critical information such as hashing parameterssimulation and directed implementation results are presented the results illustrate the advantages of these schemes over other schemes
