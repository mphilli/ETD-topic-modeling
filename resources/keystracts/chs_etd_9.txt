treatment integrity performance feedback goal setting negative reinforcement the current study examined the extent to which treatment integrity was increased and maintained for four teachers in their special education classroom settings as a result of goal setting performance feedback and negative reinforcement four teachers were trained to implement a behavioral intervention plan in order to address problem behavior exhibited by a student in their respective special education classrooms in one condition four teachers set a goal for student behavior and received daily written feedback about their respective student's performance goal settingperformance feedback in the second condition the same teachers received daily written feedback about student progress as well as their own accuracy in implementing an intervention and were be able to avoid meeting with a consultant to practice missed steps by implementing the intervention with 100 integrity performance feedbacknegative reinforcement treatment integrity increased for all four teachers in the performance feedbacknegative reinforcement condition with gains maintaining over time similar results were not consistently found in the goal settingperformance feedback condition results revealed a significant negative correlation between treatment integrity and student behavior for three teacher-student dyads implications for these findings as well as directions for future research are discussed
