educational policy reading instruction response to intervention rti school change transformative leadership the purpose of this study was to explore how individuals in one primary school enacted and understood a new mandate called response to intervention or rti  more specifically it asked  1 how was the rti mandate interpreted and realized by the school  2 in what ways was reading instruction addressed during rti implementation 3 how did individuals view their responsibilities and involvement with rtithis qualitative study was rooted in social constructionism berger  luckman 1966 burr 2003 a theory that views knowledge of reality as unfixed and shaped by the language and actions of individuals in contextualized situated perspectives  seventeen participants volunteered for this study which used in-depth interviews participant observations and locally created documents as data sources  data analysis also drew upon the notion of marginalization of students with learning differences beglieri bejoain broderick connor  valle 2011 ferri 2011 lalvani 2015 nordmann 2001 and bankss 2003 ideas about additive versus transformative approaches to educational changeanalysis of data sources revealed that response to intervention was enacted within and between existing school structures and practices in a way that can be described as additive banks 2003  that is some new components were added to what was already in place without a fundamental shift in the beliefs underlying existing structures and practices  approaches to reading instruction did not appear to change during response to intervention implementation in this school  it is argued that without changes to instruction there are unlikely to be changes in reading outcomes for students  this may begin to help explain the findings of a national study of rti effectiveness conducted by balu zhu doolittle schiller jenkins and gersten 2015  the authors of the large-scale study concluded that rti as implemented in the united states has yet to have positive effects and sometimes had negative effects on student reading achievementanalysis also revealed that despite response to interventions intent to reduce the placing of special education labels on children it was enacted in a way that created a new label  rti  an rti teacher was hired to deliver rti services to the rti students  this new labeling may be seen as stigmatizing thereby perpetuating the marginalization of some students who struggle with learning to read and undermining collective responsibility for the reading success of all students in schoolsthis study provides new insights about what happens when well-intended educational mandates come from the top down  it shows how such mandates may be socially constructed in actual schools with pre-existing underlying beliefs structures and practices that may be incongruent with the new initiative  this study points to a need for more up-close research that explores the enactment of educational mandates in schools  the findings also suggest a need for more specific guidance within legislation to support schools as they implement mandates and as a result have implications for teacher and administrator education and practice
