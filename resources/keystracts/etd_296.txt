drinking water hazards ion exchange natural water hazards trace metals i report the results of an evaluation on the factors that control the quality of potable water produced in domestic and other wells in the shallow sedimentary rock formations of the appalachian basin i collected 49 samples from the upper 120 meters of devonian to pennsylvanian aged bedrock between marcellus ny and state college pa and analyzed their bulk geochemical composition in particular i quantified the mobile and total metals for which there are health concerns related to unconventional gas exploitation in the appalachian basin fe mn sr ba as and pb measured bulk concentrations for several formations reached maximum concentrations of 65 ppm as 4900 ppm ba 63000 ppm fe 130 ppm ni and 68 ppm pbto assess the mobility of these metals in the subsurface i used a variation of the us geological survey field leaching test metals such as al zn and u potentially can be leached from aquifer rocks naturally under acidic conditions such as where pyrite might oxidize to above current allowable regulatory values for these metals 2 mgl 5 mgl and 003 mgl respectively from some of the clay-rich formations small percentages typically 1 of the bulk concentrations were mobilized into solution but were still sufficient to exceed current epa drinking water maximum contaminant levels mcl in many of the samples in total 74 of our samples exceeded mcl values for al 18 for as 6 for fe 12 for mn 98 for pb above mcl goal of 0 ppb and 70 for u above mcl goal of 0 ppbgroundwater analyses from both new york and pennsylvania show that natural ion exchange occurs along flow paths from ridge tops to valleys  i measured the total cation exchange capacity cec of the samples and observed that they do not span the expected values for illite-rich clays typically 10-40 milliequivalents100g commonly found in the appalachian basin instead 88 of the samples had cec values below 10 meq100g with only 1 sample above 20 meq100g i quantified the hypothetical ground water flow path lengths necessary for the observed cation exchange to occur along fracture planes by combining cec values with surface area measurements on three samples which ranged from 1032-1359 m2g these three estimates resulted in plausible flow path lengths of 2 km 3 km and 30 kmmany state and federal regulations do not require water from domestic wells or groundwater samples collected for metal analysis to be filtered i argue that these regulations expose residents to drinking water with turbidity caused by suspended minerals that have metals attached leading to total concentrations at or above the environmental protection agencys epa mcl levels i quantified the effects of turbid water at the epa mcl of 5 ntu and improper filtration of turbid groundwater samples at the epa mcl of 10 ntu on total metal concentrations used to trigger regulatory compliance related to possible contamination and health effectsalong with this broad scale study area i compared my geochemical results to the fiorentino ii 2015 study on a devonian outcrop 4 miles north of cortland ny to evaluate small-scale trace metal heterogeneity within a single stratigraphic section my regional collection of single data points at outcrops plotted within the 10th and 90th percentiles of the small-scale outcrop study together these two studies provide important information to determine the extent to which ground water might be naturally high in trace metal composition either because of geochemical conditions or entrainment of suspended material not removed prior to sampling
