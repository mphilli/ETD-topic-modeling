social sciences self-image congruence brand extension avatars this dissertation investigates the effect of self-image on brand-extension evaluation in the context where self-images are influenced by an avatar prior studies have demonstrated the positive effects of self-image congruence on brand evaluation the brand-extension literature has found that the congruency between the parent-brand and the extension influences the brand-extension evaluation with moderately incongruent extensions having a stronger effect than either highly incongruent or highly congruent extensions missing in the past research is the role of congruency in the self-imagebrand relationship within a brand-extension evaluation context the brand-extension evaluation literature seems to suggest that while evaluating a brand-extension the consumer's focus abandons the parent-brandconsumer relationship and shifts completely towards the parent-brandbrand-extension relationship thus this dissertation had two objectives the first objective was to confirm that consumers integrate self-image congruence into their brand-extension evaluation process and that this integration will affect their assessment of the brand-extension the second objective was to show that a consumer's perception of self-image congruence between the consumer and a particular brand can be altered via avatar while encountering brand-extensions onlinethe findings suggested that [1] avatars indeed influence a consumer's perception of self-image congruence when encountering brands in a digital environment furthermore there is a stronger effect when the products of the brand are typically consumed in a public manner compared to products that are privately consumed and [2] self-image congruence affects a consumer's evaluation of a brand-extension such that highly congruent and moderately incongruent extensions are evaluated evenly counter-arguing the traditional effects of the moderately-incongruent hypothesis the steady increase in the number of companies implementing user-controlled avatars in various media outlets eg - company websites videos games advergames and virtual worlds validates the managerial relevance of these findings
