panel data change point cross-sectional dependence lagrange multiplier test estimation this dissertation consists of three essays on testing for cross-sectional dependence and estimation of change points in panel data models the first two essays discuss two testing procedures of cross-sectional dependence in fixed effects panel data models in the first essay i propose a new test for cross-sectional dependence based on the frobenius norm of the sample covariance matrix of the within residuals in the second essay i develop a bias-corrected lagrange multiplier lm test for cross-sectional dependence in a fixed effects model in the final essay i discuss the estimation of change points in a panel data regression model and establish the consistency and rate of convergence of the change point estimatorthe first essay proposes a new test called the john test for cross-sectional dependence of the error terms in linear panel regression models different from pesaran's 2004 cd test and the bias-adjusted lm test pesaran et al 2008 the proposed test is based on a statistic for sphericity of a large dimensional covariance matrix developed by ledoit and wolf 2002 since the errors are unobservable in fixed effects panel models the within residuals are used i show that the effect of using the within residuals cannot be ignored asymptotically the limiting distribution of the proposed test statistic is derived the monte carlo simulations show that the size of the john test is very close to the nominal significance level in large panelsthe second essay discusses the lm test for cross-sectional dependence in fixed effects panel data models unlike testing for serial correlation in time series data breusch and pagan's 1980 lm test is not valid for testing cross-sectional dependence in panel data models since the test statistic diverges as the number of cross-sectional units increases thus a scaled version of lm test is proposed by pesaran 2004 however this test suffers from a big size distortion and cannot be applied directly in empirical research of panel data with large cross-sectional units as discussed by pesaran 2004 and pesaran ullah and yamagata 2008 this essay finds that in a fixed effects panel data model the scaled version of lm test exhibits an asymptotical bias which is a constant related to the numbers of cross-sectional units and the observations over time therefore a bias-corrected lm test is proposed and its limiting distribution is derived additionally its finite sample properties are examined and compared with the other tests for cross-sectional dependence using monte carlo simulationsthe third essay studies the phenomenon of structural change in panel data models it is a common feature that the processes of gdp inflation and interest rates are often vulnerable to political technological and supply shocks eg the current global financial crisis and the oil crisis in 1970s thus accurate estimation of the change point when the structural change occurs is essential to correct the potentially invalid statistical inference resulting from ignoring this phenomenon however the time series literature shows that the estimate of the change point is inconsistent picard 1985 yao 1987 bai 1994 bai 1997 bai and perron 1998 nevertheless in panel data models with many individuals this essay shows that the estimator of the common change point becomes consistent in addition the limiting distribution of the change point estimate in panels can be derived without the traditional shrinking break assumption
