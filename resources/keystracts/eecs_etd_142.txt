decorrelators log-likelihood ratio quantizer multiuser detection ds-cdma the conventional optimal detector for dscdma systems consists of a bank of matched filters this detector suffers from severe degradation if the interfering signal is not orthogonal to the desired one the optimum multiuser detection method is based on a maximum likelihood sequence detection formulation its intensive computational complexity makes this detector impractical a variety of sub-optimum detection methods have been proposed over the years such as decorrelating detection mmse detection successive interference cancellation detection and decision feed-back detection in addition coding techniques have been considered for improved performance such as convolutional coding and trellis-coded modulationthe goal of this dissertation is to develop improved suboptimal multiuser detection algorithms we concentrate on three distinct approaches to the multiuser detection problem one approach is based on the use of equi-correlated signature codes the proposed receiver for the equi-correlation-based multiuser communication ecbmc scheme has low computational complexity by using the equality of cross-correlations the proposed ecbmc scheme can completely eliminate multi-access interference in a synchronous single-path dscdma network system performance is independent of the number of active users the knowledge needed at the receiver is only the spreading sequences of the user being demodulated the scheme has been extended to include multipath situationsanother approach extends the decorrelator it is based on the fact that the decorrelator outputs corresponding to each user have different reliability these decorrelated signals for each user are first tested to determine whether or not a final decision can be made with high reliability for users with high reliability a hard decision is made at this stage for the remaining users a conditional quantization cq algorithm is employed before a decision is made significant performance enhancement can be achieved over the conventional decorrelator at the expense of a modest increase in computational complexitywe also present a multiuser detection scheme based on cell diversity for dscdma systems this scheme is employed when multiple base stations can detect the desired signals each cooperating base station computes the decision statistic for each user based on multiuser detection methods quantizes it and transmits it to a central processor the quantizer is a mmse log likelihood ratio quantizer based on these received samples the central processor determines the received bit for each user based on mutisensor signal detection theory this system with cell diversity is shown to perform better than system without diversity
