field theory quantum gravity in this dissertation i describe three main research projects in which i have participated as a graduate student they share the common theme of using monte carlo computer simulation to investigate quantum field theories i begin by giving a brief review of monte carlo simulation as a discrete path integral approach to a quantum theory two of the projects involve tests of the monte carlo renormalization group method a systematic way of integrating out short distance features of a physical system in order to gain insight about its critical behavior and hence its continuum limit after a review of the ideas of the renormalization group i discuss our thorough investigation of monte carlo renormalization of [straight phi] 4 field theory on a two-dimensional square lattice the second renormalization project overlaps with the other main thrust of my research studying quantum gravity as the continuum limit of a sum over all possible ways of piecing together discrete simplices or simplicial quantum gravity i describe a unique monte carlo renormalization group study of scalar fields coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity where we were able to extract the anomalous field dimension for a case inaccessible to analytic methods finally i discuss a study of four-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to gauge fields and special concerns one must be aware of when measuring connected correlators in fluctuating geometry
