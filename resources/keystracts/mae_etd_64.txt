behavior collaborative design function information model product information representation product lifecycle management information models that represent the function assembly and behavior of artifacts are critical in the conceptual development of a product and its evaluation much research has been conducted in this area however existing models do not relate function behavior and structure in a comprehensive and consistent way in this work nist's core product model cpm and the open assembly model oam are extended to integrate product information including function and behavior with an emphasis on assembly throughout all phases of product development for function and flow classification the nist functional taxonomy is used to maintain consistency with the literaturethe consistency validation of product information and the verification of modified product information are discussed these processes ensure that the product information has no contradictions and allows tracing through associations without any deficiency or disconnection in other words the information model has to be complete in terms of traceability of function behavior spatial relationships etc in order to support all information exchange activities the product information representation provides a mechanism for capturing product information and storing it in a database this representation schema also provides necessary information for any future decision making activities in the end of life eol environment such as the replacement or reuse of any part or subassembly when there is a need to replace one artifact with another one must consider all of the associations of the existing artifact with other artifacts and the environment not just functional and space requirements and the relevant modifications of the associated objects has to verified so one can manage product lifecycle activities in different perspectives by knowing how the product information is interconnected in various domains and how its characteristics affect each other
