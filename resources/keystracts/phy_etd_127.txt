low-noise amplification quantum information quantum-limited amplifier superconducting device superconductivity quantum-limited amplification in the microwave frequency range is of both practical and fundamental importance the weak signals corresponding to single microwave photons require substantial amplification to resolve when probing quantum excitations of the electromagnetic field the substantial noise produced by standard amplifiers dominates the signal therefore several averages must be accumulated to achieve even a modest signal-to-noise ratio even worse the back-action on the system due to amplifier noise can hasten the decay of the quantum state in recent years low-noise microwave-frequency amplification has been advancing rapidly and one field that would benefit greatly from this is circuit quantum electrodynamics cqed the development of circuit quantum electrodynamics---which implements techniques of quantum optics at microwave frequencies---has led to revolutionary progress in the field of quantum information science cqed employs quantum bits qubits and superconducting microwave resonators in place of the atoms and cavities used in quantum optics permitting preparation and control of low energy photon states in macroscopic superconducting circuits at millikelvin temperatures we have developed a microstrip superconducting quantum interference device squid amplifier msa to provide the first stage of amplification for these systems employing sub-micron josephson tunnel junctions for enhanced gain these msas operate at microwave frequencies and are optimized to perform with near quantum-limited noise characteristicsour msa is utilized as the first stage of amplification to probe the dynamics of a squid oscillator the squid oscillator is a flux-tunable microwave resonator formed by a capacitively shunted dc squid josephson plasma oscillations are induced by pulsed microwave excitations at the resonant frequency of the oscillator once pulsed decaying plasma oscillations are observed in the time domain by measuring with pulse amplitudes approaching the critical current of the squid it is possible to probe the free evolution of a highly nonlinear oscillator
