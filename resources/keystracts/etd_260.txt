cellular signaling decoy oligonucleotide drug delivery polysialic acid regulation of inflammation is a crucial component of the immune system in response to injury and infection in otherwise healthy individuals an initial acute inflammatory response will subside once the injury or infection is eradicated however in certain disease states including autoimmune disease and persistent infection miscommunication between cells of the immune system leads to a chronic inflammatory response contributing to disease pathology and exacerbating symptoms a major regulator of inflammation communication at the cellular level is transcription factor tf nf-b under normal conditions nf-b is bound to an inhibitor in the cytoplasm in a chronic disease state nf-b is overactive and found in the unbound form resulting in increased production of inflammatory signalstranscription factor decoys tfd are small nucleic acid sequences 20 base pairs that mimic the binding site for the tf on the native dna but do not encode for any proteins by binding to the tf in the cytoplasm tfd have potential to limit excessive immune signaling and inflammatory protein production unfortunately clinical success of tfd has been hampered by a lack of an effective delivery method lack of stability and ease of degradation of the tfd require a protective carrier for delivery however many synthetic carrier systems induce toxicity or an enhanced inflammatory response in disease states characterized by excessive inflammation treatment-induced toxicity or immune response is highly undesirablethe bader lab has previously reported a nanoparticle carrier system based on natural polysaccharides designed specifically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis the materials used in this system have properties that can be exploited for the additional application of dna delivery this thesis will detail the adaptation of polysialic acid-n-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles to be used as delivery vehicles for an nf-b tfd treatment in in vitro models of rheumatoid arthritis and cystic fibrosis
