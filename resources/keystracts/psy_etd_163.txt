generalization intervention reading oral fluency repeated readings to best promote generalization specific programming strategies must be  implemented stokes  baer 1977 attempts at generalizing oral  reading fluency in the past have yielded mixed results using a  between-subjects group design the current study compared an  intervention that directly reinforced the act of generalization  generalized training condition with an intervention that incorporated  the generally accepted method of repeatedly reading a passage repeated  reading condition for their effects on generalized oral reading fluency  gains these two interventions were also compared to a third control  condition thirty-seven second and third grade students reading below  grade level participated results indicated that at post-test students'  fluency in both the generalized training condition and the repeated  reading condition significantly improved over both pre-test and fluency  levels achieved by students in the control condition implications for  effectively generalizing oral reading fluency are discussed
