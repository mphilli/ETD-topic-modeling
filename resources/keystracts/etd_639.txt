homological algebra representation theory in this thesis we investigate the ext-algebra of a basic finite dimensional k-algebra ak\mathcalqi where k is an algebraically closed field and \mathcalq is a finite quiver we denote the ext-algebra of a by ea we denote \baraaa^ to be the direct sum of all simple modules over ain the first part we use the work of green solberg and zacharia to construct a family of elements in k\mathcalq which we call \f_i^j\ these elements yield a minimal projective resolution of \bara over a consequently \f_i^j\ form a dual basis of ea in chapter 2 we see that the subalgebra of ea generated in degrees 0 and 1 is of the form k\mathcalq^i^ and prove the relations in i^ can be directly computed using \f_i^j\ in the case a is graded we provide an alternate proof to the result of l\ofwall and priddy namely that a^ is quadratic then we proceed to compute the relations which generate i^  in the case a is monomial we prove that the family \f_i^m\ is exactly the set of m-chains used by green and zachariain the second part we use a construction by anick green and solberg to form a family \x_i^j\ which yields a projective resolution of \bara called the ags resolution if a is a monomial algebra we prove there are easily checked conditions for ea to be generated in degrees 01 and 2 if a is not necessarily monomial we consider the case where the ags resolution is minimal in that situation we look to the associated monomial algebra of a found in \citeg1 and \citeg2 which we denote \am we prove that if the ags resolution is minimal and e\am is finitely generated then ea is finitely generated
