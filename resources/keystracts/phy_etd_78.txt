hairpins loop structure base mismatch this dissertation presents research in structure determination analysis of nmr relaxation data and data processing which are three important areas for the applications of multi-dimensional nmr techniques to dna structure and dynamicsthe solution structure of an 18 residue dna tetra-loop hairpin with a t-t mismatch in the middle of the stem was determined by 35 ps restrained molecular dynamics simulations followed by energy minimization calculations 239 accurate distance constraints were derived by the mardigras program from 2d noe experimental data a total of 483 constraints including loose distances h-bonds and chirality were obtained the b-form stem structure is well determined two mismatched thymines are well stacked in the stem and protected from the solvent the loop structure is less well-defined due to either an incomplete constraint set or the flexible nature of the loop there is no evidence for hydrogen-bonding in the loop or mismatched basesrepeated measurements of the longitudinal relaxation time t\sb1 and the heteronuclear noe were made prior to the work discussed here the measurement were on a dna duplex the measurements were used to generate values of t\sb1 and noe with normal distributions for each carbon corresponding to the measured errors the order parameter s\sp2 and the effective internal correlation time \rm\tau\sbe in the model-free approach have been optimized from the distributions simulated by mcmoldyn between the two parameters s\sp2 has a smaller relative error estimated at 15 on average which means that s\sp2 is a well-defined parameter however \rm\tau\sbe is very poorly defined with the average relative error estimated at 85 it is typically found in the range of 30-300 psa computer program useful for automated two-dimensional baseplane nmr correction and subsequent t\sb1 and t\sb2 ridge suppression is described the algorithm performs combined correction of smooth baseplane distortions and sharp ridges in 2d nmr spectra through five steps 1 identification of resonance peaks and ridges 2 extraction of an initial putative global baseplane 3 window filtering of the corresponding time domain 4 construction of a 2d spectrum free of baseplane distortion and 5 suppression of ridges the optimal parameters for baseplane and ridge correction are automatically decided by the program yielding a greatly improved spectrum together with more accurate spectral information
