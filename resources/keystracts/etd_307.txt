cap and trade co2 global warming rggi this paper estimates the benefits primarily from human health gains from the longest running us co2 control program  further it examines the patterns of electric generation to evaluate changes at regional and state levels to better understand the potential of co2 leakage which is co2 being emitted from generation that has moved from a regulated to a non-regulated state and thus weakening the effects of the regulationthis examination is achieved using a unique dataset of observed generation levels at fossil fuel plants from the year 2000 to 2013 in new jersey new york and pennsylvania  it is estimated that the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi has reduced co2 emissions in new york state and new jersey by approximately 49 million short tons yearly on average and has produced approximately 130 million worth of ancillary benefits from reduced so2 nox pm25 and pm10 emissions yearly while new jersey participated  just in new york which has participated every year since the program inception in 2009 rggi has produced approximately 35 million short tons and over 69 million worth of ancillary benefits yearly on average  further the study finds weak evidence that rggi has altered generation between new york and pennsylvania during the study period  however it finds stronger evidence that there may have been leakage from maryland and delaware to pennsylvania  there are indications that rggi has contributed to significant changes in generation regionally in new jersey and new york
