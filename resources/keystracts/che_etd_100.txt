retinal holographic memory rhodopsin bacteriorhodopsin part i  the conformational and electronic properties of the 12-s-cis and 12-s-trans conformers of 11-cis retinal are analyzed our models confirm that the 12-s-cis isomer is more stable in vacuum and the 12-s-trans conformer is more stable in polar and nonpolar solvent environments due to dispersive and electrostatic interactions electronic analysis indicates that the features in the absorption spectrum are due to a complex set of overlapping transitions assignments are made for all four band systemsground- and excited-state surfaces connecting rhodopsin and bathorhodopsin along the [special characters omitted] dihedral reaction path are partially adiabatically mapped forward and reverse photochemistry is simulated via molecular dynamics the activated complex is reached in 375 fs following excitation best results for quantum yields and product formation times are obtained by including both dynamic and phased partitioned nonadiabatic coupling [special characters omitted] ps [special characters omitted] ps the lower quantum yield of the b [arrow right] r isomerization is due to a sign change in the nonadiabatic coupling term at [special characters omitted]  92 and to the rapid arrival of the trajectory into the activated complex which prevents equilibration of the excited state and lowers the dynamic coupling term the [special characters omitted] excited singlet state spectrum is calculated as a function of time following excitation of rhodopsina model of thermal noise in rods is proposed whereby thermal isomerization occurs when the retinal schiff base is unprotonated this model accounts for the low activation energy of 23-27 kcal mol -1 and is supported by both molecular models and experimental measurementspart ii  a prototype holographic memory is described which demonstrates simultaneous storage and retrieval of ten holographic images in the same volume of a bacteriorhodopsinbrpolyvinylalcoholpva film the suitability of br as a volume holographic memory medium is discussedphotochemistry in dried pva films of the blue membrane form of br is demonstrated as in solution blue[lef-right arrow]pink interconversion occurs but with much lower quantum yield additionally a species absorbing maximally at 450 nm appears as a photoproduct of blue membrane
