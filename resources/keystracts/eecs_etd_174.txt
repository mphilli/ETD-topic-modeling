efficient algorithms data mining this thesis focuses on the computational aspects and the development of scalable and efficient algorithms for some important data-mining techniques the emerging field of data mining requires the processing of very large datasets this makes the development of efficient and scalable algorithms an essential step towards the success of data miningdata mining combines many techniques and methods from other areas such as statistics machine learning and database although some data-mining techniques have been identified in other fields for more than a decade most of the proposed algorithms in the literature were designed under the assumption of small datasets either in terms of the number of examplespoints or in terms of the number of dimensionsattributes of the examples these limitations and other inherent properties of these techniques generally make them inappropriate for data-mining applications thus there is a great need for the development of efficient and scalable algorithms that will allow for the application of these techniques to large datasetsin this thesis we investigate the development of scalable and efficient algorithms for classification clustering  and similarity join  we mainly follow two approaches to achieve this goal 1 developing exact algorithms while reducing the computational and io requirements and 2 developing approximation algorithms while reducing the computational and io requirements and maintaining a good quality the proposed algorithms are shown to be efficient scalable and robust across different datasets
