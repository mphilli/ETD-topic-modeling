bimetallic organicinorganic hybrid the search for new inorganic materials reflects an urgent need to address today's industrial necessity for materials that can store hydrogen in high quantities at ambient temperatures that act as catalysts and that allow more data storage in hard discs so far the synthesis of important inorganic materials has been done according to the traditional methods the same mix and wait strategy will be applied for their synthesis in the following decades until synthesis of inorganic materials by design is achieved but this goal has proven to be elusive to address this problem i focused on [cuiil n 2n v x o y z- o 3 prpo 3  i 4i- ] system and synthesized numerous compounds by introducing different organic structural units and changing reaction conditions to produce a library of this class of compounds for future mechanistic studies initially i surveyed the effect of temperature on the structures of this system in addition to this i introduced different organoimine l and organophosphonate h 2 o 3 prpo 3 h 2  building blocks to observe their influence on the final structures of the system as it is expected bridging organoimine ligands like tetrapyridylporphyrine and 44'-bipyridine produced mainly three dimensional structures on the other hand chelating ligands like terpyridine and 22'-bipyridine produced one or two dimensional structures the same trend was observed upon the introduction of different organophosphonate units to the system mono and sterically hindered phosphonic acids produced mainly one dimensional compounds whereas bridging diphosphonic acids produced structures in higher dimensions the reactions were conducted under hydrothermal conditions the products of the reactions were characterized by single crystal and powder x-ray spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis along with magnetic studies of selected compounds
