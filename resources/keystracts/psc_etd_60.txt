liberation organizational politics leninism communist party of india marxist-leninist india leninist organizations all over the world subscribe to the basic theoretical perspective entailed in organizational leninism or democratic centralism through an extensive review of party journals complemented by field work in patna india the author has made an extensive analysis and sought to theorize the specificity with which the communist party of india marxist-leninist liberation or cpiml liberation has negotiated between the democratic and the centralist elements between the years 1969-1995 the political experience of 'bolshevism' has posed a stark problem for leninist organizations all over the world can they overcome the problematic aspects of leninism that contributed arguably to the collapse of the second world communist regimes the close examination of cpiml liberation's organizational practices indicates that even though liberation has experimented with various democratic strategies it has not transcended the limitations of what has been called an instrumental vision such a vision lays greater emphasis on the centralizing and strategizing dimensions of party organizing at the cost of the democratic and organic dimensions while it is the author's contention that in a very qualified way the democratic centralist framework still has theoretical validity for leninist organizations it is argued that an immanent critique of indian social relations that takes seriously the epistemic foundations of the social formation is seriously lacking in liberation's theoretical engagement and is the source of its theoretical limitations a gramscian stress on the philosophical underpinnings of common sense and the pivotal role of organic intellectuals is used to analyze the specificity of liberation's democratic practices further the work of subaltern studies scholars particularly ranajit guha and partha chatterjee along with the interventions of kancha ilaiah and gail omvedt has been of pivotal significance in clearing the theoretical ground so as to more comprehensively appraise the potential for democratic possibilities within liberation
