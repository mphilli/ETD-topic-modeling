branching fraction pseudoscalar decay constants d mesons proton decay fd form factor lepton violation two analysis have been described in this work in the first analysis we measure the decay constant of the d    meson by measuring [special characters omitted]  d    [arrow right]      38603200910 -4  using 818 pb -1  of data taken on the 3770 resonance with the cleo detector at the cesr collider this is the full sample of taken acquired by cleo-c at this center-of-mass energy taken along with precision measurement of the lifetime and assuming  v cs       v ud    we derive f d       2058  85  25 mev we also set a 90 confidence upper limit on [special characters omitted]  d    [arrow right] e       88  10 -6   in the second analysis we search for simultaneous baryon and lepton number violating decays of the  d  0  meson specifically we use 281 pb -1  of data taken on the 3770 resonance with cleo-c detector to look for decays d  0  [arrow right]  pe     d  0  [arrow right]  pe     d  0  [arrow right]  pe  -  and d  0  [arrow right]  pe  -   we find no significant signals and set the following branching fraction upper limits d  0  [arrow right] pe     d  0  [arrow right] pe      11  10 -5  and d  0  [arrow right] pe  -   d  0  [arrow right] pe  -    10  10 -5   both at 90 confidence level
