journalist newspapers public journalism role conceptions award-winning this study examines the practice of public journalism at five newspapers that won awards or honorable mentions in the inaugural 1996 james k batten awards for excellence in civic journalism the newspapers are the charlotte observer  the wisconsin state journal the kansas city star  the sioux falls sd argus leader and the dallas morning news  through a content analysis of each of the five projects mail surveys completed by 344 journalists at the five newspapers and in-depth interviews with 15 of the journalists most involved in the projects the study explores whether the projects represent a true shift from traditional journalistic practice and whether a new public journalism role conception is emerging in the five newsroomsthe content analysis explores the projects along five dimensions of traditional practice that have been critiqued by public journalists conflict-ridden reporting reliance on prominent sources episodic reporting adversarial reporting and allegiance to strict objectivity routines it concludes that although the projects have success in minimizing adversarial and conflict-ridden reporting they have trouble breaking through the journalistic constraints on content described by theorists such as gans 1979 tuchman 1973 1977 1978 sigal 1973 gitlin 1980 and others despite public journalism's heavy emphasis on tapping a variety of citizen voices for example only the charlotte project gives equal time to non-prominent and prominent sources through the use of what meyer 1995 calls a data-rich objectivity of journalist method the charlotte project and to some extent the kansas city one move beyond surface-level episodic reporting but the other projects largely do not editors not reporters break some traditional objectivity rules raising some ethical concerns but the content falls well within the hegemonic boundary described by gitlin and well short of the kind of multi perspectival journalism envisioned by gansthe survey and in-depth interviews finds that journalists see public journalism values as distinct from traditional news values but a unified public journalism role conception emerges only in charlotte nonetheless reporters are more positive than negative toward the public journalism movement saying it provides them with more time and resources to do their traditional jobs with greater thoroughness
