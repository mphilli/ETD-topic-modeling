education sector public sector labor-management relationship for the last sixty years or so the labor-management relationship l-m-r in the private sector and for a shorter but still considerable length of time in the public sector has been characterized by a fairly stable organizational arrangement which has served to govern the various parties and their connection to each other recent events however have indicated that this perceived stability particularly in the public sector of education may be in jeopardy as the l-m-r has begun to show signs of stress especially as succeeding waves of challenge have been made upon both the issues andor features of employment as well as by collateral discussion even upon the basic relationship itself kerchner and koppich 1993 shedd and bacharach 1991 mcdonnell and pascal 1988 kochan and katz 1988this qualitative research utilizes a multi-site case study design and employs a series of open-ended interviews to replicate a subset of a study conducted by bacharach and colleagues in 1980 with focus on identifying and detailing the manner in which key participants to the educational l-m-r relate to each other data gathered from both studies is analyzed and compared longitudinally first for evidence of change in the bargaining attitudes and the l-m-r itself second employing constructs derived from those above as well as gersick 1991 and erickson and kuruvilla 1998 this research describes the application of an appropriate framework for describing the characteristics of any revealed changein three school districts reviewed one exhibited a changing relationship that was moving in the direction of revolutionary change a second was observed to have retained status quo and undergone only ad hoc or non-transformational change the third is described as at yet undetermined but tending toward gradually-adaptive changedata indicate that use of the constructs of deep structure as described by four mapping questions can serve as a useful way to determine whether a change in the l-m-r may be said to have occurred while the applied framework points to a possible way for characterizing the results
