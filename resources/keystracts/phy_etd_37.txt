moller scattering parity violation weak mixing angle this dissertation reports on a precise measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in electron-electron mller scattering at a four-momentum transfer q  2   003 gevc 2   the observed parity-violating asymmetry is a pv    -128  14 stat  12 syst  10 -9   this is the most precise asymmetry ever measured in a parity-violating electron scattering in the context of the standard model the apb result determines the weak mixing angle which is one of the fundamental parameters of the model the result is sin 2  [special characters omitted]  02403  00014 which is consistent with the standard model expectation at the current level of precision the comparison between this measurement of the weak mixing angle at low q  2  and at the z  0  pole establishes the running of sin 2  [straight theta] w  with 65 significancein addition we report on the first observation of a transverse asymmetry in electron-electron scattering the observed asymmetry is [special characters omitted]  27  10 -6  which is consistent with the theoretical predictions we also provide a new measurement of the transverse asymmetry in ep scattering [special characters omitted]  2  10 -6 the consistency of the result with the theoretical prediction provides new limits on the tev scale physics a limit of 09 tev was set on the mass of the extra z ' boson in the so10 model a limit of 14 tev and 6 tev was set on the compositeness scales [special characters omitted] and [special characters omitted]  respectively finally a limit of 02 tev was set on ratio of the doubly-charged higgs mass to the ee  coupling [special characters omitted]
