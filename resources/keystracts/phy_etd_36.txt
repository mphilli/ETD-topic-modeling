fuzzy physics noncommutative geometry supersymmetry quantum field theories fuzzy spaces arise as discrete approximations to continuum manifolds they are usually obtained through quantizing coadjoint orbits of compact lie groups and they can be described in terms of finite-dimensional matrix algebras which for large matrix sizes approximate the algebra of functions of the limiting continuum manifold their ability to exactly preserve the symmetries of their parent manifolds is especially appealing for physical applications quantum field theories are built over them as finite-dimensional matrix models preserving almost all the symmetries of their respective continuum modelsin this dissertation we first focus our attention to the study of fuzzy supersymmetric spaces in this regard we obtain the fuzzy supersphere [special characters omitted] through quantizing the supersphere and demonstrate that it has exact supersymmetry we derive a finite series formula for the [low ]-product of functions over [special characters omitted] and analyze the differential geometric information encoded in this formula subsequently we show that quantum field theories on [special characters omitted] are realized as finite-dimensional supermatrix models and in particular we obtain the non-linear sigma model over the fuzzy supersphere by constructing the fuzzy supersymmetric extensions of a certain class of projectors we show that this model too is realized as a finite-dimensional supermatrix model with exact supersymmetrynext we show that fuzzy spaces have a generalized hopf algebra structure by focusing on the fuzzy sphere we establish that there is a [low ]-homomorphism from the group algebra su 2 of su 2 to the fuzzy sphere using this and the canonical hopf algebra structure of su 2 we show that both the fuzzy sphere and their direct sum are hopf algebras using these results we discuss processes in which a fuzzy sphere with angular momenta j splits into fuzzy spheres with angular momenta k and l finally we study the formulation of chern-simons cs theory on an infinite strip of the non-commutative plane we develop a finite-dimensional matrix model whose large size limit approximates the cs theory on the infinite strip and show that there are edge observables in this model obeying a finite-dimensional lie algebra that resembles the kac-moody algebra
