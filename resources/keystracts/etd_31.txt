building design process champs-multizone co-simulation energyplus energy simulation indoor air quality simulation the objective of this study was to develop a virtual design studio vds a software platform for integrated coordinated and optimized design of green building systems with low energy consumption high indoor environmental quality ieq and high level of sustainability the vds is intended to assist collaborating architects engineers and project management team members throughout from the early phases to the detailed building design stages it can be used to plan design tasks and workflow and evaluate the potential impacts of various green building strategies on the building performance by using the state of the art simulation tools as well as industrialprofessional standards and guidelines for green building system designbased on the review and analysis of existing professional practices in building system design particularly those used in us germany and uk a generic process for performance-based building design construction and operation was proposed it included assess define design apply and monitoring addam stages the current vds focused on the first three stagesthe vds considers the building design as a multi-dimensional process involving multiple design teams design factors and design stages the intersection among these three dimensions defines a specific design task in terms of who what and when it also considers building design as a multi-objective process that aims to enhance the five aspects of performance for green building systems site sustainability materials and resource efficiency water utilization efficiency energy efficiency and impacts to the atmospheric environment and ieq the current vds development has been limited to the energy efficiency and ieq performance with particular focus on thermal air quality and lighting environmental quality because of their strong interaction with the energy performance of buildingsthe vds software framework contains four major functions1 design coordination it enables users to define tasks using the input-process-output flow approach which specifies the anticipated activities ie the process required input and output information and anticipated interactions with other tasks it also allows task scheduling to define the work flow and sharing of the design data and information via internet2 modeling and simulation it enables users to perform building simulations to predict the energy consumption and ieq conditions at any of the design stages by using energyplus and a combined heat air moisture and pollutant simulation champs model a method for co-simulation was developed to allow the use of both models at the same time step for the combined energy and indoor air quality analysis3 results visualization it enables users to display a 3-d geometric design of the building by reading bim building information model file generated by design software such as sketchup and the predicted results of heat air moisture pollutant and light distributions in the building4 performance evaluation it enables the users to compare the performance of a proposed building design against a reference building that is defined for the same type of buildings under the same climate condition and predict the percent of improvements over the minimum requirements specified in ashrae standard 55-2010 621-2010 and 901-2010 an approach was developed to estimate the potential impact of a design factor on the whole building performance and hence can assist the user to identify areas that have most pay back for investmentthe vds software was developed by using c with the conventional model view and control mvc software architecture the software has been verified by using a simple 3-zone case building the application of the vds concepts and framework for building design and performance analysis has been illustrated by using a medium size five story office building that received the leed platinum certification from usgbc
