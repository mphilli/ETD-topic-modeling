arterial function metabolic syndrome obesity execrcise myocardial function glucose tolerance the purposes of these studies were to determine the effects of short-term high-intensity exercise training on glucose tolerance cardiac and arterial function in obese individuals with and without metabolic syndrome metsyn secondly the effect of acute hyperglycemia on arterial function was investigated and if short-term training would yield changes during this challenge obese men and women bmi30 kgm  2   39-60 yrs with and without metsyn metsyn 13 non-metsyn 18 underwent exercise training consisting of 10 consecutive d of treadmill walking for 1 hd at 70-75 of peak aerobic capacity subjects performed pre and post-training testing for aerobic capacity glucose tolerance 2 h meal test standard echocardiography endothelial function and arterial stiffness body weight did not change with training in either group aerobic capacity pre vs post improved for both groups main effect 245  12 vs 258  11 mlkgmin p005 glucose area under the curve improved in the metsyn group 1017  58 vs 883  75 pmollmin p005 with no change for the non-metsyn group 685  54 vs 695 70 pmollmin isovolumic relaxation time ivrt improved in the metsyn group 97  6 vs 80  5 msec p005 and remained normal in the non-metsyn group 82  6 vs 86  5 msec endothelial function decreased by 20 p005 for both groups during acute hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia increased central arterial stiffness fasted 7278  0270 vs fed 7735  0220 ms p005 exercise training did not change arterial measures in the fasted or glucose challenged state in conclusion 10 d of high-intensity exercise improved aerobic capacity for obese individuals with and without metsyn and diastolic function and glucose tolerance improved in the group with metsyn arterial function did not improve with training for either group but the meal test did have a deleterious effect on arterial function in both groups
