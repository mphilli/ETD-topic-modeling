anions citrate intracellular loop 1 precipitation proteorhodopsin purification proteorhodopsin pr is an intrinsic membrane protein with an   important role in solar-energy storage of the biosphere earlier work in  our lab  has shown that polyhistidine-tagged pr can be purified by  means of selective  precipitation with citrate under specific  conditions as can a number of mutants  based on this his6-tagged  pr purification of a  heterologously-expressed trans-membrane protein  by a simple salt such as citrate  is novel however such a phenomenon  leads to several questions how does  citrate cause pr precipitation  does the polyhistidine-tag assist in such a  precipitation is this  precipitation ph-specific does citrate affect the  function of pr does  citrate-induced pr precipitation have any biological  significance are  there other ions that could cause pr precipitationthis  dissertation focuses on understanding the nature of the  interaction of  pr with citrate and other anions and in particular on trying to  take  advantage of this interaction in order to develop a novel membrane  protein  purification method the end goal that branches out of these  two aims is to  utilize the compact citrate interaction site identified  in pr by incorporating  it into other membrane proteins and using it to  permit their purification by  similar simple proceduresin  chapter 1 i briefly provide some background information on  the wide  variety of structurally-similar proteins as rhodopsins that include pr   i also describe the general importance of developing purification  methods for  7-helix membrane proteins including prchapter  2 focuses on the investigation of the nature of  citrate-binding site  of pr to address the main question of how citrate aids in  pr  purification site-directed mutagenesis technique was applied to  generate  several single double triple or quadruple mutants of pr in a  histidine-tag  free background which were then tested for their  reactivity to citrate several  different anions were tested to examine  if precipitation of pr was specific to  citrate or whether the  precipitation is susceptible to other negatively charged  salts  photocycle of pr progresses through several intermediates each with a   distinct absorption maximum described in subsection 131  m-intermediate is  detected at ph  8 with max   410  nm flash spectroscopy involves excitation of pr at a particular  wavelength that  leads to transient absorption thus signaling the  formation of the  corresponding intermediate flash-induced transient  visible absorption  measurements were used to assay the effect of  exposing pr to citrate on its  physiological functionchapter  3 describes the development of a method of purification  of pr using  simple salts citrate and phosphate chapter 4 begins an exploration  of  a future direction the ultimate objective is to apply the above  techniques  for the general purpose of 7-helix membrane protein  purification especially for  the important class of pharmacological  receptors known as gpcrs an attempt at  heterologous expression in e coli  and purification of a mammalian gpcr is  described therein such a  method would be desirable for obtaining proteins for  structural  functional and pharmacological studies
