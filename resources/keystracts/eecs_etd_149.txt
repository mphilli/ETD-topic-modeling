flexible manufacturing petri net control systems flexible manufacturing systems fmss have been widely accepted by the modern manufacturing industries however in comparison with the capabilities of fms hardware systems the sophistication of software systems is still far away from the goal that we expected in order to realize optimum fms control the fact is that the rate of acceptance of fmss actually far exceeds the rate of implementation of these expensive manufacturing systems therefore the primary goal of this research is to advance software control capabilities of fmss to this end the research has presented a new methodology as the framework for the development of fms software control systems first to reduce the complexity of software development the hierarchical control architecture exclusively used for fms software control systems is designed and presented secondly in order to systematically precisely and concisely represent the dynamic behaviors of fms control the research has introduced the colored petri net cpn as the modeling tool and further developed a number of cpn models in particular the cpn models are developed for three fms control levels system workstation and device thirdly an object-oriented design and development architecture called fms hierarchical foundation classes library fmsfcl has been defined and further developed which can significantly increase the reliability and reusability of fms system control software finally a graphic software verification prototype called dde verifier has also been developed in the research it is believed that all these research efforts will make important contributions on the methodology of design and development of fms software control systems
