contention-based geographic forwarding wireless networks network protocols geographic routing performance evaluation wireless sensor networks in traditional geographic forwarding for wireless multi-hop networks the beaconing scheme that is used to acquire the geographic information of neighbors incurs unnecessary overhead when there is no data traffic or when the neighborhood information is still fresh it also results in performance deterioration when the network is highly dynamic to address these problems we describe a novel geographic forwarding paradigm called contention-based geographic forwarding cgf to eliminate the use of the beaconing scheme in contrast to traditional geographic forwarding cgf accesses the neighborhood information instantly and selects a next-hop node in a distributed fashion this dissertation studies the cgf paradigm as well as the design and evaluation of cgf protocols for wireless sensor networks we first conduct a topology-level study that models the paradigm and develops an analytical framework to evaluate the cgf performance this framework provides guidelines regarding the selection of the forwarding area for a cgf protocol it also serves as a general performance evaluation framework for most geographic routing protocols next in the packet-level study we propose three network protocols based on cgf the state-free implicit forwarding sif protocol is designed for highly dynamic and resource-constrained sensor networks with a moderate node density it can also be applied to highly mobile ad hoc networks address-free data forwarding adf is designed for address-free sensor networks on-demand geographic forwarding ogf is devised for large-scale and extremely resource-constrained sensor networks with unreliable sensors our analytical and simulation results demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency these two studies at different levels of abstraction show that cgf is capable of becoming a viable communication paradigm for emerging large-scale highly dynamic or resource-constrained wireless multi-hop networks
