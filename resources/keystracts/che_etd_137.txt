wittig rearrangement organic chemistry considerable effort has focused on the development of synthetic methodology to effectively construct the unique structural subunits found within biologically active polyketide-derived natural products one successful approach begins with carbohydrates as chiral building blocks from which the complex structure and stereochemistry of polyketide-related intermediates can be elaborated this dissertation describes the development of a synthetic strategy which utilizes carbohydrates in combination with the 23 -wittig rearrangement for the synthesis of polyketide-derived natural productsthe synthesis of the novel \beta-amino acid 2s 3s 8s 9s-adda a component of hepatotoxic cyclic peptides such as the microcystins nodularin and motuporin isolated from fresh water cyanobacteria is described the present approach uses the 23 -wittig rearrangement of a carbohydrate-derived tertiary allylic ether to establish the stereochemistry at the c\rm\sb6\ c\sb8 and c\sb9 stereocenters of addaa stereoselective and efficient synthesis of an advanced c\sb24-c\sb42 fragment of rapamycin from a carbohydrate template is presented this fragment was rapidly assembled by serial sigmatropic rearrangements of carbohydrate-derived allylic ethers the 23 -wittig rearrangement was used to install the c\sb29 trisubstituted olefin and the c\sb31 and c\sb32 chiral centers of the target compound subsequently the 33 -claisen rearrangement was employed to introduce the cyclohexyl unit and the c\sb35 methyl group of rapamycin
