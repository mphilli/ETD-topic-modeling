carboplatin platinum anticancer drugs carbonate cytotoxicity mechanism of action mesoporous silica 1 the second generation pt 2  anticancer drug carboplatin  cis  -[ptnh 3   2  cbdca- oo'  ] where cbdca is cyclobutane-11-dicarboxylate is here shown to react with carbonate which is present in blood interstitial fluid cytosol and culture medium to produce platinum-carbonato and -hydroxo complexes using 1d  13  c and 1  h nmr spectroscopy 2d [ 1  h  15  n] hsqc nmr spectroscopy and 15  n-labeled carboplatin an uv-visible spectroscopy observed rate constants for the reaction of carboplatin in various media show that co 3  2-  is an important nucleophile for the ring opening of carboplatin and that this reaction is important in the nucleophile-rich rpmi culture medium in the presence of jurkat cells carboplatin is modified not only by substances present in culture medium such as carbonate but also by substances released by the c themselves using 13  c nmr resonances have been detected that by comparison to previously reported carbonato complexes are due to carbonato species produced when carboplatin is allowed to react in carbonate buffer this corroborates [ 1  h 15  n] hsqc nmr which shows the formation of carbonato and hydroxo complex cis  -[ptnh 3    2  co 3  oh] -   the products formed in this reaction are taken up by cells a interact with critical cellular components aging carboplatin in carbonate buffer produces species that are more toxic toward human neuroblastoma renal proximal tubule and namalwa-luc burkitt's lymphoma cells than is intact carboplatin when exposed to carboplatin or carboplatin aged in carbonate normal jurkat cells take upbind approximately the same amount of pt while cisplatin-resistant jurkat cells take upbind less pt when exposed to the latter collectively the studies presented here show that carbonate may play an important role in the mechanism of action of carboplatin in vivo2 mesoporous silica mcm-41 is here shown to adsorb carboplatin using uv-visible spectroscopy and [ 1 h 15 n] hsqc nmr spectroscopy and 15 n-labeled carboplatin the toxicity of mcm-41 two of its functionalized analogs and spherical silica nanoparticles toward human neuroblastoma cells was also investigated cytotoxicity reported in terms of the number of particles required to inhibit normal cell growth by 50 appears related to the adsorptive surface area of the particle however factors such as size and shape also appear to be important collectively these studies explore the suitability of mesoporous silica nanomaterials as vehicles for drug delivery
