experimental high energy the first amplitude analysis bjk j- kk- events is performed in isobar approximation using all six degrees of freedom of their decay kinematics and 3 fb-1 of pp collision data collected at s7-8 tev with the lhcb detector a number of kk states are observed including k1680 which is observed in this decay mode for the first time 8 significant a number of j mass structures are also observed which cannot be described with k contributions alone a broad and significant 76 enhancement just above the kinematic threshold is best described as a dsd-s cusp but a resonant interpretation is also possible with the mass consistent with the x4140 state but with a much larger width than previously claimed the jpc is determined to be 1 at 57 previously inconclusive evidence for the second peak is confirmed with a mass consistent with the 0- dsd-s0 cusp however much better described in our model as a x4274 1 resonance 60 significant the high j mass region shows evidence for more structures of high significance possibly two 0 resonances more data and going beyond the isobar model may be required to clarify the nature of all j mass structures observed in this decay mode
