3-amino-4-chloropyridine imidazopyridine reductive amination the following describes a protocol for the one-pot deprotection and reductive amination of n-boc-3-amino-4-halopyridines the intermediate 3-amino-4-chloropyridinium trifluoroacetate salt combined with trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate tmsotf effectively facilitates condensation with a carbonyl moiety the corresponding imine is subsequently reduced using sodium triacetoxyborohydride the product n-alkyl-3-amino-4-halopyridines provides an effective synthon for our previously reported synthesis of imidazo[45-c]pyridines the current approach greatly improves upon previously alkylation methods of these aryl amines providing an expanded substrate scope with excellent yields
