 the work presented in this thesis outlines our efforts to synthesize alkaline earth metalcoordination complexes that could potentially serve as gas storage and synthetic precursormaterials the properties of these complexes are heavily influenced by factors such as thepropensity to aggregate and the absence of energetically available d-orbitals which providedirectionality these often pose a challenge in obtaining suitable stable compoundssome challenges in the crystallization of alkaline earth coordination complexes involvethe precipitation of insoluble aggregates thus a great part of the work focused on studyingsuitable reaction conditions towards the formation of x-ray quality crystals for structuralelucidation slow concentration and hydrosolvothermal techniques among others were primecrystallization methods in this workthe bulk of this thesis is divided in two parts the first part details our attempts tosynthesize metal organic frameworks mofs of mg ca sr and ba our ligands of choice werethe p m o-pyridinecarboxylic acids which provide two different binding sites these consist ofan n-donor and an anionic carboxylic acid the n-donor located at different positions in thepyridyl ring depending on the isomer these are also of low cost and soluble in different organicsolventsthe use of pyridinecarboxylic acids resulted in the systematic isolation of fivemagnesium coordination complexes three of which exhibit open-framework character andremain stable after removal of guests and two of which are hydrogen bonded networks furthersystematic work with the heavier metals resulted in three fully 3-dimensional complexes basedon ca sr and ba and one hydrogen-bonded ca complex a pattern is observed when using thelinear p or angular m-pyridinecarboxylic acid in the presence of meohdmf mixtures in which3-dimensional motifs with open-framework p and dense m character mg ca and sr aredisplayed the dimensionality decreases in the presence of water or strongly coordinatingdonors leading to the formation of hydrogen bound or 2-dimensional complexesthe second part of this thesis involves the isolation of crown stabilized alkaline earthtosylates the work resulted in the isolation of four new crown stabilized alkaline earth tosylatestrends observed include an increase in coordination number as the size of the metal increasesvariation of crownmetal stoichiometry was also studied and resulted in two different calciumspecies displaying fully separated 11 and contact separated 12 ion association modes for srand ba 11 stoichiometries resulted in hydrogen bound contact speciesthis thesis provides a selection of alkaline earth metal coordination complexes thepreparation of these complexes has led to the elucidation of their synthetic routes fullcharacterization of the complexes is also provided
