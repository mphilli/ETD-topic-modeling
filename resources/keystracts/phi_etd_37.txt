psychogenesis category theory natural numbers the laws of arithmetic and basic theorems of elementary number theory were established long before peano axioms were formulated counting was usually supposed to be the source of this knowledge this idea has been suppressed in philosophical circles since the advent of set theory and mathematical logic especially after frege's attacks against psychologism however as willard van orman quine says those set theoretic definitions of number are notoriously irrelevant to psychogenesis  roots of reference   116 in our psychogenetic account of numbers we revive the old idea that our knowledge of arithmetic and number theory is based upon counting since counting is a process and category theory is the mathematical theory of morphisms which naturally represent processes we use category theory as a tool in modelling the counting process we argue that by attending to some basic features of the counting process we can discover the facts about natural numbers in fact making use of a theorem of lawvere's we derive the peano axioms from the basic features of counting in doing this we try to have our account satisfy the two benacerrafian constraints that the semantics should agree with the standard semantics of scientific discourse and that an account of our mathematical knowledge should reveal the epistemic connection with the source of our beliefs about numbers we argue that the surface semantics of number statements is justified by recourse to the counting techniques and the deep semantics of counting processes as an important aside we obtain an explanation of how we come up with the standard notion of natural numbers the counting process goes all the way with the standard natural numbers and not a step beyond them thus it provides us with the standard notion of natural numbers without provoking any nonstandard notion of natural numbers finally we discuss why our account escapes frege's criticism from psychologism and we defend the possibility of communication about numbers against the wittgensteinian admonitions about rule following
