housing taxation self-employment this dissertation consists of three essays in public and labor economics in the first two i examine individual data on transitions into self-employment essay i examines whether or not the us tax system discourages individuals from starting new businesses and essay ii considers the effect of a self-employed husband on the transition decisions of married women finally essay iii presents a dynamic simulation model of the impact of tax reform--specifically of a flat tax--on owner-occupied housing valuesin the first i estimate random effects probits of whether or not a male wage worker makes a transition into self-employment controlling for a variety of individual household occupational and regional characteristics unique to this study is the use of individual-specific differences in wage-and-salary and self-employment tax rates empirical results show that differential taxation has significant effects on the probability of becoming self-employed lower average tax rates in self-employment increase the probability of entry while lower marginal tax rates in self-employment decrease the probabilitythe focus in the second essay is on the effect of a husband's self-employment experience results show that having a husband with experience in self-employment nearly doubles the probability that a woman will start her own business the effect is found to be strongest if the husband is actually self-employed at the time the wife is contemplating a transition a series of robustness checks suggest that family businesses and assortative mating only partially explain this large effect intrahousehold human capital transfers might also play a rolethe third essay is co-authored by douglas holtz-eakin in it we estimate the effects of a flat tax on owner-occupied housing being careful to disentangle the transitional adjustments from long-run steady-state outcomes simulation results using plausible parameter values indicate that such a reform would not have devastating effects on housing values this divergence is attributed to the business-side tax on new housing which would make existing housing relatively tax advantaged in the immediate term
