network denial-of-service flow control internet protocols denial-of-service dos is one of the major network security threats while network-dos n-dos incidents appear in different forms a large portion of the cases target the vulnerabilities inside internet protocols and the internet infrastructure except for those exploiting flaws in specific applications the lack of security and reliability in the tcpip suite and the internet infrastructure are the two major factors contributing to the lack of network resource availability--network-dos this dissertation analyzes the features and vulnerabilities in the tcpip suite examines insufficiencies of flow control in the internet infrastructure and explores defense strategies against n-dos in internet-protocol-based networks first network dos is classified into several categories based on protocol types n-dos symptom and senders' intent then for non-flooding type n-dos attacks signature-based detection and defense strategies are presented protocol vulnerabilities are analyzed next for flooding n-dos attacks besides vulnerabilities in internet protocols inadequacies in the existing internet infrastructure are also exposed furthermore a flow-control-based model affc anti-flooding flow-control is developed the main components of which include traffic classification dynamic buffer management packet scheduling and early-traffic-regulation etr the primary traffic regulation policy in the affc model is to penalize unresponsive elastic traffic and aggressive best-effort traffic in times of potential n-dos congestion collapse the purpose of the etr is to regulate harmful flows prior to bottleneck nodes in early stages finally distributed dos ddos is addressed combining techniques used against classical n-dos attacks
