cytotoxicity galvanic corrosion magnesium and magnesium alloys oxidation and reduction reactions reactive oxygen species this dissertation characterized how galvanic coupling of magnesium mg with titanium ti via sputtering enhanced the cytotoxicity of mg particles due to increased corrosion rate  mg and mg-ti particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem which showed that mg and mg-ti particles have the average diameter of 50 m which makes them slightly larger than an average mammalian cell  therefore the cytotoxicity of the particles is not due to the ingestion of the particles by cells via phagocytosis but solely due to electrochemical effects  sputtering of ti to partially cover mg particles results in a very thin layer in the range of nm  the surface area of ti covering the mg particles matters more than the thickness of the ti layer as the ti layer serves as a catalyst for the reduction reactions spatially separating the oxidation reaction of mg and the reduction reaction of wateroxygenthe first part of the dissertation focuses on the in vitro cell viability experiments to show that mg and mg-ti particles kill cells in a dosage-dependent manner where mg-ti particles kill cells more effectively than mg alone  cytotoxicity of mg and mg-ti was measured on different types of cells such as murine pre-osteoblast cells human osteosarcoma cells and bacterial escherichia coli cells  for murine pre-osteoblast cells mg killed cells completely at 1500 gml less than 1 while mg-ti killed cells completely at 750 gml which is half of the concentration of mg  doubling and tripling the pre-osteoblast cell density did not increase the particle concentration that required to kill cells completely but did decrease the rate of cell viability drop over particle concentration  mg and mg-ti killed pre-osteoblast cells within 18-24 hours and if many cells were viable cells proliferated and recovered after 24 hours while if more than 50 cells died remaining cells stayed alive but did not proliferate  cytotoxicity of mg and mg-ti also depended on proximity where only cells less than 2 mm away from the cluster of particles were killed  for osteosarcoma cells mg could not kill cells completely even at 2500 gml while mg-ti killed cells completely at 1250 gml by 24 hours  by 72 hours mg killed cells completely at 2500 gml and mg-ti killed cells completely at 1000 gml  higher concentrations and longer periods of time were needed to kill osteosarcoma cells compared to murine pre-osteoblast cells  osteosarcoma cells also showed the same trend as pre-osteoblast cells where at low particle concentrations the cells were able to proliferate and recover at medium particle concentrations the remaining live cells did not proliferate and at high particle concentrations the cells died and did not recover  the remaining live cells and their daughter cells did not gain resistance to the particle treatment as they were killed again without having to increase the particle concentration  24-hour grown e coli biofilms and planktonic cells were also treated with high concentrations of particles and compared to conventional antibiotics such as ofloxacin mg and mg-ti were able to kill biofilm more significantly although not completely down to 2  however mg and mg-ti showed great promise in killing and preventing biofilmsthe second part of the dissertation focuses on investigating whether ph is the main cause of mg cytotoxicity as many studies have claimed and if the ph is the major or sole cause of enhanced cytotoxicity of mg-ti  this study showed that the ph levels of mg and mg-ti were the same at the same particle concentration which does not explain the increased killing of mg-ti  also mg and mg-ti did not just kill cells directly but also affected the components such as the proteins in the cell culture mediumoverall this study provides better understanding of cytotoxicity of mg and mg-ti so that not only mg and mg-ti can be used to target and kill cancer and bacterial infections for the therapeutic effect but to show that mg and mg-based alloys may not be as biocompatible which is still the common conception of this biomaterial
