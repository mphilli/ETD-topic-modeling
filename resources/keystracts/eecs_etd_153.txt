reliable multicast fec-based scalable multicast protocol extending ip multicast functionality to facilitate scalable reliable data delivery has been identified as an important challenge for the next generation internet many of the proposed reliable multicast protocols cannot scale well to a large number of receivers because they suffer from state explosion or message implosion or both to address those problems we present an forward error correction fec based scalable reliable multicast transport protocol that greatly improves the scalability of reliable multicast protocols and also simplifies protocol structurethe distinction of our approach to scalable reliable multicast largely owes to the scheme of using error-correcting erasure codes to achieve reliable internet communications a reed-solomon codes based erasure coding fec scheme is proposed and its software implementation demonstrates that it is practically feasibleto make a case for incorporating fec into scalable reliable multicast we show through quantitative analyses and numerical results that compared with arq the use of fec in reliable multicast will greatly reduce packet loss probability which in turn will result in a dramatic improvement in protocol scalabilityfinally an fec based scalable reliable multicast protocol fmcast is proposed and its design and implementation are presented fmcast provides reliable delivery of point-to-multipoint transmissions to achieve scalable error-control fmcast employs erasure codes based fec scheme and data carouseling fmcast meets the design objective of scalable reliability it also supports receiver heterogeneity and receiver late-joinearly-leave a user-level implementation of fmcast on ip multicast has been tested and evaluated on multicast backbone mbone
