disorder jammed vibration in this thesis i will investigate the properties of disordered materials under strain  disordered materials encompass a large variety of materials including glasses polymers granular matter dense colloids and gels  there is currently no constitutive equation based on microscopic observables that describes these materials given the prevalence and usefulness of these materials we derive tools to aid our understanding of themwe develop a new method to isolate localized defects from extended vibrational modes in disordered solids  this method augments particle interactions with an artificial potential that acts as a high-pass filter it preserves small-scale structures while pushing extended vibrational modes to higher frequencies  the low-frequency modes that remain are ``bare defects they are exponentially localized without the quadrupolar tails associated with elastic interactions we demonstrate that these localized excitations are excellent predictors of plastic rearrangements in the solid we characterize several of the properties of these defects that appear in mesoscopic theories of plasticity including their distribution of energy barriers number density and size which is a first step in testing and revising continuum models for plasticity in disordered solidswe additionally study the properties of rearrangement types in 2d disordered packings of particles with a harmonic potential at a range of packing fractions above jamming  we develop a generalizable procedure that classifies events by stress drop energy drop and reversibility under two protocols  somewhat surprisingly we find a large population of contact change events that have no associated stress drop reversible events become more common at high pressures above a packing fraction of \phi0865 at which point line reversible events are more common than loop reversible events at low pressures irreversible events are associated with spatially extended events while at high pressures reversible events are much more spatially localized
