electrical engineering gaussian noise atmospheric noise vlflf communication systems modems the motivation for this effort begun in 1970 was the inadequacy of the available descriptions of the available descriptions of coherent receiver performance in very low frequency vlf and low frequency lf atmospheric noise extensive on-air testing of coherent vlflf communication systems clearly showed that their real-world performance was far different from that calculated for and measured in white gaussian noise moreover modulator-demodulator modem systems designed to be optimum in gaussian noise are not necessarily optimum in atmospheric noise hence a quantitatively accurate characterization of coherent detection in vlflf atmospheric noise would provide the dual capabilities of accurately assessing system performance and a basis for developing optimum real-world modem and receiver systems
