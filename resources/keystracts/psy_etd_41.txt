age differences memory grocery items imageryfamiliarity-matched thirty younger mean age  19 and 30 older mean age  72 adults participated in two experiments in which recall and recognition were assessed for lists of grocery items or familiarity-matched non-grocery items clusterability of items based upon category membership was manipulated to assess clustering strategy usage furthermore study participants completed a questionnaire pertaining to grocery shopping experiences strategies and attitudes and completed a diary for seven to ten days documenting grocery shopping activity between sessions 1 and 2 evidence exists through age comparisons of item recognition accuracy data that cognitive maps memory of a store's layout can serve to compensate for older adults' deficits in recognition memory item clustering ultimately did not buffer memory performance in older adults in addition older adults were more susceptible to interference effects and source memory deficits in both free recall and cued recognition results suggest that older adults have less precise memory traces than younger adults perhaps due to interference effects source memory deficits or both
