protein phosphatase 2a schizosaccharomyces pombe par1 par2 cytokinesis protein phosphatase 2a pp2a is a major serinethreonine phosphatase found in all eukaryotic cells the pp2a holoenzyme is comprised of a catalytic c subunit a structural a subunit and a regulatory b subunitin my thesis work i identified and characterized two b ' subunit genes of pp2a in schizosaccharomyces pombe  namely par1 and par2  both genes share high homology with other known b ' genes neither is essential but together they are required for growth at both high and low temperatures growth under a number of physiologically stressful conditions and septum positioning and cytokinesis cross-organism experiments showed that both par1 and par2 could complement a deletion of saccharomyces cerevisiae rts1  a gene encoding a b ' homolog furthermore both par1p and par2p physically associate with the catalytic subunits of pp2a confirming that both genes encode s pombe pp2a b ' subunitsin some par mutant cells the septum is not centrally located fluorescence microscopy revealed that the mitotic actin ring and mid1p are also eccentrically located in par1par2 cells indicating that par genes are involved in regulating mid1p and actin ring localization to ensure correct septum positioning we also found that in par mutants interphase mid1p nuclear staining is much weaker than that seen in wild type cells and western blots showed that this might be caused by a reduced mid1p abundancepar1par2 cells also show a multi-septation phenotype very similar to that seen in hyperactive sin septation initiation network mutants i examined the genetic interactions between par deletions and sin mutants and found that par1par2 suppressed byr4-op defects and rescued a loss-of-function allele of spg1  but could not suppress any mutations in genes downstream of spg1  i showed further that par deletions suppressed the lethality of the spg1 allele through restoration of the correct localization of cdc7p to the spindle pole body spb the fact that par mutants themselves exhibited a symmetric localization of cdc7p to spbs indicated a hyperactivity of sin in such cells i concluded that par genes normally negatively regulate sin at or upstream of cdc7 insuring that multiple rounds of septation do not occur
