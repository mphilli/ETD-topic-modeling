ethics moral magnetism emotion value world in this work i discuss moral magnetism or how to take the to-be-doneness of some evaluative experience seriously as making sense on the account i propose moral magnetism is not part of nature nor does it reduce to individual psychological states or occurrences dispositions or motivational structures instead it involves what is to be expected where expectation is embedded in a situation sometimes this involves mental states and motives but it does not involve them necessarilyethical subjectivism would reduce moral magnetism to narrow content and account for the phenomenon perhaps in terms of a projection error against arguing this way i discuss external constraints on emotions and psychic feelings on the account i propose some evaluatively important emotional content is wide content thus not only is it important to understand moral magnetism for its own sake as an aspect of evaluative experience it is also important for overcoming debates over realism and subjectivism and over internalisms and externalisms in ethics and philosophy of mindthe dissertation places interpersonal relations and social activities and the emotions they involve at the center of both ethics and metaethics it also expands the discussion of what counts as reasons by bringing considerations from metapsychology to bear upon aspects of moral magnetism
