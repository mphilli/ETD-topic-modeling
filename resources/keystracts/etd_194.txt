alpha background betacage dark matter detection miniclean simulation long-life isotopes 238u and 232th exist in almost any material 222rn as a daughter of 238u widely exists in the atmosphere it has a half-life of 38 days which is long enough for it to travel and diffuse through material surfaces  the alphas and betas from radon daughters are a dominant background for essentially all rare-event searches including dark matter searchesdark matter detectors require very low background because wimps have very small cross-sections with nuclei alpha decay on the inner surface of the liquid argon sphere is one of the dominant backgrounds this dissertation has described the simulation and discrimination of this surface alpha decay background in the miniclean experiment by a combination of analysis specifically to reduce these eventsenergy pulse shape discrimination and position reconstruction and by hardware changes the adding of baffles the surface alpha background is reduced sufficientlyreduction of these surface backgrounds may also be achieved using the betacage which is planned to be the most sensitive low-energy electron and alpha screener ever  this dissertation described the simulation of photon and radon backgrounds of betacage the simulation shows that the sensitivity goal is achieved 1000 times better than current detectors this dissertation has described the simple model and method of particle track reconstruction
