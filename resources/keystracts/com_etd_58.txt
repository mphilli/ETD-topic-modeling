informal communication this research is a case study using a city's chamber of commerce to investigate the role of boundary spanning individuals in an organization in particular it focuses on differences among staff members those identified both as boundary spanners and non-boundary spanners based on their level of boundary spanning activity in terms of their power and influence role conflict job routinization and communication satisfaction gender differences in boundary spanning and the differing functions of boundary spanners are also investigated the research was carried out over a 10-month period and used multiple methods of investigation both quantitative and qualitativeboundary spanners were identified through the use of telephone logs and a follow-up questionnaire and were then clustered by level of boundary spanning activity the findings indicated that both organizational leaders and co-workers perceived boundary spanners as having more influence both within and outside the organization than do non-boundary spannersit was also found that male boundary spanners were perceived by co-workers as having more internal and external influence than female boundary spanners an interesting although not statistically significant finding was that in spanners as having greater influence than male boundary spannersthe study further showed that within the case it was not possible to clearly differentiate between the informational and representational roles of boundary spanners instead five overlapping functions termed 1 transacting 2 filtering 3 external information acquisition and control 4 representation and 5 buffering by adams 1980 were identifiedthe gatekeeping role of boundary spanners was also investigated it was found that boundary spanners are more likely to relay through informal communication information that they've learned from outside the organization than they are to relay that information if they must depend on formal communication an individual's perception of the routinization of his or her organizational role was found to have an inverse relationship with perceived power finally no statistically significant differences were found among levels of boundary spanning for either role conflict or communication satisfaction across the organization
