frameworks hydrothermal metal organic this research encompasses the detailed investigation of the design and synthesis of metal organic framework mof materials involving the miii polyazaheterocycleanion system in order to expand our understanding of the principles which render the chemistry more controllable and predictable in addition this research investigates the development of properties in these classes of compounds furthermore it has been demonstrated that hydrothermal reaction conditions of stoichiometry ph and temperature can influence the identity of the productsthe structural versatility of the miiipolyazaheterocycleanion system for m  cuiii coii ni ii zn ii and cdii and where the anion is f- cl- i- oh- so42- or po43- is a reflection of the many structural determinants at play these include factors such as i the variety of coordination polyhedra available to the metal ii variable modes of coordination associated with the azoleate ligands iii the role of functional substituents on the azolate moiety iv the incorporation and coordination preferences of secondary anionic components xn- or xomn- and v the variable incorporation of solvent moleculesthe structural chemistry of these materials is quite complex as evidenced by the range of component substructures observed including a range of chains layers frameworks and embedded metalazolate clusters in addition many of the products exhibited interesting magnetic properties while a number of recurring structural motifs have been observed the remarkable array of structures of materials in this study underlines the difficulty in predicting product composition and the challenge in rational design of framework materials it is anticipated that the continued elaboration of a structural data base for these complex hierarchical materials will evolve into a structural systematic
