hydrogen storage growth and hydrogen adsorption properties of pdal and alpd bilayers and microstructural and hydrogen storage properties of alpdal composite films are studied in this work pd was found to grow epitaxially on fiber textured \langle111\rangle al thin films after an initial alloying phase the full electronic properties of the pd adlayer as signified by the saturation work function change did not develop until 7-8 monolayers of pd were deposited aluminum also grew epitaxially on 111 pd single crystal films the growth was initially layer growth followed by a roughening which indicated the onset of island formation hydrogen did not adsorb on the \langle111\rangle al surface but did adsorb dissociatively on the 111 pd surface the exposures of pdal bilayer surfaces to hydrogen caused a significant work function change indicating adsorption however the saturation contact potential difference was less than that for the more perfect 111 pd surface the adsorption kinetics for the bilayer surface were similar to those for 111pdhydrogen as measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry was incorporated into the alpdal structures the hydrogen was confined to the pd layer the amount of hydrogen increased with exposure pressure and no hydrogen above the background level was detected for cases where the pd thickness was less than 20 a the electromigration resistance of the three-layer films was unaffected by the incorporation of hydrogen however the pd layer affected the microstructure of the top al layer leading to an increase in the median time to failure
