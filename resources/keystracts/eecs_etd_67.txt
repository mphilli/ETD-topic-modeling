service-oriented architecture audiovideo conferencing video conferencing publish-subscribe audiovideo conferencing over internet is increasing rapidly with the increase on the available network bandwidth and computing power even the cell phones will have the capacity to participate in videoconferencing sessions in the near future this requires scalable and universally accessible videoconferencing systems increasingly diverse set of endpoints with various capabilities from cell phones to room based systems should be supported in such videoconferencing sessions however developing videoconferencing systems over internet is a challenging task since audio and video communications require high bandwidth and low latency in addition the processing of audio and video streams is computing intensive therefore it is particularly difficult to develop scalable systems that support high number of users with various capabilities current videoconferencing systems can not fully address the problem of scalability and universal accessibility therefore in this thesis we investigate scalable service oriented architecture for audiovideo conferencingwe propose using a publish subscribe event broker network for the distribution of real-time audiovideo streams in videoconferencing sessions and investigate the issues pertaining to scalability performance data representation and routing we identify the requirements for the delivery of real-time audiovideo traffic and incorporate necessary changes to the event delivery middleware we present the results of extensive performance tests for the delivery of audiovideo streams for both large and small size meetings in single and multiple broker settings in addition we propose a scalable and flexible architecture for meeting management and media processing that can grow dynamically to provide services to higher number of users
