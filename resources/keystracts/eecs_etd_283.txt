virtual machine metacomputing world wide web this thesis discusses the major issues in building a metacomputing environment based on world-wide web www and high performance computing and communication hpcc technologies and describes the design and implementation of such an environment called world wide virtual machine wwvm the presented work helps to carry much of the past decade's work in hpcc technologies to the larger www domainthe wwvm exploits the open interfaces brought by web servers it extends the servers via common gateway interface cgi extensions and uses pvm daemons and low-level protocols such as http tcpip and udpip in order to combine remote networked computers as a single machine the wwvm can work in stand-alone message-passing and dataflow modes and provides the interoperability of many diverse software and hardware components the stand-alone mode allows computations to be performed on a remote wwvm server or any other machine coordinated by a server in the message-passing mode the wwvm is capable of executing message-passing pvm and mpi programs and high performance fortran hpf programs compiled by the syracuse fortran 90dhpf compiler as well as parallel programs using pcrc or global arrays runtime support libraries in the dataflow mode wwvm's coordination layer interprets a simple task flow data-dependency description language to deduct the dataflow patterns between different wwvm nodesthe wwvm supplies an integrated web-based programming environment and gives pervasive access to remote wwvm facilities from any platform unix pc or mac using a standard web browser client-side web technologies such as html javascript plug-ins and java supply a platform-independent graphical user interface and visualization capabilities that include analyzing data output from programs and performance information recorded in pablo's sddf format the associated data wrapper libraries provide real-time application-specific data display and computational steering capabilities by providing a link between running parallel programs and client-side java applets
