volatility forecasting black-scholes model informational content this dissertation consists of three essays the first essay focuses on implied volatility estimation a refined approach to estimating the implied volatility is introduced for options priced in the classic framework developed by black and scholes1973 and merton1973 it extends the formula developed in corrado and miller's paper1996 2004 in which the formula works well for the index options with the present value of strike price close to index price the refined approach provides more accurate implied volatility estimates over a wider range of moneynessthe second essay focuses on the well known volatility smile phenomenon numerous explanations for the volatility smileskew phenomenon and extensions of or alternatives to the black-scholes model have been offered in the literature the inconsistence between the alternative models and data makes it worthwhile to re-think the well-known black-scholes model in this essay i provide a new perspective of the volatility smileskew and non-flat term structure phenomenon through carefully studying the mathematical structure of the black-scholes formula though it has been conjectured that the presence of measurement error can be of substantial impact on volatility estimation i show rigorously the level of sensitivity of price error to the volatility estimation for the options at different strikes and maturities in the presence of price error my results show that the degree of the bias of the implied volatility obtained from the option market price is directly related to the option's moneyness and maturity and such bias can be minimized using option with appropriate strike and maturity from a mathematical point of view i conclude that observed volatility smileskew or non-flat term structure phenomenon does not necessarily violate the log-normal return and constant volatility assumption required by the black-scholes model in the presence of price errorin the third essay the focus is on the volatility forecasting--examining the informational content of the implied volatility and more specifically answering the question which implied volatility provide the best measure of the future volatility the volatility smileskew phenomenon makes it unclear which implied volatility provides the best measure of the market volatility expectation over the remaining life of the options due to its liquidity and less sensitivity to price error at-the-money implied volatility is often considered a good measure of future volatility in this essay i compare the predictive power of the implied volatilities from at-the-money option and option with the highest vegadefined as optimal option and show that the advantage of using optimal option can increase as forecasting horizon increases
