potential theory of polanyi dubinin-astakhov da equation analysis of high pressure adsorption isotherms on activated carbon at a number of temperatures for methane ethane ethylene propane carbon dioxide and nitrogen was carried out isotherms were obtained both above and below the critical temperature tc for ethane ethylene and carbon dioxide below tc for propane and above tc for methane and nitrogen and up to 60 atmospheres of pressurethe adsorption data were analyzed by the potential theory of polanyi the adsorption data were reduced to temperature independent characteristic curves for each adsorbate the adsorbed phase molar volumes necessary to obtain the characteristic curves were evaluated by dubinin's method in this method an exponential increase with temperature of the adsorbed phase molar volumes is postulated it was observed that adsorption potential defined as rtlnfsf where fs was calculated from ps  ttc\sp2pc resulted in temperature invariant characteristic curves for each adsorbatethe equations for adsorption isotherms for each adsorbate were developed using the dubinin-astakhov da equation values of the three parameters \rm w\sb0 \rm e\sb0 and n were found to be temperature independent for each of the adsorbates these parameters for each adsorbate were found to represent the experimental isotherms within 5-8 a single equation was obtained by least square regression of the adsorption data for all the gases from this equation the adsorption data could be well predicted at high pressures at low pressures however the errors between the experimental and predicted values were largeisosteric heats and differential entropies of adsorption were obtained from the experimental data affinity coefficients obtained by considering the ratio of polarizabilities for the adsorbate referenced to that of a standard one reduced the characteristic curves of all the adsorbates onto a generalized characteristic curve the variation in isosteric heats of adsorption with coverage for the adsorbates could not be reduced onto a single generalized curve by these affinity coefficients a new approximation is proposed affinity coefficients adapted from a method suggested by wakasugi reduced both the adsorption data and variation of isosteric heats onto single curves account was taken of the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent in these affinity coefficients from entropy considerations it was found that adsorption was localized abstract shortened with permission of author
