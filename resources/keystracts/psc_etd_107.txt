authoritarianism central asia leadership the countries of post-soviet central asia  share remarkable  similarities they came into existence at the same  time have since undergone  similar processes and challenges in  establishing statehood are culturally  related to each other share  similar historical paths and have nearly--if not  totally-- identical  political institutions despite such similarities however  the  countries have developed distinct political regimes manifested among   others in the consolidation of presidential power--the degree to which  the  presidents hold the monopoly on power and allow for political  contestation and  challenges to their authority from opponents this  study suggests that the  differing ways the power was consolidated in  central asia have led to divergent  types of political regimes and are  closely associated with the leadership styles  adopted by the presidents  in each country during the period immediately  following independence  in uzbekistan the president's advocate style allowed  him to eliminate  political opposition early on and dominate the political  landscape in  kazakhstan the president's pragmatic-advocate style resulted in a  less  repressive political order in kyrgyzstan the president's  opportunistic  style allowed for more oppositional activity resulting in  the most vibrant  political scene in the region
