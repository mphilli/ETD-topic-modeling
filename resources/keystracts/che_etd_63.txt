enantiomeric excess chiral near-infrared vibrational circular dichroism fourier transform vibrational circular dichroism ft-vcd spectrometers equipped with various types of light sources and detectors and modified to dual polarization modulation dpm were set up in our laboratory on the basis of commercial instruments--the chiral ir  from biotools inc vcd spectra of nine terpenes and derivatives were recorded with the dpm-ft-vcd spectrometers in near-infrared nir regions from 10000 to 4000 cm  -1  and mid-infrared mir region from 4000 to 800 cm  -1   the nir-vcd spectra were the first measured by ft-vcd instruments with unsurpassed quality in spectral precision signal-to-noise ratio spectral resolution and simplicity of instrumentationthe first use of ft-vcd in conjunction with partial least squares pls chemometric analysis to follow changes in the percent enantiomeric excess ee of chiral sample molecules with time using a flow-cell sampling apparatus is reported the flow-cell sampling simulates the progress of the chemical reaction from a chiral reactant to a chiral product where the ee of both molecules can change with time for the molecules studied -pinene camphor and borneol ee changes were successfully followed by mir- and nir-vcd spectroscopy and predicted by pls models with decent accuracy these findings demonstrate the potential for vcd to be used for real-time monitoring of the composition and ee of chemical reactions involving the synthesis of chiral moleculesnir-vcd spectroscopy and the pls method have been applied to follow real reactions involving chiral molecules the epimerization reactions of s--22-dimethyl-13-dioxolane-4-methanol s-ddm in different solvents were successfully monitored by following the nir-vcd spectral changes of the o-h combination bands of s-ddm in the spectral range of 5050 to 4700 cm -1  an interesting solvent effect of the ddm epimerization reaction was discovered a preliminary nir-vcd investigation of an sn2 substitution reaction preparation of 2-chlorobutane is also reportedto obtain high signal-to-noise ratio and better quantitative analysis accuracy the optimal instrument settings and data collection parameters for vcd measurements such as measurement time resolution aperture size optical filters and preamplifier feedback resistor were exploredthe best spectral resolutions for vcd measurements have been recommended
