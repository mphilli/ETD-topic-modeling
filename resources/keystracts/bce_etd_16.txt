molecular toughening epoxy resins siloxane the fracture resistance of epoxy resins is significantly improved through a new molecular toughening mechanism without sacrificing the desired thermal and mechanical properties a liquid diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-a type epoxy resin dgeba was modified using a methylphenyl siloxane mps oligomer under the catalysis of tetraisopropyl titanate tpt a variety of characterization techniques confirmed that the methoxyl end group of the mps modifier was reacted with the hydroxyl group of the dgeba resin forming a grafted molecular structurethe curing kinetics between dgeba and an aromatic amine metaphenylenediamine mpda was extensively investigated using isothermal and dynamic differential scanning calorimetry dsc techniques the mps modified dgebampda systems follow the same autocatalytic curing mechanism as the unmodified one based on a time-temperature-transformation ttt diagram the optimum curing conditions were determined as 130c for 2 hours curing and 170c for 3 hours postcuring the dibenedetto and wisanrakkitgillham models provide a satisfactory prediction of the t g - relationship over the whole conversion rangeboth the critical stress intensity factor k ic  and the critical strain energy release rate g ic  of the modified dgebampda samples increase with an increasing mps content at 15 wt mps content k ic shows a 25-fold increase and g ic shows a 88-fold increase compared with the unmodified dgebampda system for the mps modified dgebampda systems the high glass transition temperature and the thermal stability were well maintained the tensile and the flexural strengths and strains were improved while the young's modulus and the flexural modulus were slightly decreased the moisture resistance was improvedthe morphologies of the unmodified and the mps modified dgebampda systems were studied using both optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques with the incorporation of the mps oligomer a two-phase microstructure was observed on the fracture surface the second phase particle may be caused by the mps oligomer coalescing during curing the toughening mechanisms identified include localized shear deformation of the epoxy matrix particle tearing fracture and cativation and crack deflectionthe factors including modification method mps modifier type and curing agent type affect the structure-property relationship of modified epoxy resin the chemical modification method is more efficient in enhancing the fracture toughness of dgebampda system than the physical blending method the differences in the fracture toughness of various types of siloxane-modifier dgeba systems can be attributed to their different morphological structures the mps modifier is more efficient in improving the fracture toughness of aromatic amine mpda cured dgeba system than that of aliphatic amine polyoxypropylene diamine popda cured dgeba system
