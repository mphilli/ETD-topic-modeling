 the inability to adequately vascularize tissues in vivo or in vitro currently limits the development of tissue engineering especially to fabricate formation of functional vascular bed within the tissue construct is becoming the key challenge in tissue engineering answering the question on how to build up micro-channels in 3d environment to mimic the vascular structure and function inevitably becomes the essence of this challenge as a first step towards address this problem we aim to develop a functional blood vessel by using a microfluidic device with relevant cell types using an easy-to-use 3d printing approachin this work we developed a strategy to mimic the vascular structure by using multicellular vascular channels are formed using a 3d printed template which is then coated by using gelatin methacrylate hydrogel construct encapsulated with murine 10t12 and lined with human endothelial cells huvecs within the channels this approach has multiple advantages 3d printing techniques offer an approach to fabricate complex geometries capable of controlling the geometry-induced flow changes precisely gelatin methacrylate gelma was coated inside of the pdms channel to form an inner layer then gelma layer laden with murine 10t12s cells is lined with a monolayer of human endothelial cells huvecs to form the vascular inner environment lastly highlow molecular weight dextran molecules conjugated with fluoresces were flowed through the channel to test the integration and diffusion features of the l-shape hydrogel microfluidic corresponding shear flow effects were demonstrated using comsol simulations overall our work demonstrates a robust inexpensive and biocompatible method of developing a vascular model in user-defined geometry with a potential for drug delivery research tumor cells invasion research and disease modeling applicationsresults prove that first 3d printing technique can be used to fabricate microfluidic devices 3d printing is a low-cost easy-to-use fabrication method as compared to the expensive expertise-driven clean-room based lithography process used conventionally to fabricate microfluidic chipsdevices secondly gelatin methacrylate is an optimal biomaterial to facilitate nutrient diffusion and is sufficient to support cell viability of encapsulated 10t12 cells and huvecs binding last the l-shaped hydrogel microfluidic model performs a functional barrier both largesmall molecular weight dextran moleculesthis functional micro-vessel platform serves as a unique experimental tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms of vascular remodeling in the future use the fabrication strategy used in this work can be used for the tumor cell invasive research and vascular drug delivery tests
