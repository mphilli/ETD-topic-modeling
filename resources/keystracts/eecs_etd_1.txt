face recognition learning curve fusion wireless confidence interval face recognition as a non-intrusive and non-contact biometrics has been gradually accepted by the general public to be used in authentication forensics and security the active research and commercial efforts keep raising the bar of recognition accuracy while dragging down the equipment costs however the scalability of such a system is still a challenging problem  motivated by the learning curve phenomenon we propose intelligent sampling to construct a representative and efficient training database initial clustering is implemented to measure the difficulties of the training images to the current system and the recognition performance is evaluated to determine whether and what training images should be included intelligent sampling alleviates the overfitting problem this training set construction minimizes training yet takes advantage of the full potential of face recognition algorithms without a complete system overhaul  after the features are extracted a modified indifference zone method mizm is proposed for feature selection it is shown that the objective function of mizm is consistent with the linear discriminant analysis lda method mizm extends the ranking and selection procedure from principle component analysis pca to lda supporting better face recognition performance than using the scree plot or using all images  features are further screened by an unsorted discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm a product rule is proposed to update the likeliness which double-asserts the selections of several attractors of the particle a validation set is utilized for selection and a disjoint test set proves the generalizability of this method on unseen images  besides feature extraction and selection diversity in feature extraction helps to improve face recognition performance through similarity score evaluation and multiple classifier decision making the recognition performance from the fusion of a strong classifier and several weak classifiers at score and decision levels improves from either classifier alone it is illustrated that uni-modal face recognition fusion is effective  at last motivated by the demand of mobile identification units and the prevalent availability of wireless networks we propose a distributed wireless face recognition system image compressions distributed calculations and the effect of transmission errors on the final recognition performance are studied
