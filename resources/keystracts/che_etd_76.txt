rhenium radiopharmaceuticals diagnostics therapeutics nuclear medicine a number of rhenium compounds were synthesized and characterized in an attempt to investigate and expand the coordination chemistry of the widely used medicinal imaging radioisotope technetium-99m technetium and rhenium are group vii cogeners with similar hydrazine and oxo-thiolate chemistries these periodic similarities have allowed for the study of the non-radioactive metal rhenium instead of the synthetically created technetium which only exists as radioactive isotopesin chapters 1-4 and 6 we address the 31 concept of ligand addition to a group vii metal-oxo species using tridentate ligands carrying the sss sos ons snrs donor atom set r  various alkyl or aryl substituted pendant groups and a monodentate thiol however chapter 5 reveals that in the absence of thiolate donors the reo 3 core may expand its coordination sphere to accommodate five additional donor groups an observation suggesting that 32 complexes will provide an alternate strategy for the systematic synthesis of materials exploiting the modification of the tridentate and bidentate ligandschapter 7 explores hydrazines as potential tethers forming two classes of compounds namely [mcl 3  1 -nnc 5 h 4 nh 2 -hnnc 5 h 4 n] and [mcl 3  1 -nnc 4 h 3 n 2 h 2 -hnnc 4 h 3 n 2 ] m  re or mo the study continued with the exploration of the chlorine substitution with potentially useful thiol and alcohol coligandsfinally chapter 8 uses the 31 approach in designing long-chain fatty acids for imaging blood perfusion to the heart muscle myocardium
