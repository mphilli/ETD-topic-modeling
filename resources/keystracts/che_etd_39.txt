antennas lanthanide oxazoline nitrobenzoates trivalent lanthanide ions are being increasingly used for the development of various kinds of luminescent materials with euiii and tbiii being the most popular euiii compounds show intense red luminescence with characteristic emission in the 615-625 nm region while the tbiii compounds show intense green luminescence with characteristic emission in the 540-550 nm region because of the large size of lanthanide ions and of the numerous possible non-radiative de-excitation pathways available in their complexes the design of efficient ligands for sensitization of lniii emission is very challengingone of the main objectives of our research is the development of euiii and tbiii-based luminescent complexes that are covalently linked to a polymer backbone for use in polymer light-emitting diodes towards this aim we are interested in the design of new ligands that can efficiently sensitize lanthanide ions at the same time we are also keen on investigating the electronic and structural effects encountered in the lanthanide complexes when a polymerizable moiety is introduced in the ligandtwo classes of ligands have been developed and are discussed extensively in this work nitro-derivatized and oxazoline-derivatized compounds with thiophene being chosen as the polymerizable moiety the nitro-derivatized ligands further fall into two categories of widely different compounds benzoic acid and 22'-bipyridine the rationale behind the choice of these ligands along with extensive characterization in solid-state and in solution of their lanthanide complexes are presented in this work in addition through this work a new class of highly efficient sensitizers based on the oxazoline compounds has been revealed
