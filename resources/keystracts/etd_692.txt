 this dissertation consists of two chapters regarding marketing information disclosure the first chapter empirically examines firms' voluntary disclosure of marketing information in their communications to the public namely in the management discussion and analysis mda section of their 10-k filings although there are clear standards for what financial information public firms must disclose marketing information disclosure is voluntary in that each firm's management team decides not only whether to disclose marketing-related information but also how much and which particular information to disclose however little is known about the value of voluntary marketing information disclosure indeed the incentive for firms to strategically disclose marketing information in an effort to attain a more positive assessment of their future prospects leads to a series of managerially relevant but unanswered questions to address these questions i assemble a custom data set containing structured ie numerical and unstructured ie textual data from different sources the sample is sufficiently large and comprehensive in that it includes 26572 mda sections disclosed by 4999 public firms between fiscal years 2004 and 2013 i find that marketing information disclosure is fairly prevalent across industries more importantly i find a highly significant and positive relationship between marketing information and firm value in addition i find that firm size moderates the impact of marketing information on firm value with this impact increasing in accordance with firm size somewhat surprisingly i find a large positive effect from hidden marketing information suggesting that the marketing information not explicitly revealed in the mda section eg proprietary information can be even more important than what is revealed overall this study provides important new insights for policy makers firms and individuals eg analysts investorsthe second chapter explores the relationship between managers perceived competition and advertising investment using an innovative measure that is based on firms discussions of competition in their 10-k filings to proxy for managers perceived competition i find a j-shaped relationship between managers perception of the intensity of market competition and the firms advertising investment in the next year further i show that this curvilinear relationship is moderated by macroeconomic conditions in particular economic contractions reinforce the j-shaped relationship overall this research contributes to the marketing-finance literature by identifying a new determinant of advertising investment namely managers perception of competition providing a more nuanced perspective on the competition-investment relationship and highlighting the moderating role played by business cycles moreover my study illustrates that unstructured information disclosed by public firms can be translated into valuable insights
