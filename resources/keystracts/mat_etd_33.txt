graph theory unimodality bilinski diagrams geodesics planar maps a bilinski diagram is a labeling of a planar map with respect to a central vertex and the regional distance of other vertices of the map from that vertex the class g ab [special characters omitted] consists of all 1-ended 3-connected planar graphs with the property that every valence is finite and at least a and every covalence is finite and at least b  a map in the class g ab[special characters omitted] contains no adjacent b-covalent faces and dually a map in the class g ab[special characters omitted] contains no adjacent a-valent vertices it is shown that bilinski diagrams of maps in g63  g44  g36 g53 and g35[special characters omitted] are uniformly concentric ie the set of vertices at regional distance k from the central vertex induce a circuit for each k  1 using this property an algorithm is developed for constructing geodetic double rays or geodesics containing any given edge of a map in g63 g44 or g53[special characters omitted]  a slightly modified algorithm accomplishes the same for maps in g36[special characters omitted]  it follows that all petrie walks in maps in g36[special characters omitted] are geodesics these results contribute to the known classes of maps satisfying a conjecture of bonnington imrich and seifter without the assumption of vertex-transitivity in addition any path in a map in g63 g44 or g36[special characters omitted] that contains at most [12 ph - 2 ] edges incident with any face or superface a union of two faces at least one of which is 3-covalent with their common incident edge removed and at most one edge incident with any 3-covalent face is shown to be the unique geodetic path joining its end-vertices bilinski diagrams are further utilized to show that the distance sequence of any map in g63  g44 or g53[special characters omitted] is unimodal
