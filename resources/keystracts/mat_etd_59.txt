mathematics in this thesis we are concerned with estimating the regularity of \cal a-harmonic differential forms in euclidean space the prototype of the \cal a-harmonic equation is the so-called p-laplacian equation div\vert\nabla f\vert\spp-2\nabla f0 which arises as a nonlinear generalization of the classical dirichlet problem when pn it also serves to characterize quasiconformal functions in chapter 1 we discuss existence and uniqueness questions relating to the latter equation it is natural to consider p-harmonic functions belonging to the sobolev space \cal w\sp1p certain estimates are most easily derived in l\sp2 however so in chapter 2 we prove that when f is a p-harmonic function the vector field \vert\nabla f\vert\spp-1\over2\nabla f\in l\sp2 actually belongs to \cal w\sp12 this is a first step in our proof of the previously unknown fact that \vert\nabla f\vert\spp-2\over2\nabla f belongs to l\sps for some s2 in 2-dimensional euclidean space this higher integrability has as a consequence the famous result of k uhlenbeck and ladyzhenskaya and ural'tseva that p-harmonic functions have holder continuous gradients in chapter 3 we introduce the sobolev spaces of differential forms and the general \cal a-harmonic problem we present a characterization of \cal w\sbsp01p which is naturally adapted to the study of \cal a-harmonic equations that our characterization is equivalent to the classical definition in euclidean space belongs to folklore but the first recorded proof in the setting of riemannian manifolds is due to the author and c scott chapter 4 contains an original extension of morrey's lemma to differential forms which is used to estimate the holder regularity of l\spp\ \cal a-harmonic forms where p is close to n some extensions to riemannian manifolds are extant and others are still in progress we will introduce them in chapter 5 and also mention some directions for future research to expand the applicability of the ideas discussed herein
