giant quantum dots polytypism wurtzite zinc blende researchers have epitaxially grown thick inorganic shells on the surface of quantum dots qds cores to improve quantum yields increase photostability and suppress fluorescence intermittency blinking in giant quantum dots gqds these unique properties make gqds excellent candidates for applications in lasers single molecular probes and solid state leds although a growing wealth of knowledge exists for the photophysical properties of the gqds limited research has been directed towards understanding the synthetic intricacies and crystal growth in this dissertation work i present a detailed study of the growth of cdsecdzns multishell gqds and focus on crystallographic and morphological evolution i studied the effect of core crystalstructure and shell growth was performed on crystallographically disparate w wurtzite and zb zinc blende cdse cores under identical synthetic conditions my work revealed that while shell growth transitioned to w type growth in both cases occurrence of unique w-zb mixed crystallinity polytypism was significant and might result in the final gqds as a consequence of the ligands and reaction conditions involved in the traditional synthesis next i investigated the influence of the shell anion precursor concentrations on gqd growth employing identical w cores by altering the mode of addition and three different sources of sulfur experimental results indicated that delicate interplay of crystal structure preference and ligands involved in the synthesis resulted in varied morphologies rod tripodal trigonal and polyhedral and crystal structures w zb w-zb and zb respectively of gqds in each of the syntheses
