terahertz molecular modeling hydrogen-bonding electrostatic interactions cluster formation experimental terahertz thz spectroscopy and molecular modeling were used to investigate the network of non-covalent interactions that serve to connect molecules in the solution-phase and solid-state the intermolecular forces found in the molecules studied included hydrogen-bonding electrostatic interactions - stacking and long-range dispersion forces these types of non-covalent forces define cluster formation in solution and the packing arrangement of a crystalline solid molecular modeling was utilized to predict the structure and vibrations of the samples and guide the analysis of the experimental data for solution-phase experiments isolated-molecule calculations were carried out using density functional theory dft and second-order mller-plesset perturbation theory mp2 methods solid-state dft using periodic boundary conditions was used to interpret crystalline solids these periodic calculations include the relevant molecular environment found in solids which isolated-molecule calculations can not provide in all cases several density functionals were tested to determine how well they reproduce the experimental observation of structure and thz motions
