rna aptamers oligonucleotide selection cycles high throughput sequencing fixa aptamers are discovered from random oligonucleotide libraries by an   in vitro  selection process usually called selex systematic evolution of   ligands by exponential enrichment the conventional selex method   usually takes multiple rounds of selection and amplification which are   labor-intensive and time-consuming recently developed high-throughput   sequencing hts technologies could offer great advantages in aptamer   discovery here we demonstrated the application of hts in the selection   of rna aptamers which dramatically reduced the number of selection   cycles and greatly shortened the discovery process over-represented   libraries were selected against the target followed by hts where   aptamer candidates were revealed by counting their frequency of   occurrence in fact the known rna aptamer for human factor ixa fixa   was successfully selected from the over-represented m16 chimeric   library after a single round of selection this successful single-pass   aptamer selection could be attributed to three factors   over-representation in the initial library efficient separation in the   partitioning step and the massive number of sequences generated by hts   an unprecedented family of aptamers for fixa with relatively high   affinity  k d    2201100 nm was indentified from   the sparsely represented rna library with m35 in two rounds of   selection where the first round of selection was performed to reduce   complexity and give the subpool over-representation three aptamers   demonstrated substantial inhibition of fixa activity these new m35 rna   aptamers are all consistent with an aptamer motif   q1-l1-q2-l2-q3-l3-q4-tail and they probably form a quadruplex although   observed with low counts the top sequences selected for fixa from an   m22 rna library could form the same qudraplex motif as the new m35  rna  aptamer sequences it appears that the qudraplex motif is favored  by  fixa under current library design and selection conditions
