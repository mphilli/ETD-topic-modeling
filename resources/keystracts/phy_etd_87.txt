flavor changing bottom quark strange quark neutral current using data taken with the cleo ii detector at the cornell electron storage ring cesr we have searched for the effective flavor changing neutral current fcnc decays b\to sl\spl\sp- in an inclusive way we obtain upper limits on the branching ratio \cal bb\to se\spe\sp-57\times10\sp-5\ \cal bb\to s\mu\sp\mu\sp-56\times10\sp-5 and \cal bb\to se\sp\pm\mu\sp\mp22\times10\sp-5 at 90 cl
