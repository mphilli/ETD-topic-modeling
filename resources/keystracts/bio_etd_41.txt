drosophila melanogaster alpha3t proteasome subunit spermatogenesis the proteasome is responsible for degradation of substrates of the ubiquitin pathway 20s proteasomes are cylindrical particles with subunits arranged in a stack of four heptameric rings the outer rings are composed of a subunits and the inner rings are composed of  subunits one major question in proteasome research concerns the extent and nature of proteasome structural heterogeneity to investigate this topic a molecular and genetic study of drosophila proteasomes has been undertaken with a goal of identifying proteasome subunit isoforms exhibiting developmental or cell-type specificity previous work led to the isolation of two proteasome subunit genes encoding 4 isoforms that exhibit testis-specific expression yuan et al 1996 here i report the identification and characterization of a gene  3t  encoding a testis-specific isoform of another 20s proteasome subunit 3the  3t and 3 genes are unlinked and they encode proteins that are 58 identical northern blot analyses reveal that 3 is expressed throughout development in both sexes while  3t is expressed primarily during the pupal and adult stages and only in males the tissue-specific expression pattern was examined in transgenic flies expressing gfp fusion proteins revealing that the testis-specific  3t -gfp only becomes prominent during and after meiosis accumulates in the nucleus at later stages of spermatogenesis and is present in the head of mature motile sperm this pattern is in contrast to that of 3-gfp which is expressed in all tissues examined in testes 3-gfp is prominently expressed in early stages of spermatogenesis in the cytosol and nucleus but it fades from the elongating spermatid nuclei as the  3t subunit accumulates  3t can functionally replace its yeast ortholog and thus encodes a functional proteasome subunit ectopic constitutive expression of  3t in flies causes dominant pupal lethality while expressing the 3 gene in the same way has no detectable consequence suggesting that the  3t subunit is functionally distinct from 3 in an attempt to silence  3t gene expression an inverted repeat of a portion of the  3t gene  3t-ir  was expressed in flies using the uasgal4 system the expressed  3t-ir caused a dominant pupal lethality instead of the anticipated male sterility phenotype
