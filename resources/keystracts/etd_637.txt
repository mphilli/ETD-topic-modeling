 topology and geometry provide a unique perspective to study many systems in this thesis we discuss three distinct soft condensed matter systems i elastic shells including topological defects on an elastic shell and how the symmetry of defect structures affects a shells ability to sustain external pressure ii droplet sheets including how defects and curvature drive a square-to-triangular lattice transition in a droplet network iii atomically-thin membranes including the effective bending rigidity of a fluctuating ribbon and a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon of a vibrating flap in i as perfect crystalline order is incompatible with spherical topology defects need to be introduced for any triangulation of a 2-sphere we study how the stability of spherical crystalline shells under external pressure is influenced by the defect structure in particular we compare stability for shells with a minimal set of twelve 1 disclinations to shells with extended defect arrays grain boundary scars with non-vanishing net disclination charge we find that the critical pressure at which shells collapse is lowered for scarred configurations that break icosahedral symmetry and raised for scars that preserve icosahedral symmetry the particular shapes which arise from breaking of an initial icosahedrally-symmetric shell depend on the f oppl-von k arm an number in ii motivated by a recent experiment that prints tens of thousands of micron-sized aqueous droplets that bind by forming single lipid bilayers to form a cohesive network in bulk oil we propose that this system is a model system to study lattice transitions that take place for example in colloidal crystals in particular we study the square-to-triangular lattice transition in 2d networks where the transition is driven either by the explicit insertion of defects or by curving an initially flat lattice in iii we use molecular dynamics to study the vibration of a thermally fluctuating 2d elastic ribbon clamped at both ends we identify the eigenmodes from peaks in the frequency domain and track the dependence of the eigen-frequency of a given mode on the bending rigidity of the ribbon with thermal contraction being taken care of we define an effective bending rigidity using eigen-frequency and discuss the applicability of previous renormalization bending rigidity theory to the effective bending rigidity experimental realizations include two-dimensional atomically thin membranes such as graphene see a recent experiment and molybdenum disulfide or polymerized membranes in the simulation of a flap we find a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon where the flap vibrates about a tilt plane in the upper or lower spacethis thesis contains some unpublished results some problems need further exploration
