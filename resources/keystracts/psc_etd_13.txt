negotiation confrontation china taiwan policy policy redirection nineteen 90s china's taiwan policymaking in the 1990s was characterized by a cyclical nature in which the policy line repeatedly fluctuated between negotiation and confrontation beijing decided to negotiate with taiwan in june 1991 it turned to confront taiwan in june 1995 it decided to re-negotiate in late 1997 it again accepted a coercive policy in july 1999most previous studies of china-taiwan relations have failed to explain this phenomenon since they do not pay enough attention to the function of the chinese leadership's perceptions of situations in the decision-making process this dissertation seeks to formulate a new research framework that by focusing on the official chinese perceptions can map out the linkages between external stimuli the decision-making process and policy outcomes on the empirical level it aims to explain beijing's different responses to taipei's similar stimuli and the above four decisions of policy change the central argument is twofold first the stimulus-response model cannot explain the china-taiwan interactions because the chinese leadership selectively perceives the situations second the chinese leadership's perceptions of the us will condition the ways they perceive and react to taipei's initiativesdrawing on a quantitative content analysis of the official newspaper of the chinese communist party remin ribao this dissertation demonstrates that neither taipei's actions nor beijing's perceptions of taiwan consistently align with those policy redirections instead there is a significant correlation with a three to six-month time lag between beijing's perceptions of the us and its perceptions of taiwan beijing's perceptions of the us also positively associate with its taiwan policy directions on the other hand by employing the method of case comparisons this dissertation examines beijing's perceptions of external situation within the shorter time-periods prior to six cases of taiwan policy decisions the results conclude that beijing's perceptions of the us are consistent with its taiwan policy outcomes that is when the leadership in beijing perceives a friendly sino-american relationship the chinese government is more likely to adopt a reconciliatory policy toward taiwan when they perceive a deteriorating relationship with the us it is more likely that a confrontational taiwan policy will be accepted
