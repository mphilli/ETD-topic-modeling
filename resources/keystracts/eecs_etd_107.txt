interdomain traffic bandwidth diffserv internet as the internet evolves and new bandwidth-consuming multimedia applications become more common it becomes necessary to provide quality of service qos in the internet qos provides a basis for network providers to offer a variety of services to customers with different cost bandwidth latency and jitter requirements which makes the network resources more valuable to utilize valuable network resources efficiently service providers need to engineer intra-domain and inter-domain traffic in this dissertation we are addressing the inter-domain traffic engineering problem with emphasis on inter-domain qos routing which is the most important component of traffic engineeringthis dissertation introduces a novel inter-domain qos routing scheme that can scale over large networks our scheme is based on the notion of regions which are collections of autonomous systems and we represent the overall internet topology as a collection of regions without introducing a hierarchy we employed a link-state based source specified routing protocol inside regions edge-to-edge paths are calculated as a concatenation of subpaths that are calculated by individual domains in different regions we analyzed the scalability and path calculation capability of our routing approach analysis results indicate a tradeoff between the computation communication and storage scalability and the length of a calculated path but the gain from the scalability always outweighs the loss from the increased path length we extended an existing signaling protocol by adding explicit path setup generic qos support and inter-domain label exchange capabilities we also explained how this protocol can be used to exchange inter-domain labels and how this can be used to establish an inter-domain label switched path finally we introduced an inter-domain traffic engineering architecture which comprises of the components we mentioned above and explained how inter-domain qos routing signaling and path establishment is coordinated through a bandwidth broker to provide an inter-domain traffic engineering capability we analyzed the effectiveness of the traffic engineering approach through simulations and results suggest that our architecture can efficiently utilize inter-domain resources if qos requirements can be met
