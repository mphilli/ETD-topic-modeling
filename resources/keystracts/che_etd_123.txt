organic chemistry sulfer dioxide sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate rongalite is a derivative of the unsymmetrical sulfoxylic acid hso\sb2- and is used as a source of reduced species of sulfur dioxide my work involved the development of a better solvent system than had previously been used with rongalite and employment of it in optimizing the yields and determining the mechanisms of the reactions of rongalite with organic halides rongalite is reacted with organic halides as a slurry in a polar aprotic solvent such as nn-dimethylformamide dmf or 13-dimethyl-3456-tetrahydro-21h-pyrimidinone nn-dimethylpropyleneurea dmpu the best method is the use of a slurry of rongalite in dmf or dmpu with a phase transfer agent tetrabutylammonium bromidetreatment of benzyl bromide 4-cyanobenzyl bromide and 1-bromodecane with rongalite in dmf give symmetrical sulfones in good yields treatment of \alpha\alpha\sp\prime-dichloro-o-xylene or \alpha\alpha\sp\prime-dibromo-o-xylene with rongalite in dmf gives 23-benzoxathiin-3-oxide and a polymeric o-xylylene use of a phase transfer agent tetrabutylammonium bromide in the dmf during the reaction of \alpha\alpha\sp\prime-dihalo-o-xylene with rongalite gives 23-benzoxathiin-3-oxide in good yieldstreatment of allyl bromide with rongalite in dmf gives bis-allyl sulfone and propene use of excess so\sb2 or a nucleophilic catalyst sodium iodide in this reaction generates good yields of bis-allyl sulfonetreatment of phenacyl chloride with rongalite in dmf gives acetophenone in good yield treatment of phenacyl bromide with rongalite in dmf gives a mixture of acetophenone and 14-diphenyl-14-butanedione 14-diphenyl-14-butanedione is generated when the same reaction is run in the presence of a drying agent such as calcium hydride or anhydrous magnesium sulfate treatment of phenacyl bromide with rongalite and excess so\sb2 in dmf gives a mixture of acetophenone 14-diphenyl-14-butanedione and bisphenacyl sulfonerongalite reacts with 4-nitrobenzyl bromide to generate different products depending upon the reaction conditions treatment of 4-nitrobenzyl bromide with rongalite and sodium or potassium bicarbonate in a dmfh\sb2o solution gives 44\sp\prime-dinitrobibenzyl in good yield treatment of 4-nitrobenzyl bromide with rongalite and sodium or potassium bicarbonate in dmf or a dmpuh\sb2o solution gives bis4-nitrobenzyl sulfone in good yieldstreatment of benzal bromide with rongalite in dmf gives a mixture of trans-stilbene and 12-dibromo-12-diphenylethane treatment of the latter with rongalite in dmf gives trans-stilbene in good yield treatment of hexabromobenzene with rongalite in dmf gives a mixture of pentabromobenzene and isomeric tetrabromobenzenes
