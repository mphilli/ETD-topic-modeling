bankruptcy bureaucratic costs corporate governance corporate strategy directors diversification this dissertation makes two important contributions to literature  on organizational failure the first study explores the relationship between a  firm's corporate diversification strategy and its vulnerability to failure  bankruptcy and the second study explores the likelihood of reemergence from  the governance perspective         in the first study i show that there is a significant difference  between the bureaucratic costs incurred by bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms my  results suggest that the likelihood of a firm going bankrupt significantly  increases as its bureaucratic costs increase these results provide robust  support for resource dependence predictions and highlight the important role  implementation plays in the success of corporate strategy ie if a firm  incurs bureaucratic costs that offset the synergistic benefits it derives from  its diversification profile its performance is likely to be suboptimal and  prone to failure my study further shows that higher related diversification  especially when combined with higher bureaucratic costs makes firms most  vulnerable to failure         in the second study i show that when resourceful directors are  actively involved in the firm's business a firm's likelihood of reemergence  goes up significantly further the relationship between directors' resourceful  interlinks and reemergence likelihood is curvilinear such that too few or too  many linkages reduce the likelihood of reemergence finally i also show that  nature of resources useful to firms is contingent on the nature of the business  the firm is in ie while resourceful insiders are valuable to firms in  knowledge-intensive industries resourceful outsiders are more valuable to firms  in knowledge-mundane industries overall this study extends resource dependence  perspective and provides a more robust and contextualized understanding of  directors' impact on firm performance
