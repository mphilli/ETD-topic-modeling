data processing debugging java bytecode visualization we devise a widely applicable debugging approach to deal with the prevailing issue that bugs cannot be precisely reproduced in nondeterministic complex concurrent programs a distinct efficient record-and-playback mechanism is designed to record all the internal states of execution including intermediate results by injecting our own bytecode which does not affect the source code and through a two-step data processing mechanism these data will be aggregated structured and parallel processed for the purpose of replay in high fidelity while keeping the overhead at a satisfactory level docker and git are employed to create a clean environment such that the execution will be undertaken repeatedly with a maximum precision of reproducing bugs in our development several other forefront technologies such as mongodb spark and nodejs are utilized and smoothly integrated for easy implementation altogether we develop a system for java debugging execution visualization and verification jdevv a debugging tool for java although our debugging approach can apply to other languages as well jdevv also offers an aggregated and interactive visualization for the ease of users code verification
