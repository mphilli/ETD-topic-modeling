online web users optimal flow this study explored on-line web users' optimal flow experience to increase our understanding of positive aspects of web users' on-line behaviors and the flow phenomenon csikszentmihalyi 1975b the success of this study will expand the scope of flow theory applications enhance the coherence of flow theory increase the understanding of web users' on-line experience and acquire knowledge of effective web designsthe digital version of the experience sampling method was employed to collect situated data from 405 web users with a repeatedly pop-up questionnaire on subjects' web browsersthe four hypotheses investigating the interactions between flow experience situational contexts and flow dimensions are as follows hypothesis 1 is equivalence of perceived challenges and skills associated with flow experience in the web environment hypothesis 2 can flow dimensions predict overall flow in the web environment hypothesis 3 is there a relationship between web users' flow state and their flow symptoms hypothesis 4 is there an underlying structure among flow dimensionsthis study concludes that first the relative distance between challenges and skills is likely to be a factor in determining respondents' optimal experience though the assumption that the equivalence of challenges and skills can facilitate the occurrence of flow cannot be concluded second the flow dimensions which are highly inter-correlated make substantial and meaningful contribution in predicting web users' flow experience among the flow dimensions concentration telepresence and loss of self-consciousness are the most powerful predicators third web users' flow state which consisted of the three flow quotations are very good predicators and make equal contribution in predicting web users' flow symptoms this verifies the validity of the quotations in eliciting people's flow experience fourth an underlying structure of web users' flow experience is found three important factors were extracted from flow dimensions representing the points of entry subsistence and exit of flowfindings in this study provide insights into web users' internal behaviors and the process of approaching optimal flow experience several general but practical recommendations are provided for web users and web designers in facilitating the occurrence of flow and increasing the effectiveness of web use besides several concepts of flow theory were examined verified and expanded methodologically the on-line experience sampling method was proven to be a useful and practical data collection tool
