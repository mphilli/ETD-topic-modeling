 this dissertation consists of three chaptersthe first chapter develops an individual choice model to incorporate the extremeness aversion phenomenon which refers to people's tendency to avoid extreme options i follow a revealed preference approach and instead of involving any exogenous structures eg attributes to describe options or identify extreme ones i deduce both preferences and extremeness endogenously from observed choices my first result employs extremeness aversion to explain choice situations with revealed context effects and is also applicable to choice situations where the standard revealed preference theory applies without referring to further structures i provide a choice-theoretical justification for extremeness the second result sharpens this characterization by imposing a more concrete structure a linear order to identify extreme options in particular i strengthen the previous choice-theoretical justification and derive a linear order defined on the universal set of options we describe an individual as if she consistently exhibits extremeness aversion with respect to the linear order a concrete situation addressed by the second result is the experimental design applied to test the extremeness aversion phenomenon options are portrayed by two attributes to formally incorporate extremeness aversion with options represented by two attributes i propose a two-stage process my third result characterizes the two-stage process by obtaining the attributes endogenously accordingly i interpret it as extremeness aversion with revealed attributespart of the study of the two-dimensional result of the first chapter is related to a more general problem although the first chapter embedded the question into the context of individual decision-making the same question can be also rephrased in terms of collective decision-making which is formally presented and fully answered in my second chapter intuitively suppose that we can observe the relation aggregated from preferences of a group of two agents but we are ignorant about the individual agents' preferences under what kind of conditions the aggregated relation is consistent with the pareto dominance relation the pareto dominance relation of a preference profile is the asymmetric part of a partial order in the second chapter i use two independent conditions to characterize when the asymmetric part of a partial order defined on a finite set of options can be represented as the pareto dominance relation of a two-agent preference profilemore generally for any integer n the problem of the existence of an n-agent preference profile that generates the given pareto dominance relation is to investigate the dimension of the partial order in the third chapter i provide a general characterization for an n-dimensional partial order
