apatite tephrochronology bentonite ash fall beds initial studies of late ordovician tephra k-bentonites have demonstrated the potential for utilizing trace element concentrations in apatite as ash-fall bed discriminators to test the utility of apatite trace element tephrochronology on a large scale we studied over 200 k-bentonite samples from the late ordovician of eastern north america and scandinavia in addition we studied unaltered volcanic samples from various locations around the world on the basis of electron microprobe epma and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry la-icp-ms results the resulting apatite trace element data are shown to provide unique bed discriminators despite within-crystal variability intra-sample heterogeneity and effects of low-grade regional metamorphism each of the tephra layers possesses unique and reproducible trends in mg cl mn fe ce and y concentrations in apatite results from epma show comparable precision for mg and mn against analyses from la-icp-ms further results from la-icp-ms show the potential of sr u pb and rare earth elements ree ratios as powerful bed discriminators results from apatite analyses of the late ordovician have provided 12 correlated k-bentonite beds over an estimated 5 ma-duration which provide a significant improvement of stratigraphic resolution five of these beds are new wintergreen park queen street riverton fischer hill and nittany k-bentonites in addition our data indicate that the brannon k-bentonite formerly known only in the lexington limestone of kentucky is equivalent to the paradise k-bentonite which is locally developed in ny within the lower part of the indian castle shale and that the haldane k-bentonite located within the upper dunleith formation in the upper mississippi valley is equivalent to the manheim k-bentonite uppermost dolgeville formation in new york and lower antes shale in central pennsylvania our findings also indicate that the millbrig north america and kinnekulle scandinavia k-bentonites are not from a single eruption the stratigraphic relations revealed by these new k-bentonite fingerprints substantially alter previous interpretation of sequence and chemostratigraphic correlations in eastern laurentia
