plane curve singularities constant class this dissertation considers the geometry of the locus of constant class in the deformation spaces of plane curve singularities in [dh] diaz and harris discuss the geometry of the equisingular  es  equigeneric  eg  and equiclassical  ec  loci in the same deformation spaces we define the locus of constant class ek as the locus which parametrizes deformations of constant class by definition ek contains ec  we investigate and answer the question is ek equal to ec we define conditions for ek to be different from ec and then explore the singularities where this might be possible for y 2  x n  0 we are able to show where ek is different from ec  we also compute the tangent cones for the different pieces of ek and hence for ek itself in many cases investigating the y 3  x n  0 singularities in search of the extra pieces of ek leads to the definition of the pre-ek loci  each of which possibly contains a piece of ek and other loci we explore the possibilities for these other loci finally leading up to the double triple point locus in one of the pre-ek loci for y 3  x 6  0
