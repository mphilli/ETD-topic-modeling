acoustics animal behavior animal communication anthropogenic noise harbor seals marine mammals harbor seals phoca vitulina are a widely distributed pinniped species that mate underwater  similar to other aquatically mating pinnipeds male harbor seals produce vocalizations during the breeding season that function in male-male interactions and possibly as an attractant for females  i investigated multiple aspects of these reproductive advertisement displays in a population of harbor seals in glacier bay national park and preserve alaska  first i looked at vocal production as a function of environmental variables including season daylight and tidal state  vocalizations were highly seasonal and detection of these vocalizations peaked in june and july which correspond with the estimated time of breeding  vocalizations also varied with light with the lowest probability of detection during the day and the highest probability of detection at night  the high probability of detection corresponded to when females are known to forage  these results are similar to the vocal behavior of previously studied populations  however unlike previously studied populations the detection of harbor seal breeding vocalizations did not vary with tidal state  this is likely due to the location of the hydrophone as it was not near the haul out and depth was therefore not significantly influenced by changes in tidal height  i also investigated the source levels and call parameters of vocalizations as well as call rate and territoriality  the average source level of harbor seal breeding vocalizations was 144 db re 1 pa at 1 m and measurements ranged from 129 to 149 db re 1 pa  analysis of call parameters indicated that vocalizations of harbor seals in glacier bay were similar in duration to other populations but were much lower in frequency  during the breeding season there were two discrete calling areas that likely represent two individual males the average call rate in these display areas was approximately 1 call per minute  the harbor seal breeding season also overlaps with peak tourism in glacier bay and the majority of tourists visit the park on a motorized vessel  because of this overlap i investigated the impacts of vessel noise on the vocal behavior of individual males  in the presence of vessel noise male harbor seals increase the amplitude of their vocalizations decrease the duration and increase the minimum frequency  these vocal shifts are similar to studies of noise impacts on other species across taxa but it is unknown how this could impact the reproductive success of male harbor seals  finally i looked at the role of female preference for male vocalizations  using playbacks of male vocalizations to captive female harbor seals i found that females have a higher response to vocalizations that correspond to dominant males  females were less responsive to subordinate male vocalizations which had a shorter duration and a higher frequency  given that male harbor seals decrease the duration and increase the frequency of vocalizations in the presence of noise it is possible that these vocalizations become less attractive in noise
