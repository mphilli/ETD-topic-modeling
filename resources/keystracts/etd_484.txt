aesthetics affect criticalcultural studies embodiment queer studies social movements turning toward affective and emotional manifestations of resistance this project engages riot grrrl cultural production including zines flyers lyrics and performances  positioning these artifacts and enactments as a specifically queer feminist praxis i hone in on grrrl relationality and collectivity as the embodied space where political imaginings are carried out  after first establishing the riot grrrl movement as a primarily affectively configured movement i focus specifically on the mobilization of anger and intimacy within the movement  first i position anger as an emotion that enables a queering of patriarchal protection culture that the grrrls mobilize to subvert cultural logics of fear and established relations to state institutions of protection  i argue that the mobilization of anger enables the grrrls to implement different practices of protection within the movement as an enactment of grrrl relationality  second i locate intimacy through expressions of admiration friendship and desire  here i highlight how the grrrls entangled friendship admiration and affiliation with an awareness of erotic possibility opening the door for indefinite queer relations  i describe this way of being riot grrrl as a grrrl crush using the term as a politicized designation of the particularities of riot grrrl relationality as they identify and publically articulate their admiration and desire for other women and girls  taken together i argue that focusing on these affective practices enables an understanding of what it means to enact riot grrrl  ultimately this uncovers the political imaginings that propelled the movement forward and forged a process of becoming that allowed new queer intimacies relations and collective ways of being to emerge
