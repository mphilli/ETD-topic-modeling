electron-positron hadron cross section lambdab we have searched for [special characters omitted] resonance production using data taking by cleo iii detector and set an upper limit for such a cross section to be on the order of 005-010 units of r  in 95 confidence level in the scanning range at center mass of energies from 11230 to 11382 gev the measurement of  r    e    e   -  [arrow right] hadrons e     e  -  [arrow right]     -   has been made in this scan range as well the measured  r  value near   b   threshold is  r   401  015
