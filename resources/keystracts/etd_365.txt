blood pressure emotion emotional dampening emotion response emotion research has benefited from standardized sets of emotional expressions compared to the wealth of research on the recognition of static displays of emotion only a few studies have examined dynamic information presentation  the amsterdam dynamic facial expression set adfes is a set of emotion stimuli that contains video clips of standardized expressions of emotions van der schalk et al 2011  in the phase 1 pilot study psychometric properties of the adfes were examined with a sample of 110 college students  the most accurate and reliable emotion stimuli were used in phase 2 in which the link between blood pressure and emotion response and recognition was examined  one perspective of this link emphasizes an overall dampening of emotional responses to affect-laden stimuli mccubbin et al 2011 whereas another emphasizes perceiving emotions in a way that maximizes positive affect and minimizes negative affect jorgensen johnson kolodziej  schreer 1996  to compare these theoretical perspectives phase 2 sought to examine the relationships between resting bp and the recognition and response to dynamic facial stimuli   analyses showed that systolic bp   26 t  230 p  02 was a significant predictor of the valance rating assigned to surprise stimuli and diastolic bp   22 t  202 p  05 was a significant predictor of the arousal rating assigned to joy stimuli  further regression analyses revealed that diastolic bp   -30 t  -284 p  006 was inversely associated with the accuracy of the appraisal fear stimuli  finally regression analyses also revealed that systolic bp   34 t  292 p  01 was a significant predictor of reaction time when viewing anger stimuli and disgust stimuli   29 t  259 p  01 these results are consistent with a bias toward accentuating positive emotions while minimizing acknowledgement of negative emotions  research directions related to response dampening versus positive response bias are discussed
