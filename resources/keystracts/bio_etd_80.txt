charge syndrome chd7 development rna-seq spinal deformity zebrafish the chromodomain helicase dna binding protein chd family consists of a group of nine known proteins that function in controlling dna dynamics and transcription the chd family member of interest in this work chromodomain helicase dna-binding protein 7 chd7 has been implicated in human charge coloboma of the eye heart defects atresia of the choanae retardation of growth andor development genital andor urinary abnormalities and ear abnormalities and deafness syndrome and idiopathic scoliosis however little is known about the roles this gene plays during developmentusing zebrafish as a model system morpholino antisense technology whole mount in situ hybridization wish and a relatively new protocol rna-seq we provide evidence of several developmental defects resulting from chd7 knockdown as well as describe several genes that exhibit significant differential expression upon chd7 knockdown we provide evidence that zebrafish embryos highly express chd7 in the retina brain and somite boundaries we demonstrate that a reduction in chd7 synthesis results in laterality defects in the expression of somitogenesis genes consistent with the hypothesis that this chromatin remodeler is necessary for the proper development of the long axis of the body and may be involved in the onset of human scoliosis we show that the presence of chd7 is crucial for proper neural retinal and vertebral development in zebrafish and that loss of function of chd7 resulted in several morphological defects similar to those observed in human patients with charge syndromefinally this work is the first transcriptome-wide study analyzing genetic changes in response to knockdown of a member of the chromodomain helicase dna binding protein family using rna-seq we were able to identify and quantify differentially expressed genes in chd7 morphant zebrafish embryos compared to control morphant zebrafish embryos these data were consistent with our knockdown experiments as well as with putative roles for chd7 in human diseasesin an effort to make a broader impact we extended the use of zebrafish beyond scientific research and described several different methods of using zebrafish in the undergraduate laboratory classroom first we described the use of wish in the classroom to help students form connections between molecular and organismal biology and then described the use of two model organisms zebrafish and c elegans in the classroom to help students understand how genes and the environment interact to affect organismal developmentcumulatively this work is an example of interdisciplinary study both in the research laboratory as well as in the classroom it involves the intensive study of a chromatin remodeler chd7 and makes important connections between chd7 knockdown in zebrafish and human diseases it also describes the pedagogical advantages of model organisms with respect to providing a rich and integrative experience for undergraduate biology majors
