practical agency german idealism fichte johann gottlieb striving i provide a reconstructive interpretation of fichte's theory of practical agency based primarily on a close examination of texts of the so-called later jena wissenschaftslehre   mainly the 1798 published system der sittenlehre  and the 1796-9 series of lecture-cycles entitled wissenschaftslehre nova methodo   wlnm  recorded in two extant sets of student transcripts i argue that the reason commentators of the first half of the last century fail to put together a satisfactory theory is because they did not sufficiently recognize the importance of the wlnm  and did not enjoy the retrospective vantage point with which thorough and incisive studies of it have since provided us for approaching the principle of striving of the 17945 grundlage der gesammten wissenschaftslehre  to this extent my project also involves clarifying the role of striving in accounting for practical agency from this vantage pointi argue that fichte does not regard striving to be directly constitutive of our empirical actions as a precondition of consciousness striving is preconscious since time is itself an appearance erscheinung for the transcendental philosopher striving should properly be understood in terms of timeless agency it does not bear any obvious relation to the everyday temporally conditioned actions of which we are conscious and morally accountable or even our conscious acting itself the freedom of striving is comparable to kant's transcendental freedom which fichte identifies with the moral freedom of the pure will as early as 1793 it constitutes the law of practical reason or moral demand by which each of our ethical vocation is stipulated in other words the freedom of striving does not so much constitute the freedom of our choice to do x or x viz the freedom of arbitrary choice [libertas arbitrii] as it does its transcendental ground only in the sittenlehre and the wlnm does fichte come to secure the transcendental ideality and thereby empirical reality of our libertas arbitrii by demonstrating that it has a transcendental ground in striving as kant tries to do the same with respect to space time and the objective unity of apperception--what i dub fichte's transcendental approach to practical agency
