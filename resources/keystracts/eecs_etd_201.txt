resistive networks this thesis concerns the use of nonlinear resistive networks for solving ill-posed problems in computer vision the particular problems considered are surface reconstruction edge detection stereo vision optical flow computation and shape-from- shading ill-posed problems in early vision can be reformulated as optimization problems through regularization since many of the optimization problems in early vision are non-convex it is difficult to solve them by using ordinary gradient descent algorithms also the optimization problems in early vision often require much computing power in this thesis we propose variable nonlinear resistive vnr networks that can be used for solving non-convex optimization problems a vnr network is a resistive network that includes variable nonlinear multi-terminal resistors since they are resistive networks they can easily be simulated on a parallel computer and may also be implemented on vlsi circuitsin this study vnr networks that can be used to minimize non-convex functions are described and conditions for the unique solution are given we show that the graduated non-convexity gnc algorithm and the mean field annealing mfa algorithm can be implemented on this network and we give some of the simulation results to show that vnr networks can be used for general optimization problems we use them for solving the traveling salesman problem we also apply these networks to edge detection surface reconstruction stereo matching optical flow computation and shape-form-shading problems the networks give stable solutions for each problemby theoretical developments and computer simulation we demonstrate that the proposed vnr network is a very flexible and powerful method to solve non-convex optimization problems
