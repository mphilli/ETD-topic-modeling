commutative algebra representation theory orders are a certain class of noncommutative algebras over commutative rings originallydefined by auslander and bridger an r-order is an r-algebra which is a maximal cohenmacaulayr-module in this thesis we consider orders  over cohen-macaulay local ringsr possessing a canonical module r in this case a great deal of structure is imposed on in chapter 3 we focus on the use of orders as noncommutative resolutions of commutativelocal rings this idea was introduced by van den bergh [45] for r gorenstein and weinvestigate the generalization to the case where r is cohen-macaulay we show that ifan order is totally reflexive over r and has finite global dimension then r was alreadygorenstein further we investigate gorenstein orders and give a necessary and sufficientcondition for the endomorphism ring endrr   to be a gorenstein orderthe rest of the thesis focuses on various aspects of the representation theory of orderswe investigate orders which have finite global dimension on the punctured spectrum butare not necessarily isolated singularities in this case we are able to prove a generalizationof auslanders theorem about finite cm type [3] we prove that if an order which satisfiesprojdimop  6 n possesses only finitely many indecomposable nth syzygies of mcm -modules then in fact gldim p 6 n  dim rp for all non-maximal primes p we are thenable to translate this to a condition on r by considering path algebras since these maintainfiniteness of global dimensionfinally we consider orders which are true isolated singularities and iyamas higherauslander-reiten theory [27] we consider the action of n on n-orthogonal subcategoriesof cm  and on n-cluster tilting subcategories for the former we are able to characterizethe projective dimension of duals of modules for the latter we provide an obstruction to amodule being n-periodic a question of great interest for the representation theory of ordersof finite global dimension
