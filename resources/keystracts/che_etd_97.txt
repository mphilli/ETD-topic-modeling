alkenes tellurium allylic alcohols allylic amines a novel methodology for the stereospecific syntheses of alkenes from 12 cyclic sulfates via tellurium chemistry has been discovered meso -23-diphenylethane-23-diol [arrow right] cis stilbene dl -23-diphenylethane-23-diol [arrow right] trans -stilbene compared with other procedures advantages of this method include 1 the use of mild temperatures 0c to room temperature 2 the rapidity of the reaction 10 min to 2 h 3 stereo specificity 4 the recovery of te o  and 5 the adaptability of the reaction to the use of catalytic amount of te 01 equivtellurium mediated nucleophilic reduction under no-solvent conditions have been investigated systematically secondary and tertiary allylic alcohols were synthesized with different substitution patterns by no-solvent reactions in excellent yieldsa new telluride phase transfer catalysis process has been developed and successfully applied to the syntheses of secondary and tertiary allylic alcohols a catalytic amount of te o can be used previous regiochemistry problems were overcome by this procedure epoxycinnamyl tosylate gave 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol exclusively in 98 yield one of the attractive features is easy workup--the toluene organic phase is removed and concentrated to give pure allylic alcohols a chiral phase transfer catalyst was tried but no asymmetric induction was found from racemic starting materialsa general efficient procedure has been found to synthesize racemic and non-racemic secondary and tertiary allylic amines via tellurium chemistry from activated aziridines the syntheses of racemic allylic amines involve three steps starting from allylic alcohols the synthesis of chiral allylic amines was completed using sharpless' aminohydroxylation or asymmetric epoxidation procedurea new domino tellurium mediated nucleophilic reduction and michael addition has been discovered for the synthesis of oxygen-containing heterocycles a synthesis of a highly functionized racemic isohydrobenzofuran has been completed through five steps chiral heterocycles can be conveniently prepared using sharpless' asymmetric epoxidation
