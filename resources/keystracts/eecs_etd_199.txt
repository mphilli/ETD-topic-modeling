simulated annealing hill climbing attributed strings shape matching genetic algorithms this dissertation presents an approach for shape matching that is based on genetic algorithms gas shape recognition is a challenging task especially for shapes of objects that are occluded or touch or overlap with other objects in our approach the problem of shape matching is viewed as an optimization problem we use attributed strings to represent shapes this dissertation addresses the task of shape matching rather than issues related to preprocessing and feature extraction different ga operators and different selection procedures are compared a variety of tests is performed to evaluate the robustness of ga with small and large databases the ga approach is compared to simulated annealing and 'memetic' annealing which is an extension of simulated annealing with hill climbing a new population based approach called particle swarm optimization pso is analyzed and a discrete version is proposed this approach is also compared with the ga experimental results show that the steady state ga using all operators crossover mutation and hill climbing performs best
