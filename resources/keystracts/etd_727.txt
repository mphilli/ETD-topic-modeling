high dimensional factor model long-term risk misspecification number of factors recovery theorem this dissertation examines misspecification issues in two contexts i signal or equivalently factor detection in high-dimensional factor models and ii the identification of the physical probability distribution of stock returns in the asset pricing literaturethe first essay revisits the panel information criteria ic proposed by bai and ng 2002 which is a popular estimator for the number of factors in high-dimensional factor models and studies its over-detection risk in finite samples first we analyze the finite sample performance of ic by computing the over-detection probability bound in particular we specify the asymptotic over-detection condition of ic in terms of eigenvalues coming from pure noise and then derive the computable formula for a non-asymptotic upper bound on the overestimation probability by adopting random matrix theory we show that unless the sample size is sufficiently large the overestimation probability is not negligible even for the case in which factors have strong explanatory power second we show that for small sample sizes the over-detection risk of ic is significantly reduced by the degrees of freedom adjustment in the penalty of the original criteria finally we propose modified information criteria mic as a practical guide to improving the finite sample performance of ic simulations show that our mic outperforms ic for the case with weakly serially or cross-sectionally correlated errors as well as iid errorsthe second essay examines the misdetection risk of the panel information criteria ic proposed by bai and ng 2002 for detecting the number of factors in high-dimensional factor models and examines the optimal penalty to minimize an upper bound on the misdetection probability of the ic estimator in finite samples this study extends the first chapter which analyzed the finite sample performance of the ic estimator regarding its over-detection risk to the comprehensive misdetection risk considering under-detection risk as well we derive the computable formula for a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misdetection probability by employing recent results from random matrix theory using the formula we analyze the misdetection risk of the ic estimator and achieve the minimum upper bound of the misdetection probability by finding the optimal weight for the penalty function our numerical examples suggest that modified criteria with the optimized penalization improve the finite sample performance of the original ic estimatorin my third essay we revisit the recovery theorem on the identification of the physical probability distribution of stock returns proposed by ross 2015 first its applicability in fixed-income markets is considered we suggest a new procedure for applying the recovery theorem to the gaussian affine term structure as a result we can recover a particular probability distribution and decompose forward rates into the investors' short-rate expectations and term premia under this recovered probability measure next the reliability of the recovery theorem is examined in particular we study its misspecification issue in line with the claim of misspecified recovery by borovika hansen and scheinkman 2015 our empirical result verifies that what ross really recovers is not the physical probability but the long-term risk-neutral probability which absorbs compensation for exposure to permanent shocks in consequence we can decompose forward term premia into nearly constant short-term risk premia associated with transitory shocks and highly volatile long-term risk premia corresponding to permanent shocks finally we find that a secular decline in forward rates is mostly attributed to investors' short-rate expectations under the long-term risk-neutral probability measure and all important variations in term premia can be captured by long-term risk premia concisely long-term risk matters for asset pricing
