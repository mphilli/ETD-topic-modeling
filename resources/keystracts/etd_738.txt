dye-sensitized solar cells electron reservoir photovoltaics polypyridine ruthenium up-conversion increasing the usable portion of solar spectrum is a key factor in increasing the efficiency of modern solar cells  the near-ir region of the solar spectrum is often underutilized as a means of energy production as the photons in this region do not contain enough energy to promote electrons to the conducting band of common semiconductors used in photovoltaics  to help achieve this goal the creation of an electron reservoir was attempted the electron reservoir would be a holding place for an electron that is excited by a sub-bandgap photon until another photon excites it to the conduction bandthe first chapter of this dissertation describes the basics of dye-sensitized solar cell technology and the requirements and characteristics of an electron reservoir it also discusses characteristics that molecules would need to have in order to act as electron reservoirs  the electron reservoirs envisioned consist of multi-metal complexes with at least three metal centers and the presence of a near-ir absorption in the mixed-valence statethe second chapter describes the synthesis of a number mono- and diruthenium of building blocks that were used to create larger triruthenium molecules  most notable of these was bis44-dicarboxy-22-bipyridine22-bipyrimidinerutheniumii hexafluorophosphate  the two 44-dicarboxy-22-bipyridine ligands allow strong attachment of the complex to tio2 and the 22-bipyrimidine ligand allows for additional ruthenium centers to be attachedthe third chapter describes the creation of a series of triruthenium complexes  initially an unsuccessful combinatorial synthesis was attempted using tio2 as a stationary phase afterwards a series of triruthenium complexes were made using the mono- and diruthenium building blocks previously made  none of the complexes synthesized had a near-ir absorption in their mixed-valence statethe fourth chapter describes the synthesis of a cyclometalated diruthenium complex made using 2356-tetra-2-pyridylpyridine as a bridging ligand  a strong mixed-valence near-ir absorbance was seen at 1370 nmthe fifth chapter describes the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells and the photovoltaic results obtained using the dyes from chapters two through four  the solar cells tested had efficiencies of 03 to 07  however no current was generated from photons in the near-ir region
