interface modulation spectroscopy doping amorphous silicon solar cells we have developed an interface-modulation spectroscopy that probes the optical spectra of dopants and defects at interface regions a few nanometers wide in semiconductor devices such as p-i-n diodes the method involves detecting the modulation of the optical transmittance or reflectance of diodes due to modulation of the electrical space-charge accumulated near these interfaces we have applied the method to diodes based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-sih the samples that we obtained varied widely in their doped n-type and p-type layersthe results are far more complex than expected in the context of the standard doping model for a-sih due to street in this standard model only a small fraction of dopant atoms incorporated into a-sih are electronic donors or acceptors and such donors and acceptors are created in conjunction with compensating densities of dangling bond defects this standard model predicts that the modulation spectra should be negative and nearly featureless for a broad range of optical energies less than the semiconductor bandgap about l75 ev for a-sih and we do observe such spectra in several samples in addition we found an interesting sharp 0l ev wide positive spectral line near 08 ev which we believe is due to an internal optical transition of a dopant-defect complex incorporating a fourfold coordinated phosphorus and a dangling bond for one series of samples with varying phosphorus-doping levels this line was absent for doping levels below 05 and was nearly fully developed for levels greater than 10 this line was absent for other series of samples prepared by the same laboratory under somewhat different deposition conditions these measurements suggest the possibility of a phase transition in the structure of phosphorus-doped a-sih for sufficiently large phosphorus concentrations
