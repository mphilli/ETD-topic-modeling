exercise effects lipid content intramyocellular lipids obesity exercise science purpose  this study examined the effects of age on intramyocellular imcl stores in response to an acute exercise bout as well as the effects of obesity in older women methods twenty-seven women participated in this study 9 younger obese 18-35 yr bmi30 kgm  2   9 older obese 55-70 yr and 9 older non-obese bmi25kgm  2   after controlling for diet and assessing muscle strength the imcl content in the right gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles were quantified by localized proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  1  h-mrs pre and post a resistance exercise bout fasting blood samples were also drawn and analyzed for glucose and lipid concentrations results  the older obese women had higher pre-exercise fasting soleus imcl content compared to the younger obese women 146017mmol vs 091016mmol p005 but there were no differences in baseline gastrocnemius imcl content between the groups further there were no baseline differences between the older obese and lean women the imcl content was not altered with the exercise session in any of the groups conclusion  although imcl levels in young non-obese men have been shown to decrease with similar exercise stimuli as the present study the imcl content in these obese and older women did not change suggesting that obesity and age significantly affect the plasticity of the imcl pools to resistance exercisescience education purpose  this project aimed to identify sex knowledge differences between freshmen and senior undergraduates   methods  the acquisition of sexual information test was taken anonymously online and covered the four areas of human sexuality  results  the freshmen n52 and senior n40 groups were similar in gender ethnicity college attended within the university and kind of sex ed received in high school overall the senior students scored significantly higher p001 on the test compared to the freshman more specifically the seniors scored significantly higher in the sections on birth control sexual relations and reproduction  p005 and in  male biological aspects of sexuality  p005  conclusion  these data suggest that the seniors may have learned more about sexuality during their time at the university thus helping to bridge the assumed knowledge gap from high school
