thermally responsive polymers self-healing shape memory polymers reversible adhesion responsive polymers are smart materials that are capable of performing prescribed dynamic functions under an applied stimulus in this dissertation we explore several novel design strategies to develop thermally responsive polymers and polymer composites for self-healing reversible adhesion and shape memory applicationsin the first case described in chapters 2 and 3 a thermally triggered self-healing material was prepared by blending a high-temperature epoxy resin with a thermoplastic polymer poly[varepsilon]-caprolactone pcl the initially miscible system undergoes polymerization induced phase separation pips during the curing of epoxy and yields a variety of compositionally dependent morphologies at a particular pcl loading the cured blend displays a bricks-and-mortar morphology in which epoxy exists as interconnected spheres bricks within a continuous pcl matrix mortar a heat induced bleeding phenomenon was observed in the form of spontaneous wetting of all free surfaces by the molten pcl and is attributed to the volumetric thermal expansion of pcl above its melting point in excess of epoxy brick expansion which we term differential expansive bleeding deb this deb is capable of healing damage such as cracks in controlled self-healing experiments heating of a cracked specimen led to pcl bleeding from the bulk that yields a liquid layer bridging the crack gap upon cooling a scar composed of pcl crystals was formed at the site of the crack restoring a significant portion of mechanical strength we further utilized deb to enable strong and thermally-reversible adhesion of the material to itself and to metallic substrates without any requirement for macroscopic softening or flowafter that chapters 4-6 present a novel composite strategy for the design and fabrication of shape memory polymer composites the basic approach involves physically combining two or more functional components into an interpenetrating fibermatrix structure allowing them to function in a synergistic fashion yet remain physically separated this latter aspect is critical since it enables the control of overall composite properties and functions by separately tuning each component utilizing the intrinsic versatility of this approach composites with novel properties and functions in addition to regular shape memory have been developed including 1 shape memory elastomeric composites smecs chapter 4 2 triple-shape polymeric composites tspcs chapter 5 and 3 electrically conductive nanocomposites chapter 6then in chapter 7 by combining the success in both thermoplastic based self-healing and shape memory polymer composites we demonstrate a thermally triggered self-healing coating this coating features a unique shape memory assisted self-healing mechanism in which crack closure via shape memory and crack re-bonding via melting and diffusion of the thermoplastic healing agent are achieved simultaneously upon a single heating step leading to both structural and functional corrosion resistance recoveryfinally chapter 8 presents for the first time the preparation of functionally graded shape memory polymers smps that unlike conventional smps have a range of glass transition temperatures that are spatially graded this was achieved using a temperature gradient curing method that imposes different vitrification limits at different positions along the gradient the resulting material is capable of responding to a wide range of thermal triggers and a good candidate for low-cost material based temperature sensorsall the aforementioned materials and methods show great potential for practical applications due to their high performance low cost and broad applicability some recommendations for future research and development are given in chapter 9
