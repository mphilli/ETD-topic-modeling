 lake ontario embayments were studied in a national science foundation nsf biocomplexity project to understand factors controlling the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems associated with lake ontario  eight embayments of lake ontario and associated watersheds were selected to examine how the linkages between upland watersheds and lake ontario control the inputs and function of interconnected open freshwater embayments ecosystems in this study water samples were collected monthly from the eight lake ontario embayments and 22 tributary sites in the associated sub-watersheds and lake ontario supporting hydrologic measurements were also made over the period 2001-2003 these data were used to examine water quality patterns in the upland tributaries and embayments samples were analyzed for nutrients and major solutesthe land cover of the sub-watersheds was varied but largely a mixture of forest and agricultural lands  tributaries draining largely agricultural lands exhibited distinct seasonal patterns particularly for nutrients  nitrate and total nitrogen tn concentrations were generally low during the summer growing season concentrations increased markedly during fall and decreased during winter and spring total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc and major ion na k ca2 mg2 cl- so42- concentrations varied with seasonal discharge patternsdistinct spatial patterns in tributary solute concentrations were observed that closely corresponded with land use  solute concentrations increased markedly with increases in the percentage of the watershed occurring as agricultural land  such a pattern has been commonly observed for nutrients eg tp tn no3-  doc but this relationship was also strongly evident for many non-nutrient solutes eg f- so42-  these observations suggest that agricultural activities mobilize most elements and greatly enhance transport across the temperate landscape impacting surface water resourcesthe coastal embayments of lake ontario obtain their water from upland watershed drainage direct precipitation and mixing with lake ontario a 3-end member mixing analysis was applied using fluoride as the conservative solute to study the mixing patterns for the embayment ecosystems results indicated that more than 60 of waters were derived from the adjacent watershed in most embayments annually however more than 90 of water in little sodus was derived from lake ontario direct precipitation contributed about 10 in some embayments with large surface area water residence times were calculated in a range between less than 1 day in floodwood to 148 days for south sandy pond using the 3-end member mixing model seasonal variations in the source of water to lake ontario embayments were observed with watershed discharge dominating in spring and lake ontario inputs increasing during the low flow summer period  significant contributions from direct precipitation occurred in late summer and early fall coinciding with low watershed inputsthe embayment ecosystems receive nutrient inputs from upland watersheds and water exchange with lake ontario and undergo biogeochemical processes through internal nutrient cycles simultaneously  regression analyses suggested that upland watersheds played important roles in tn and doc dynamics in the study embayments a positive correlation between tp and density of residences adjacent to the embayments may reflect the release of tp from lawn or garden fertilizers and septic tanks contributing to tp input to embayments mass balance calculations suggested that internal processes within embayments play important roles for some nutrient dynamics for example study embayments acted as sinks for dissolved silica and nitrate but a source for ammoniumwatershed runoff and inflow from lake ontario transported acid neutralizing capacity anc into embayment ecosystems mass balance models for dissolved inorganic carbon anc and particulate carbon were developed to improve understanding of the carbon cycle in the linked freshwater ecosystems regression analysis indicated that watersheds with considerable agricultural land use were large sources of anc in stream discharge and internal biogeochemical processes contributed to changes in anc in the embayments with longer water residence times both mineral saturation index and mass balance calculations indicated the potential for caco3 precipitation suggesting that embayment ecosystems could be terrestrial sinks of inorganic carbon also retention of so42- and no3- can contribute to production of anc within embayments
