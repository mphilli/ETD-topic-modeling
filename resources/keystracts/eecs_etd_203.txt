frequency variational signaling signal processing under the gaussian assumption maximization of the target signal-to-clutter ratio maximizes the probability of detection in a dual polarized radar system this can be achieved through polarimetric processing of the target and clutter backscatter returns in addition to polarization diversity frequency variational signaling may be used to improve detection performance for slowly andor tangentially moving weak targets which typically go undetected when only doppler processing is used previous work in polarization processing predominantly focuses upon optimum single band sb polarimetric radar processing and upon analysis of performance bounds in this dissertation the optimum and adaptive detection performances of frequency variational polarimetric radar processing are investigated two frequency variational signaling schemes are studied namely the multiband mb and ultra-wideband uwb schemes the main objective of this dissertation is to identify optimaladaptive polarimetric processing techniques for mb and uwb waveform target returns to reduce these techniques to practice resulting in signal processing algorithms and to evaluate their detection performance under comparable conditions system requirements and signaling methods for obtaining the mb and uwb polarimetric data returns are discussed implementation and performance analysis of these techniques are studied in detail the performance improvement due to the utilization of frequency variational signaling is obtained from a closed-form expression for detection probability p\sbd derived in this dissertationthe performance improvements obtained using mb frequency variational signaling in conjunction with adaptive polarization processing are evaluated theoretically and demonstrated experimentally using measured data as such performance evaluation of the adaptive multiband polarization canceler ambpc spans from analytic development to experimental demonstration these performance improvements motivate the investigation of optimum uwb polarimetric processing in this dissertationin addition a method for ground target detection based upon polarimetric scene change detection is examined this technique called the polarization discontinuity detector pdd is analyzed and an adaptive pdd with an embedded constant false alarm rate cfar feature is developed
