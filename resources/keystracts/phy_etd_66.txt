vortex matter superconductors hydrodynamic fields non-gaussian hydrodynamic free energy bosons the main part of this thesis deals with the hydrodynamic description of the long wavelength properties of vortex liquids in extreme type-ii superconductors the underlying theoretical background at the more fundamental level is that of the london approximation starting from the formal analogy between directed flux-lines and lines of time evolution of non-relativistic charged bosons proposed by feigel'man and collaborators some time ago we derive a non-gaussian hydrodynamic free energy which is a functional of coarse-grained hydrodynamic fields this description fully takes into account the nonlocality of the intervortex interaction in the applied field direction an important property of the flux-line liquid which characterizes the correlation of the lines along the applied field direction is the tilt modulus we use lowest order perturbation theory in the non-gaussian free energy to calculate the interaction-induced upward renormalization of the tilt modulus in a clean infinitely thick vortex liquid we extend this calculation to perturbatively calculate the disorder-induced renormalization of the tilt modulus for vortex liquids in the presence of weak disorder of various geometries after discussing some inherent flaws of the directed flux-line models we propose a new hydrodynamics of a liquid of arbitrarily curved flux-lines and vortex loops we derive this new model from a relativistic boson analogythe last chapter is somewhat independent from the rest of the thesis its subject is the onset of plasticity in driven vortex lattices away from equilibrium we particularly study the results of a recent experiment carried out by the argonne group and collaborators in the corbino disk geometry we describe the onset of plasticity as the proliferation of free dislocations breaking away from bound pairs our analysis of the thermal effects closely follows the stress relaxation theory of bruinsma halperin and zippelius for two-dimensional crystals
