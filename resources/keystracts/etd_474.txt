aids performance queer archives southern culture temporality this project is a rumination on the rhetorical stylistics of queer men who performed southern culture in new york city during the first and second waves of the american hivaids crisis 1982-1992 i examine the transplant archive a self-compiled assemblage of archival fragments representing the lives of three unrelated american southern transplants who lived in nyc and were in some way affected by the emergence of hivaids methodologically i bend the boundary between archival and critical ethnographic research by placing myself  my own sensory experience and positionality  within the archive i argue that collectively these texts create cultural memories of aids via a stylization of southernness which illuminates the performative potential of doing southern culture as a way of discombobulating the predominant logics of futurity and resisting the effects of a heteronormative linear temporal order brought about by the larger united states public sphere i infer that each of the figures i analyze illustrates a southern style that productively functions as a backward temporal regression simultaneously a backwardness in time and a backwardness that culturally functions as a signifier of southernness more specifically i insist that through their southern performances each featured transplant rhetorically constructs their own temporality against the ominous risk of hivaids
