welfare pan-arab arab free trade areas trade integration this research provides a comprehensive analysis of arab countries barriers to intra-regional imports in view of the pan-arab free trade area pafta liberalization initiative it assesses welfare gains and losses terms of trade benefits to domestic producers the impact on tariff revenues and thus the net impact on pafta members' economiesdue to data limitations only seven arab countries are analyzed algeria egypt kuwait morocco oman saudi arabia and tunisia in sharp contrast with expectations this research shows a loss of 459m in net welfare for pafta because overall gains are 622m and losses are 1081manalysis of trade integration is performed on a sector-by-sector basis to identify the industries that have the largest impact on members' welfare the analysis uses sitc 4-digit bilateral trade data and a partial equilibrium approach to estimate three types of elasticities at sitc 2-digit level common elasticity estimate is -11 for intra-regional imports 059 for interregional exports and -069 for the elasticity of substitution between intra-regional imports and inter-regional imports from the world estimated elasticities vary widely across sectorsimports projections suggest the pafta's trade-diverting impact of 3344m is substantially greater than its trade creating effects of 375m which respectively constitute a decrease of 34 in inter-regional imports and an increase of 32 in intra-regional importsnet welfare from pafta is negative the reason is that the impact on imports is larger for trade diversion than that for trade creation also a member country pays a hefty loss in tariff revenue on all existing intra-regional imports whereas it loses tariff revenue on only the diverted imports however only four comparative advantage sectors are industries that exhibit economies of scale organic and inorganic chemicals fertilizers and plastics as such few industries could exploit the improved market access provided by pafta
