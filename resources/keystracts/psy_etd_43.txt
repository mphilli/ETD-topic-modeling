age-related executive control verbal memory visuospatial memory working memory repetition detection the current study explores executive control processes of working memory in order to attempt to identify the factor underlying age-related differences a new and unique paradigm repetition detection is manipulated to create four processing conditions baseline transformation supervision and coordination examined in analogous verbal and visuo-spatial domains the baseline condition requires the participant to find a repeat in a series of stimuli the transformation condition requires on-line transformation and updating of stimuli in addition to the baseline task the supervision condition requires a repeat to be located in two distinct channels or processing streams the coordination condition requires simultaneous access in order to find a repeat across channels the results from three experiments suggest age-insensitivity for the baseline and transformation conditions but age-sensitivity for the supervision and coordination conditions experiment 3 suggests that the age-related differences in working memory are specific to the process of focus switching a condition requiring the maintenance of distinct processing streams the findings provide support for a process-specific account of age-related differences in executive control as well as for the fractionalization of working memory
