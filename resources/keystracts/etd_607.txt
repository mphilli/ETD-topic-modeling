achievement biology pltl retention stem urm increasing underrepresented minority urm participation in science technology engineering and mathematics stem is of increasing national importance as the united states continues to fall behind other nations in global economic competitiveness these students constitute a large pool of potential stem majors at the college level but they have been recruited to and retained in stem programs at significantly lower rates than students from other populations as such president barack obamas presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast has called on undergraduate science instructors to diversify their teaching methods and employ active learning strategies to improve students success in introductory or gatekeeper courses as well as improving students attitudes toward stem as a strategy that fosters active learning peer-led team learning pltl holds the potential to provide much of what pcast deems necessary to improve urm student performance in introductory courses and retention in stem majors in the first of two studies presented herein we found the pltl model to be effective in improving scores for both urm and non-urm students in an introductory college science course in the second study we found pltl to be associated with higher levels of retention among urm students we conclude that participation in pltl can help urm students who may struggle to identify with stem to develop stronger stem identities which along with higher achievement may lead to enhanced retention
