ad hoc networking adult learning healthcare military telemedicine wireless grids while telemedicine and technology-enabled education are not new concepts and have significant bodies of research in depth application to management and treatment of veteran post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd and traumatic brain injury tbi is relatively new  the conflicts in the southwest asia over the last two decades have significantly increased the need for healthcare and support services for these returning warriors  creative thinking and innovative technologies are needed to meet the growing and changing demand of these patients in the face of many competing demands within the us healthcare sectorthis doctoral research study investigated the potential for a platform-agnostic ad hoc networking technology to serve as a trusted social networking and training platform for healthcare providers who are striving to provide quality healthcare that meets the needs of veterans suffering from ptsd and tbi  this research study analyzed the effectiveness of a digitally networked environment to deliver desired training and certification outcomes in a military healthcare environment  the level of acceptance of an ad hoc network technology gridstreamrx by healthcare professionals using it as an enabler of collaboration during the training process was evaluated  the results also assessed the readiness of healthcare professionals to use this information communications technology ict or analogous new applications and services to help them perform their healthcare responsibilitiesthis thesis study accomplished with the support of the us army and national science foundation took place at two large military medical centers over a twelve-month period of time  data was gathered from 568 healthcare professionals using quantitative survey instruments  ninety-six respondents provided additional quantitative and qualitative inputs at various times during a proscribed training regimen  delone and mclean's 2003 information system success model modified by findings of more recent research provided the theoretical lens for analyzing the data from 32 of the training participants in determining the perceived net benefit of the gridstreamrx technologythe data gathered for the study showed at the 95 level of confidence that a majority of the professionals of these two medical centers would perceive a positive net benefit from using gridstreamrx in a healthcare training environment  the conclusion from this analysis was that not only are the healthcare providers in this study ready to use ict and social networking in this professional setting but also that gridstreamrx is an acceptable platform for performing these functionsthe study participants provided input with respect to their priorities regarding information sharing techniques functionality and suggestions for improving the platform  the outcomes confirmed that gridstreamrx can be a successful introduction of ad hoc networking to telemedicine  this thesis concluded with recommendations for scholars and practitioners to pursue in the future and should be followed up with further research and actions in order to build toward a fully integrated virtual healthcare environment fivhe
