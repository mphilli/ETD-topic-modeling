self-reported alcohol use persons with psychiatric disorders are at increased risk for experiencing the negative consequences of problematic drinking behavior assessment of alcohol abuse in this population is therefore crucial self-report based instruments are flexible inexpensive as well as easily administered and can be used in mental health settings to assess alcohol abuse among psychiatric patients however the psychometrics of these instruments have not been well investigated with psychiatric populations specifically very little is known about the temporal stability of self-report-based measures in psychiatric settings further the potential for clinical respondent characteristics to influence the performance of such measures has not been addressed the present study addressed two primary goals a determination of test-retest reliability of three self-report based alcohol assessments and b ability of clinical respondent factors ie memory and psychiatric symptomatology to predict consistency in responses from time 1 to time 2 in an outpatient mental health setting participants were 71 persons all with axis i diagnoses who were receiving outpatient psychiatric care from a local state psychiatric facility test-retest reliability coefficients indicated that responses to these self-report based measures were highly reliable over time memory performance and psychiatric symptomatology did not interfere with temporal stability of responses in this sample however other respondent characteristics such as gender age and history of alcohol-use disorder were found to be associated with consistency of self-reports of alcohol use and related consequences over time these results are summarized and integrated with respect to existing literature implications for clinicians and researchers are discussed followed by suggestions for future research
