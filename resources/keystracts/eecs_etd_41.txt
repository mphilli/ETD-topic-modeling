fading channels decentralized detection resource-constrained wireless sensor networks wireless sensor networks wsn are envisioned to encompass wide applications ranging from battlefield surveillance health care and telemedicine to environmental and habitat monitoring and control technical challenges however must be addressed to make the vision come true for instance stringent resource constraints and unreliable wireless transmission medium make the traditional signal processing techniques not applicable to the emerging wsn domainin this dissertation we investigate several important problems in the area of signal processing for resource constrained wsn systems specifically we study optimal decentralized detection schemes under non-ideal communication channels and energy and bandwidth constraints we first develop optimal fusion strategies for decentralized detection in multi-hop wsn we begin with formulating the multi-hop detection and fusion structure for rayleigh fading channels given the fusion structure we then propose the likelihood ratio lr based optimal fusion rule and several alternative suboptimal fusion rules that are easier to implement with less complexityfurthermore we address the problem of robust local quantizer design for decentralized detection under transmission losses due to channel outage or sensor failure considering binary local decisions we propose two design schemes where the first does not require explicit channel information while the latter approach is essentially a channel-aware design we show that for both cases the optimal local decision rules lead to a likelihood ratio test lrt at local sensors the proposed designs protect the system detection performance from severe degradation in events of channel breakdowns or sensor node failuresfinally to accommodate the bandwidth constraint of the wsn we study the decision rules for decentralized detection over multiple access channels in particular we establish that the optimal local decision rules at local sensors again amount to the lrt for both synchronized and asynchronous cases for asynchronous sensor transmissions we propose a fusion structure that consists of a rake receiver with square-law detector this receiver structure enables the implementation of the optimal local decision rule and the fusion rule and compensates for the unknown delays and channel fading coefficients
