ester bonds peptide bonds the synthesis of the cyclic ligands containing the amide linkage will be discussed in the following sections of this work hydrolysis of the amide linkage plays a great role in the biological systems  although a large number of metal  complexes containing the amide linkage  where studied and fully characterized cyclic compounds containing this linkage have not been explored
