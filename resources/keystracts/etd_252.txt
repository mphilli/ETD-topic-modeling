 interference is an important issue for wireless communication systems where multipleuncoordinated users try to access to a common medium the problem is even morecrucial for next-generation cellular networks where frequency reuse becomes ever moreintense leading to more closely placed co-channel cells this thesis describes our attempt to understand the impact of interference on communication performance as well as optimal ways to handle interference from the theoretical point of view we examine how interference affects the fundamental performance limits and provide insights on how interference should be treated for various channel models under different operatingconditions from the practical design point of view we provide solutions to improve thesystem performance under unknown interference using multiple independent receptionsof the same informationfor the simple two-user gaussian interference channel we establish that the simplefrequency division multiplexing fdm technique suffices to provide the optimal sum-rate within the largest computable subregion of the general achievable rate region for acertain interference rangefor the two-user discrete memoryless interference channels we characterize differentinterference regimes as well as the corresponding capacity results they include one-sided weak interference and mixed interference conditions the sum-rate capacities arederived in both cases the conditions capacity expressions as well as the capacity achieving schemes are analogous to those of the gaussian channel model the studyalso leads to new outer bounds that can be used to resolve the capacities of several newdiscrete memoryless interference channelsa three-user interference up-link transmission model is introduced by examining howinterference affects the behavior of the performance limits we capture the differencesand similarities between the traditional two-user channel model and the channel modelwith more than two users if the interference is very strong the capacity region is justa simple extension of the two-user case for the strong interference case a line segmenton the boundary of the capacity region is attained when there are links with weakinterference the performance limits behave very differently from that of the two-usercase there is no single case that is found of which treating interference as noise isoptimal in particular for a subclass of gaussian channels with mixed interference aboundary point of the capacity region is determined for the gaussian channel withweak interference sum capacities are obtained under various channel coefficients andpower constraint conditions the optimalities in all the cases are obtained by decodingpart of the interferencefinally we investigate a topic that has practical ramifications in real communicationsystems we consider in particular a diversity reception system where independentlycopies of low density parity check ldpc coded signals are received relying only onnon-coherent reception in a highly dynamic environment with unknown interference soft-decision combining is achieved whose performance is shown to improve significantly over existing approaches that rely on hard decision combining
