tau lepton pseudoscalar decay constant d meson phi meson charm quark in this thesis we present a new determination of [special characters omitted] using 5 million [special characters omitted] events obtained with the cleo ii detector at the cornell electron storage ring cesr our value is derived from our new measured ratio [special characters omitted]  using [special characters omitted]  we extract [special characters omitted] mev we compare this result with various model calculations
