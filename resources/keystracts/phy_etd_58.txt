b mesons upsilon4s resonance charged mesons neutral mesons production ratio we analyze 97  10 6 bb pairs recorded with the cleo detector to determine the production ratio of charged to neutral b mesons produced at the [special characters omitted] 4s resonance we measure the exclusive rates for b 0 [arrow right] j [special characters omitted] k [low ]0 and b  [arrow right] j [special characters omitted] k [low ] decays and employ the world-average b -meson lifetime ratio to extract the relative width [special characters omitted] with the assumption that f -  f 00  1 we obtain [special characters omitted] this production ratio and its uncertainty apply to all exclusive b branching fractions measured at the upsilon4s resonance peak
