hopf algebras drinfeld double semisimple let h  be a cosemisimple hopf algebra over an algebraically closed field in the first chapter of the thesis it is shown that if  h  has a simple subcoalgebra of dimension 9 and has no simple subcoalgebras of even dimension then h  contains either a grouplike element of order 2 or 3 or a family of simple subcoalgebras whose dimensions are the squares of each positive odd integer in particular if h  is odd dimensional then its dimension is divisible by 3in the second chapter the induced representations from h and h  to the drinfel'd double d  h  are studied the product of two such representations is a sum of copies of the regular representation of d  h  the action of certain irreducible central characters of h  on the simple modules of h is considered the modules that receive trivial action from each such irreducible central character are precisely the constituents of the tensor powers of the adjoint representation of h
