computer vision human visual system image processing medical imaging performance limits stochastic resonance noise this dissertation investigates the problem of image processing  based on stochastic resonance sr noise and human visual system hvs  properties where several novel frameworks and algorithms for object detection  in images image enhancement and image segmentation as well as the method to  estimate the performance limit of image segmentation algorithms are developedobject detection in images is a fundamental problem whose goal is  to make a decision if the object of interest is present or absent in a given  image we develop a framework and algorithm to enhance the detection performance  of suboptimal detectors using sr noise where we add a suitable dose of noise  into the original image data and obtain the performance improvement  micro-calcification detection is employed in this dissertation as an  illustrative example the comparative experiments with a large number of images  verify the efficiency of the presented approachimage enhancement plays an important role and is widely used in  various vision tasks we develop two image enhancement approaches one is based  on sr noise hvs-driven image quality evaluation metrics and the constrained  multi-objective optimization moo technique which aims at refining the  existing suboptimal image enhancement methods another is based on the selective  enhancement framework under which we develop several image enhancement  algorithms the two approaches are applied to many low quality images and they  outperform many existing enhancement algorithmsimage segmentation is critical to image analysis we present two  segmentation algorithms driven by hvs properties where we incorporate the human  visual perception factors into the segmentation procedure and encode the prior  expectation on the segmentation results into the objective functions through  markov random fields mrf our experimental results show that the presented  algorithms achieve higher segmentation accuracy than many representative  segmentation and clustering algorithms available in the literatureperformance limit or performance bound is very useful to  evaluate different image segmentation algorithms and to analyze the  segmentability of the given image content we formulate image segmentation as a  parameter estimation problem and derive a lower bound on the segmentation error  ie the mean square error mse of the pixel labels considered in our work  using a modified cramr-rao bound crb the derivation is based on the biased  estimator assumption whose reasonability is verified in this dissertation  experimental results demonstrate the validity of the derived bound
