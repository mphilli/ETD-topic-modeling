detection heavy-tailed signals hypothesis testing inference information fusion statistical dependence the detection of spatially dependent heavy-tailed signals is considered in this dissertation  while the central limit theorem and its implication of asymptotic normality of interacting random processes is generally useful for the theoretical characterization of a wide variety of natural and man-made signals sensor data from many different applications in fact are characterized by  non-gaussian distributions a common characteristic observed in non-gaussian data is the presence of heavy-tails or fat tails for such data the probability density function pdf of extreme values decay at a slower-than-exponential rate implying that extreme events occur with greater probability when these events are observed simultaneously by several sensors their observations are also spatially dependent in this dissertation we develop the theory of detection for such data obtained through heterogeneous sensors in order to validate our theoretical results and proposed algorithms we collect and analyze the behavior of indoor footstep data using a linear array of seismic sensors we characterize the inter-sensor dependence using copula theory copulas are parametric functions which bind univariate pdf s to generate a valid joint pdfwe model the heavy-tailed data using the class of alpha-stable distributions we consider a two-sided test in the neyman-pearson framework and present an asymptotic analysis of the generalized likelihood test glrt both nested and non-nested models are considered in the analysis we also use a likelihood maximization-based copula selection scheme as an integral part of the detection process since many types of copula functions are available in the literature selecting the appropriate copula becomes an important component of the detection problem the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated numerically on simulated data as well as using indoor seismic data with appropriately selected models our results demonstrate that a high probability of detection can be achieved for false alarm probabilities of the order of  10^-4these results using dependent alpha-stable signals are presented for a two-sensor case we identify the computational challenges associated with dependent alpha-stable modeling and propose alternative schemes to extend the detector design to a multisensor multivariate setting we use a hierarchical tree based approach called vines to model the multivariate copulas ie model the spatial dependence between multiple sensors the performance of the proposed detectors under the vine-based scheme are evaluated on the indoor footstep data and significant improvement is observed when compared against the case when only two sensors are deployed some open research issues are identified and discussed
