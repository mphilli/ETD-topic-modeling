 nanoparticle np self-assembly has been proven as an effective route to organize nanoscale building blocks into ordered structures for potential technological applications in order to successfully exploit the self-assembly processes a high level of direction and control is required in my dissertation research i synthesized a temperature responsive copolymer p to modify gold nanoparticles aunp for controlling self-assembly the copolymers' ability to regulate dna-mediated np self-assembly is a particular focus in chapter 2 the results show that by the addition of the p to create thermally responsive np interfaces allows for controlled aggregation behavior and interparticle distances defined by the transition temperature tc of the p to aid in np assembly and help to regulate dna-mediated interactions between np the work in chapter 3 revealed that the reconfigurable conformation of the p sterically regulates the assembly at t  tc the chains extended beyond the hydrodynamic reach of the single stranded dna and prohibited recognition while at t  tc assembly was observed due the hydrophobic collapse of the p and the subsequent exposure of the complementary dna bases in chapter 4 to gain insight into the mechanism the rate of assembly was monitored with dna lengths that had hydrodynamic diameters more comparable to that of the p and found the p was capable of slowing the kinetics i further investigated to find that the addition of p extended the interparticle distances while disrupting the long range ordering finally how the temperature responsive behavior of the p acted on the interparticle distances was probed and it was found that without p the interparticle distances expanded while the addition of p compressed the interparticle distances
