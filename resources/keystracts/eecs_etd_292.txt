access control hol theorem prover user assignments role inheritance the access-control logic of lampson abadi and their colleagues [labw92 ablp93] makes it possible to assure the correctness of access-control decisions by accounting correctly for identity credentials authority delegation and privileges it can be used to describe a variety of access-control policies and to reason about their access-control decisions however it lacks an ability to reason about role-based access control rbac [fsg   01 fbk99 fkc03 scfy96] which is a popular technique for reducing the administrative complexity of associating users and privileges this dissertation introduces extensions to the access-control logic that can be used to assure the correctness of rbac access-control decisions by implementing and extending the access-control logic in a computer-assisted reasoning tool such as the higher order logic hol theorem prover [gm93] the access-control logic and its extensions are proved to be sound the result is a tool for design and verification engineers to reason about access-control policies including rbacin this dissertation we explain how to use the logic to describe rbac components such as user assignments permission assignments role inheritance role activations and users' requests we also describe in detail the steps of implementing the access-control logic and its extensions in the hol theorem prover administrative rbac systems are also explored to see how the hol theorem prover can be used to formally verify their properties and policies
