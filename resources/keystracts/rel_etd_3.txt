benedictus de spinoza politics religion secularism philosophy bible this dissertation argues that baruch de spinoza's conception of god plays a decisive and often unappreciated role in his conceptions of politics and religion while spinoza is often interpreted as an early secular or liberal thinker this work argues that such interpretations neglect the senses of order and authority that are at the heart of spinoza's idea of god for spinoza god is an organized and directed totality of all that exists moreover for spinoza god is entirely immanent to this totality to such an extent that all things are fundamentally of god when we fully appreciate the extent to which god permeates and orders every aspect of our reality the full sense of spinoza's theories of tolerance and the social contract come into view for rather than assuming that the human beings involved in political relationships are independent autonomous individuals we can see that for spinoza they are parts of a larger whole who are subject to distinct natural laws spinoza maintains that such laws manifest themselves equally and identically in the seemingly distinct realms of religion and politics in this respect then spinoza's theories of religion and biblical interpretation are not properly secular in character but rather blur the standard boundary between the religious and the political as they try to recognize and codify the inviolable laws of nature--or god
