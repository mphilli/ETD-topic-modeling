convergence spaces specification logic discrete systems continuous systems in contrast to what we know about controlling verifying and reasoning about discrete state transition systems and separately continuous dynamical systems we know relatively little about the behavior of even simple hybrid systems systems consisting of interdependent discrete eg digital and continuous eg analog components logic-based formal techniques are available for discrete systems that enable us to rigorously reason about their evolution over sequences of discrete time some of these logics eg s4 have been reinterpreted to act on dynamical systems evolving on continuous time however the modeling of hybrid systems has lacked a unified framework that treats both discrete and continuous components of a state in fundamentally the same way we present a logic for the evolution of hybrid systems in which the notion of time can be discrete continuous hybrid or even none of the above the new logic includes as special cases the logics available for discrete and continuous systems
