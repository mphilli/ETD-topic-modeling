mathematics teaching undergraduate visualization it has been documented that students learn mathematics in different ways and through different learning styles in particular it has been found that some students prefer to understand and learn mathematics visually other researchers have determined that visual methods may be used by problem solvers in mathematics even in solutions that are deemed non-visual thus the visual context appears to play a significant role in learning mathematics but are instructors of mathematics aware of and responsive towards these needs it is this question that i attempted to address in this study more precisely in this study i examined the use of visual strategies in the teaching of mathematicsmy intention was to study the use of such strategies from the instructors' perspective thus i selected five instructors in the mathematics department of a university who were teaching different courses in calculus i observed several classes that they taught during one semester of the course and conducted interviews with them in order to understand their perceptions of teaching and mathematics we also discussed several other issues related to teaching such as assessment and the role of visualization in teaching and learning mathematics these observations and interviews delineated for me the teaching approaches of these instructors and more specifically how they used visual strategies in order to solve problems of instruction an examination of the assessment tools used by the instructors with regard to the visual strategies used therein completed my examination of the instructors' individual case studiesi identified four primary visual teaching strategies and attempted to categorize the use of each of them for each instructor my findings from this study indicated that while instructors used a wide range of visual instructional strategies frequently blending several of them in one teaching episode they often downplayed the role of such strategies in their classrooms based on the study and the research in other similar areas i made several suggestions for teaching and research in mathematics education
