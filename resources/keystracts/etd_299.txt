emergency response geospatial technology human cognitive stigmergy mass collaboration social media information and communications technologies icts particularly social media and geographic information systems gis have become a transformational force in emergency response social media enables ad hoc collaboration providing timely useful information dissemination and sharing and helping to overcome limitations of time and place geographic information systems increase the level of situation awareness serving geospatial data using interactive maps animations and computer generated imagery derived from sophisticated global remote sensing systems digital workspaces bring these technologies together and contribute to meeting ad hoc and formal emergency response challenges through their affordances of situation awareness and mass collaboration distributed icts that enable ad hoc emergency response via digital workspaces have arguably made traditional top-down system deployments less relevant in certain situations including emergency response merrill 2009 heylighen 2007a b heylighen 2014 2007a b theorizes that human cognitive stigmergy explains some self-organizing characteristics of ad hoc systems elliott 2007 identifies cognitive stigmergy as a factor in mass collaborations supported by digital workspaces stigmergy a term from biology refers to the phenomenon of self-organizing systems with agents that coordinate via perceived changes in the environment rather than direct communication in the present research ad hoc emergency response is examined through the lens of human cognitive stigmergy the basic assertion is that icts and stigmergy together make possible highly effective ad hoc collaborations in circumstances where more typical collaborative methods break down the research is organized into three essays an in-depth analysis of the development and deployment of the ushahidi emergency response software platform a comparison of the emergency response icts used for emergency response during hurricanes katrina and sandy and a process model developed from the case studies and relevant academic literature is described
