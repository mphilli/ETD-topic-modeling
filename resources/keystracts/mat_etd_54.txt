boundedness bounded sequence salem test the focus of this investigation is pointwise convergence of fourier series of functions defined on a compact vilenkin group ie a compact metrizable totally disconnected abelian group throughout we assume that the vilenkin group satisfies a certain boundedness condition namely that a sequence of primes determined by the structure of the group is a bounded sequencewe begin with an examination of the salem test for uniform convergence of fourier series we provide a new proof of an adaptation of the salem test to fourier series on vilenkin groups due to c w onneweer and daniel watermannext we localize the salem test to obtain a test for pointwise convergence of the fourier series of f here it is shown that the assumption of continuity of f at x which was required in the proof of uniform convergence may be weakened to the existence of a suitably defined derivative of the integral of fx-t this localized salem test is very closely related to a version of the lebesgue test due to onneweer and watermanapplication of similar methods to the study of functions of harmonic bounded fluctuation yields the result that the fourier series of a function of harmonic bounded fluctuation converges everywhere the function satisfies the differentiability of the integral condition mentioned abovefinally we construct a banach space of functions with everywhere-convergent fourier series
