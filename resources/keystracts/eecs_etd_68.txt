system design embedded systems reliability soft errors as the technology scales down and the number of circuits grows the issue of soft errors and reliability in system design is set to become an increasingly challenging issue for the industry as a whole this is true for both commercial consumer applications and safety critical real-time applications specifically for high-volume low-margin consumer products frequent soft errors can lead to expensive field maintenance for safety critical applications on the other hand poor reliability can be catastrophic in terms of both human and equipment cost therefore reliability-aware design that targets at mitigating the potential consequences of soft errors and other types of transient errors is highly desirable this thesis is a step in this direction specifically we incorporate the reliability metric into the system level design process for embedded systems focusing on hardwaresoftware co-design flow this thesis proposes several techniques at different levels to improve design reliability we first present a reliability oriented hardwaresoftware co-design framework we then propose two high-level synthesis techniques to improve the design reliability using a characterized library we also incorporate energy consumption of the tasks mapped onto the multiprocessor architectures as softwares along with reliability metric since the memory components are more vulnerable to soft errors we present a novel memory minimization strategy based on recomputation of select tasks finally in this thesis we also study the process mapping onto fpgas field programmable gate arrays to improve the reliability of fpga based designs
