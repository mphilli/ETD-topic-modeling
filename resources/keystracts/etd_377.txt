antibiotic resistance antimicrobial peptides biofilm escherichia coli persister cells pseudomonas aeruginosa the rapid increase in antibiotic resistant infections and the slowing pace of antibiotic development emphasize the need for alternative therapeutic agents to cure infectious diseases especially those caused by multidrug-resistant mdr strains bacteria obtain resistance to antibiotics through multiple mechanisms one of intrinsic mechanisms of drug resistance is persister formation by which bacterial cells enter a metabolically inactive stage and become highly tolerant to essentially all antibiotics even at the concentrations that are hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose required to kill normal planktonic cells of the same strain persister cells in biofilms are even more difficult to kill due to the presence of an extracellular matrix that can block or retard the penetration of antibiotics thus new antimicrobials that are effective against these drug tolerant cells are urgently needed for infection controlin this study we characterized the antimicrobial activities of newly designed synthetic peptides on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains including regular planktonic cells and those in biofilms and at the persister stages our results revealed that 2d-24 an rw-rich dendrimeric peptide can kill planktonic cells of both p aeruginosa pao1 and pdo300 a mucoid strain in a dose-dependent manner killing effect on biofilm and persister cells was observed at the concentrations without significant toxicity to ib3-1 cells originated from human lung tissueswe also demonstrated that tn-5 a 135-triazine derivative has antimicrobial effects on e coli rp437 p aeruginosa pao1 and pdo300 cells with a minimum inhibitory concentration mic of 128 m and kills regular planktonic cells of both species dose dependently tn-5 was also found effective against persister and biofilm cells of both e coli and p aeruginosa and the killing of biofilm cells of the mucoid pdo300 was enhanced by alginate lyaseto understand the effects of amp charge on the killing effects we modified the net charge of calcitermin originated from human airway secretions and tested the effects on e coli and p aeruginosa planktonic and persister cells at different ph values the neutral derivative of calcitermin showed better killing effect on persister cells at ph 74along with synthetic peptides we also studied the membrane potential of persister cells with cell sorting and flow cytometry techniques using potentiometric dyes persister cells showed lower membrane potential along with lower efflux pump activities compared to normal cells based on these findings we tested the hypothesis that persister cells can be effectively killed by antibiotics that are substrates of efflux pumps consistent with this hypothesis erythromycin was found effective in killing persister cells of e coli  while normal cells are resistant to it this higher killing activity of erythromycin was corroborated with higher erythromycin accumulation in persister cells based on the results of mass spectrometry analysis
