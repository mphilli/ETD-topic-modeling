technetium rhenium radiopharmaceutical nuclear medicine this study focuses on the design development and synthesis of technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceutical agents for imaging and therapy in nuclear medicine due to the inherent chemical similarities between technetium and rhenium the non-radioactive rhenium was used as a surrogate for the technetium metal which exists only as radioactive isotopesstudies of the interaction of the metal ions tci iii v and rei iii v with aromatic and aliphatic amines carboxyl groups thiols and thioethers constitutes a significant segment of this work after a careful investigation of the coordination preferences of the metal cores towards the different donor ligand systems a series of single amino acid chelates saac and their complexes were designed and synthesizedthe conjugate pendant approach was implemented in the design of the radiopharmaceuticals the three major components of this strategy the biologically active molecule bam the bifunctional chelator bfca and the radiometal core were explored chapters 2 and 3 focus on the single amino acid chelates as the bfca for conjugation to a small peptide acting as the bam chapter 4 discusses the importance of thiols and thioethers in the development of technetium and rhenium metal complexes with charges ranging from 1 to -1 chapter 5 demonstrates the utility of a series of cationic and ether-based agents as myocardial perfusion agents chapter 6 concentrates on the synthesis of brain imaging agents for the dat 5-htt and net chapter 7 presents the improved and very convenient synthesis and thorough characterization of the [reh 2 o 3 co 3 ]br starting material
