funding rd public administration during the last decade there have been fundamental changes in research and development rd policies and the mechanisms used to implement those policies before 1960 although direct funding mechanisms were prevalent there were only modest tax mechanisms and a minuscule number of cooperative mechanisms interaction between government university and industrial labs was uncommon in the past ten years that situation has changed tremendously policy complexity has replaced relative simplicity but the real impact of these changes has not yet been ascertainedthe mechanisms used for policy intervention with industrial rd can be classified into three groups direct government support mechanisms indirect government support mechanisms and institutional design mechanisms direct mechanisms are grants loans appropriations or government contracts indirect mechanisms are various tax law provisions allowing firms to recoup costs on rd institutional design mechanisms concentrate on the creation of new institutions amenable to higher levels of rd performance a great variety of such institutions exist including research and development limited partnerships joint ventures and multiple forms of government industry and university interactioncurrent policy consists of all three types of government involvement with industrial rd the relative influence of each mechanism is a source of great concern too often the debate focuses only on the desired outcome of policy mechanisms--the policy-push--to the exclusion of the characteristics or environment of the laboratory the--lab-pullwhat best explains the differential utilization of the policy mechanisms by industrial rd laboratories policy-push or lab-pull this study attempts to lend some insights into this question by examining policy-push and lab-pull explanations for policy mechanism utilization to provide the foundation for the empirical portions of the study several chapters deal with the justifications for and evolution of the various policy mechanisms the interaction between internal laboratory structures and policy mechanism utilization is considered using data collected as part of the national comparative research and development project ncrdp an assessment of the overall influence of the policy mechanisms drawing from both the detailed policy discussion and the ncrdp data is given
