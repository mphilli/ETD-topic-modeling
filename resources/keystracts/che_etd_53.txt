aromatic thiol redox buffers disulfide protein folding disulfide-containing proteins are regularly produced for pharmaceutical industrial and academic purposes the yield-limiting and most expensive step in the production of active protein is the formation of the correct disulfide bonds current technology uses aliphatic thiols as redox buffers for folding disulfide-containing proteins aliphatic thiols limit the conditions ph at which the proteins can be folded a group of aqueous soluble aromatic thiols were tested for their ability to improve the folding rate constant of a disulfide-containing protein ribonuclease a rnase a the folding of rnase a was measured at ph 60 70 and 77 using various concentrations of each of the thiols the aromatic thiols increased the folding rate of rnase a by a factor of 4-20 times that measured for glutathione gsh the naturally occurring aliphatic thiol commonly used for folding disulfide-containing proteins it was observed that optimal protein folding conditions correlated to an equal concentration of protonated thiol [sh] rather than total thiol the data for the  para  -substituted aromatic thiols were fit to the model log  k  app   -431 003  0592 0004 ph - 0227 0005 p k  a   log  1-e -098 002 [sh]   the equation gave good regression statistics r 2   0914 s  010 thirteen data points were used as a validation set r 2  validation   094 and s validation   0083 additionally the equation was used to predict the measured values of the apparent rate constant for rnase a folding in the presence of five aqueous soluble ortho  - and meta  -substituted aromatic thiols n  124 r2  080 s  00046 protein disulfide isomerase pdi is a catalyst typically added to redox buffers for folding inclusion bodies of disulfide-containing proteins the para  -substituted aromatic thiols were tested for their ability to increase the activity of pdi activity increased up to three times aromatic thiols are expected to be excellent candidates for increasing the yield of active protein from inclusion bodies of disulfide-containing proteins
