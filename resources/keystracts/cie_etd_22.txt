aquatic ecosystems atmospheric deposition forest ecosystems sulfur an integrated biogeochemical model pnet-bgc which operates on a monthly tine step was formulated to simulate chemical transformations of vegetation soil and drainage water in northern forest ecosystems the validity of the model was tested against soil and stream data at the hubbard brook experimental forest hbef new hampshire predictions of concentrations and fluxes of major elements generally agreed reasonably well with measured values model output of soil base saturation and stream acid neutralizing capacity anc were sensitive to parameter values of soil partial pressure of carbon dioxide co 2  soil mass soil cation exchange capacity cec and soil selectivity coefficients of calcium ca 2  and aluminum al n pnet-bgc simulation of sulfur s dynamics at the hbef using a measured dryto-bulk deposition ratio of 021 resulted in an underprediction of soil s pools and stream sulfate so 4 2-  concentrations and assumption on the additional source of s affects model forecasts of the future response to anticipated decreases in s deposition long-term simulations showed that elevated s deposition has increased stream so 4 2- concentrations and the enhanced incorporation of sin adsorbed so 4 2- and organic s soil pools following the implementation of the 1970 amendment to the clean air act there has been a net release of s from soil poolssimulation results also indicate that atmospheric deposition of both strong acids and basic cations and historical forest cutting practices have resulted in changes in the soil base saturation the stream ph and anc from pre-industrial estimates of 20 63 and 43 eq l -1  respectively to current values of 10 50 and -5 eq l -1  respectively while historical forest cutting and vegetation accumulation had little effect on the long-term depletion of base cations from soil exchange pools model predictions of exchangeable cation pools and stream chemistry were markedly affected by deposition of strong acids and basic cation with the deposition of strong acid anions having the most impactsimulations of previous and anticipated controls on emissions indicate that the extent of recovery of the forest soils and stream waters depends on the degree of the emission controls imposed model predictions suggest that ecological indicators of the sensitivity to soil and water to acid deposition at the hbef are within the critical thresholds suggested to have adverse effects on forest growth
