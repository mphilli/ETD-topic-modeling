performance improvement school development program more effective schools success for all reform new york city whole-school reform models are school-level interventions that address multiple aspects of school operations and are intended to improve student performance this dissertation examines three specific whole-school reform models the school development program more effective schools and success for all the primary purpose of the study is to determine the impacts that a school's decision to adopt one of these whole-school reform models has on student academic performance in addition to reviewing evidence provided by existing evaluations the dissertation presents a quasi-experimental evaluation of whole-school reform efforts undertaken in new york city during the mid-1990s the study sample consists of 47 new york city elementary schools that adopted one of the three whole-school reform models as well as 42 randomly selected comparison schools individual-level panel data on students from each school in the study sample are used to estimate model impacts on reading and math performance the estimation procedures used including difference-in-differences-in-differences and instrumental variables pay careful attention to potential biases created by the self-selected nature of the treatment group the study finds that the school development program and more effective schools had small positive impacts on student performance in both math and reading students who were exposed to the school development program beginning in first grade by fifth grade show average reading scores that were 024 standard deviations higher and math scores that were 021 standard deviations higher than we might have expected in the absence of model adoption students exposed to more effective schools beginning in first or second grade by fifth grade show reading scores that are 031 standard deviations higher and math scores that are 035 standard deviations higher than we would have expected in absence of the model however estimated impacts of more effective schools several years after adoption are smaller and statistically insignificant suggesting that improvements are not maintained statistically significant positive impacts were not found for success for all implications of the analysis for policy and future research are detailed in the concluding chapter
