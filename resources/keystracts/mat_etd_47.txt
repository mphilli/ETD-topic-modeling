mathematics hilbert functions in this thesis we are concerned with the uniform properties of finite sets of points in projective space the hilbert function of a variety v in p\spn gives for each degree d the codimension in the entire family of hypersurfaces of degree d of the subfamily of hypersurfaces of degree d that contain v using the value of the hilbert function j harris defined the uniform position property for finite sets of points in projective space extending the notion used in the hilbert function to include varieties of arbitrary codimension one can define an integer valued function gxf for each given hilbert polynomial f and an irreducible component x of the hilbert scheme hilb\sbspp\spnf for any finite set y of points in p\spn\ gxfy gives the codimension in x of \omega\sby the set of points in x corresponding to the varieties in p\spn that contain y this dissertation is based on the study of the function gxf and the uniform properties resulting from it chapter i contains the introduction to the problem and the necessary preliminary definitions chapter ii starts with the generalized hilbert function gxf and studies the properties of gxf and the set \omega in chapter iii a uniform property based on gxf is defined and studied and its relation with other existing uniform properties is explored a weaker version of the uniform position lemma of j harris based on the newly defined uniform hilbert property is proved in chapter iv some unanswered questions and interesting problems are also identified in chapter iv
