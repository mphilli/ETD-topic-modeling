information extraction question-answer systems visual information browsing language processing this research focuses on the use of computational linguistics methods to process unstructured text and automatically extract meaningful information in order to provide users with a variety of information access tools appropriate to their specific needs recognizing that differing types of information need exist taylor 1968 that might not be satisfied by traditional information retrieval ir systems alone this research is founded on the premise that sophisticated information access methods in conjunction with a traditional ir system can satisfy users' varying information needs better than exclusive reliance on an ir system a second premise is that automatic information extraction processes enable sophisticated information access methods such as question-answering visual browsing of unstructured textual informationto fully demonstrate these premises a natural language processing nlp based domain-independent information extraction framework is needed that can convert the semantic content of unstructured texts into structured knowledge representations this domain-independent and automatic semantic analysis of text similar to human capability has been beyond the computational capabilities of nlp previous state of the art work has been done in very narrow and specific domains muc-3 muc-4 muc-5 and muc-6 to populate pre-configured databases using automatic semantic processing and information extractionthe research described here is an attempt to integrate a domain-independent semantic interpretation of text using the conceptual graph model sowa 1984 as an integral part of an automatic information extraction system to enable multiple modes of novel information access for users the novel information extraction framework described herein has been shown to be useful in populating knowledge bases for automated reasoning applications for question-answering when users have very specific information needs and for populating a visual browser for when users' needs are vaguethe approach is limited to the extraction of the subject and factual content of textual information logical content often revealed by quantifiers and modals within text is important for hypothetical or counter-factual reasoning and an autonomous problem-solving system but is beyond the scope of this research
