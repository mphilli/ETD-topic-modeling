nineteenth century actresses writers rhetorical performance inscription embodiment resistance feminist rhetorical analyses have tended to focus on women engaged in persuasive discourse in the public sphere--suffragists for example or abolitionists my examination of three actresswriters looks beyond such respectable rhetorics and seeks to make a significant contribution to the field of rhetoric in two key ways first this study offers an opportunity to better understand how women of the nineteenth century negotiated and challenged cultural scripts around gender class and work second i demonstrate what feminist rhetorics and theatre history can offer each other in terms of analytical frameworks and sites for analysis adah isaacs menken 1835-1868 anna cora mowatt 1819-1870 and ada clare 1836-1874 left records in the form of reviews autobiography fiction and photographs my analysis deploys the concept of rhetorical performance which broadly defined refers to an expressive act embodied and enacted by an individual subject with its roots in feminist rhetorics and theatre history and informed by recent work in performance studies this understanding of rhetorical performance assumes there  is a script or rather multiple and conflicting scripts as individual subjects adapt and enact those scripts within particular rhetorical moments they unconsciously alter and consciously resist those scripts through their performances chapter two considers the ways in which dominant discourses of womanhood worked to constrain and enable the female subject and examines how mowatt and clare reinterpreted the scripts of sentimental culture to create greater agency for themselves chapter three moves from an emphasis on inscription  on  the body to the work of the body directing my analysis to onstage and photographic performances of menken i argue that she used her body tactically as a bad subject even as that body was used against her chapter four focuses on strategies of self-representation in various genres considering how these women consciously crafted public personas finally chapter five considers future applications of rhetorical performance as an analytical framework in order to investigate the role of contemporary celebrity culture in constructing and maintaining particular ways of being as popular performance masquerades as mere entertainment obscuring its material impacts new critical literacies are needed to challenge dominant discourses
