women allergies chronic illness there has been little sociological consideration or even public discussion about the realities of women who live with allergies in this study i demonstrate how women with a chronic illness negotiate an at-risk society it is a society that deems these women's own health as constantly at risk of sickness and therefore places them responsible for not only recognizing the risk but maintaining their health in light of this risk this research examines how women with diagnosed allergies learn about construct and live in a society that is often if not always potentially a risk for their health this is a story about how women fit and fashion allergies and necessary treatment into their everyday lives it is also a story of how these women construct allergic identities these women artfully and skillfully create and re-create strategies for managing their desired health status within a society that often contests their own perceptions and experiences with illness such that they emerge successfully as healthy women regardless of the public's perceptions of illness complex understandings of both themselves and their social worlds influence and help them to constitute interactions in and with a world that potentially could make them ill these women are not only bodies who experience illness but women who have lived and chosen health on a daily basis
