soil solution stream water hardwood forest wollastonite calcium in this dissertation i examined the response of a forest watershed with acidic soil and surface waters to changes in calcium ca supply watershed 1 w1 that has been impacted by acidic deposition at the hubbard brook experimental forest in new hampshire usa was experimentally treated with calcium silicate casio 3   wollastonite in october 1999exchangeable ca ex-ca soil ph s  in 001m cacl 2   effective cation exchange capacity cec e   and effective base saturation bs e   increased while exchangeable acidity ex-acid decreased in organic soil horizons of w1 following wollastonite treatment mineral soil experienced either small increases in ex-ca phs cec e   bs  e   small decreases in ex-acid or no changes soil solutions draining the forest floor responded to the treatment by increases in concentrations of ca h 4  sio 4   ph and acid neutralizing capacity anc and decreases in inorganic monomeric al al i   positive correlations between caal i  in soil solution and ex-caex-al ratios in soil indicated that changes in the chemistry of soils significantly influenced the chemistry of soil water and that ca derived from the dissolution of wollastonite mitigated the mobilization of al wollastonite addition also significantly increased concentrations and fluxes of ca 2   h 4  sio 4   ph and anc and decreased concentrations and fluxes ofal i  in stream water at all elevations although mean values of ca 2  decreased slightly from 338 to 317 moll with increasing stream discharge in w1 the mean value of anc was positive 12 eql  during summer storm events compared to negative values -02 eql in an untreated reference watershed this response was presumably due to enhanced ca 2  supply in w1 207 to 290 of dissolved ca 2  derived from wollastonite to stream water as a result of interflow along shallow flowpaths approximately 3 of the added ca and 10 of the added si were exported through the stream outlet from the spruce-fir-white birch sfb 2 and 6 from the high-elevation hardwood hh 2 and 7 from the low-elevation hardwood lh subcatchments respectively over the six-year study period most of the added ca remained in soil exchange site of the forest floor but influenced the acid-base status of soil solutions and stream water
