delay optimal resource allocation qos wireless networks recent years have witnessed a significant growth in wireless communication and networking due to the exponential growth in mobile applications and smart devices fueling unprecedented increase in both mobile data traffic and energy demand among such data traffic real-time data transmissions in wireless systems require certain quality of service qos constraints eg in terms of delay buffer overflow or packet droploss probabilities so that acceptable performance levels can be guaranteed for the end-users especially in delay sensitive scenarios such as live video transmission interactive video eg teleconferencing and mobile online gaming with this motivation statistical queuing constraints are considered in this thesis imposed as limitations on the decay rate of buffer overflow probabilities in particular the throughput and energy efficiency of different types of wireless network models are analyzed under qos constraints and optimal resource allocation algorithms are proposed to maximize the throughput or minimize the delayin the first part of the thesis the throughput and energy efficiency analysis for hybrid automatic repeat request harq protocols are conducted under qos constraints approximations are employed for small qos exponent values in order to obtain closed-form expressions for the throughput and energy efficiency metrics also the impact of random arrivals deadline constraints outage probability and qos constraints are studied for the same system setting the throughput of harq system is also analyzed using a recurrence approach which provides more accurate results for any value of the qos exponent similarly random arrival models and deadline constraints are considered and these results are further extended to the finite-blocklength coding regimenext cooperative relay networks are considered under qos constraints specifically the throughput performance in the two-hop relay channel two-way relay channel and multi-source multi-destination relay networks is analyzed finite-blocklength codes are considered for the two-hop relay channel and optimization over the error probabilities is investigated for the multi-source multi-destination relay network model the throughput for both cases of with and without csi at the transmitter sides is studied when there is perfect csi at the transmitter transmission rates can be varied according to instantaneous channel conditions when csi is not available at the transmitter side transmissions are performed at fixed rates and decoding failures lead to retransmission requests via an arq protocolfollowing the analysis of cooperative networks the performance of both half-duplex and full-duplex operations is studied for the two-way multiple input multiple output mimo system under qos constraints in full-duplex mode the self-interference inflicted on the reception of a user due to simultaneous transmissions from the same user is taken into account in this setting the system throughputis formulated by considering the sum of the effective capacities of the users in both half-duplex and full-duplex modes the low signal to noise ratio snr regime is considered and the optimal transmissionpower-allocation strategies are characterized by identifying the optimal input covariance matricesnext mode selection and resource allocation for device-to-device d2d cellular networks are studied as the starting point  ransmission mode selection and resource allocation are analyzed for a time-division multiplexed tdm cellular network with one cellular user one base station and a pair of d2d users under rate and qos constraints for a more complicated setting with multiple cellular and d2d users two joint mode selection and resource allocation algorithms are proposed in the first algorithm the channel allocation problem is formulated as a maximum-weight matching problem which can be solved by employing the hungarian algorithm in the second algorithm the problem is divided into three subproblems namely user partition power allocation and channel assignment and a novel three-step method is proposed by combining the algorithms designed for the three subproblemsin the final part of the thesis resource allocation algorithms are investigated for content delivery over wireless networks three different systems are considered initially a caching algorithm is designed which minimizes the average delay of a single-cell network the proposed algorithm is applicable in settings with very general popularity models with no assumptions on how file popularity varies among different users and this algorithm is further extended to a more general setting in which the system parameters and the distributions of channel fading change over time next for d2d cellular networks operating under deadline constraints a scheduling algorithm is designed which manages mode selection channel allocation and power maximization with acceptable complexity this proposed scheduling algorithm is designed based on the convex delay cost method for a d2d cellular network with deadline constraints in an ofdma setting power optimization algorithms are proposed for all possible modes based on our utility definition finally a two-step intercell interference ici-aware scheduling algorithm is proposed for cloud radio access networks c-rans which performs user grouping and resource allocation with the goal of minimizing delay violation probability a novel user grouping algorithm is developed for the user grouping step which controls the interference among the users in the same group and the channel assignment problem is formulated as a maximum-weight matching problem in the second step which can be solved using standard algorithms in graph theory
