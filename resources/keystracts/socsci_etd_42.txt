empowerment difference parent involvement work teachers community organizing while parent involvement in schools is heralded as a rite of democratic participation and a panacea for educational ills the discourses that surround it reveal otherwise these discourses demonstrate how often so-called involvement works against collaboration among parents and between parents and teachers squelches the vitality of parent activism glosses over tensions and differences among school stakeholders and contradicts the popular concept of empowerment through parent voice through interviews and participant observation this project highlights the talk of parents and schoolworkers around a high school in upstate new york critical questions and understandings of how power plays out in a discourse of parent involvement unfold through concepts of work difference and empowerment first parent involvement is viewed as a work process taken up by individual parents and schoolworkers while intersecting with institutional policies and practices a concept of work makes visible how power reproduces parent involvement as a category through which to manage control and deflect the impact parents can have on schools second a concept of difference examines the positioning including othering  of parents in a zero-sum game for education and the glossing over of power relations that structure their experiences which provide hints for how parents become isolated from one another and from their children's educators in the formidable task of educational change third people's talk reveals tensions in what it means to so-called empower parents through institutionally driven practices to involve public school stakeholders in processes of change meanwhile the dialectic found in interrupted dialogues and in rifts between visions and voices among educators and parents indicate paths toward what is implied by the notion of empowermentif parent involvement is to become a part of the effort to fundamentally change how our schools operate i argue that it must be grounded in effective community organizing strategies and engaged in praxis  only when reflection and practice inform one another in an ongoing process will educators parents students and other school stakeholders be enabled to investigate together how they will become effective advocates for educational change
