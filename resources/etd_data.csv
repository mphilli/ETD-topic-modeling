tl_etd_246,"""Being Grown"": How Adolescent Girls with Disabilities Narrate Self-Determination and Transitions",Teaching and Leadership,"Adolescent girls, Equity, Gender, Self-determination, Special education, Transitions","Across the United States young women with disabilities are experiencing economic and educational disadvantages. Although post-school outcomes have shown improvement, young women continue to experience high unemployment rates, low wages, and high rates of poverty. In this study, I explore the experiences of four teenage girls who have been labeled as having learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities. Through in-depth interviews, supported collage making, document review, and the AIR Self-Determination Scale, I examine how they experience girlhood, schooling, and transitions. I consider the ways in which adolescent girls with disabilities negotiate special education, social relationships, and the salient and permeable borders of girlhood and adulthood. I consider how the policies and practices of special education both produce and police gendered narratives of behavior and compliance.I also examine the liminal space of post-school transitions. I contemplate issues of equity and access to opportunity, while examining the consequences of labeling, segregation, and interlocking systems of oppression such as race, class, and gender on these opportunities. Further, I consider the participants' diverse understandings of and experiences with self-determination. In the conclusion, I present a framework for a more equitable and culturally responsive approach to transitions and describe the implications of this study for teachers, parents, students, and teacher preparation programs."

In addition, this study looked at the initial attitudes of the students and their knowledge of evolution before beginning a second semester introductory biology course. Both the initial attitudes and knowledge of the students and the gains in positive attitudes and knowledge were measured using the Evolutionary Attitudes and Literacy Survey (EALS). The goal of the research was to analyze potential gains using a quasi-experimental design with pre-test/post-test comparison between a control group and a treatment group. The control group and treatment group differed in that throughout the course of the semester, the treatment group was assigned pre-laboratory work using the ""Evo in the News"" tool while the control group was assigned pre-lab work without ""Evo in the News"". Although it was anticipated that the students would begin the semester at a higher level of knowledge and positive attitudes than the general population, the findings suggested that a large percentage of the students harbored significant misconceptions, lack of understanding, and negative attitudes regarding biological evolution at the beginning of the semester. At the conclusion of the semester, significant gains were found in two constructs on the EALS. The treatment group showed significant improvement in one attitudes construct, relevance of evolution, and in one knowledge construct, genetic literacy when the pre-surveys and post-surveys were compared. Additional findings demonstrated a significant correlation between positive attitudes toward evolution and knowledge of evolution. Also, significant correlations were found between both positive attitudes toward and knowledge of evolution and the students' level of achievement as measured by their final course grades."
etd_16,"""From the American People"": Aid, Counterinsurgency, and the U.S. National Security State in Palestine",Geography,"Counterinsurgency, Humanitarianism, Israel/Palestine, Liberal War, Political Geography, Sovereignty","Palestine has long been a key node in circuits of global counterinsurgency. Under the British Mandate, the territory served as a staging ground for the consolidation of British imperial policing and pacification strategies, and following mandate rule, it has served as a testing ground for Israeli experiments in asymmetric warfare and demographic engineering. While counterinsurgency is often assumed to be kinetic, or related to outright violence and lethal force, its ""non-kinetic"" counterparts are often overlooked. This dissertation explores these dimensions to liberal warfare and counterinsurgency practice in Israel/Palestine. Drawing on over thirteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in the Palestinian territories on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the vast web of aid intermediaries, experts, lawyers, and contractors through which it operates, this dissertation traces the ways in which counterinsurgency and pacification strategies are being mobilized through the networks of aid governance. The central argument developed throughout this dissertation rests on three interrelated claims: First, I argue that the aid regime that has emerged over the last half century in the Palestinian territories is part and parcel of an ever-more elaborate regime of control that has produced new forms of discipline and dependency through the steady undermining of local networks, productive capacities and political formations across the West Bank and Gaza. Secondly, the case of Palestine, I argue, lends insight into the ways in which the practices and institutions we most often associate with liberal modernity are themselves invested with the force of war. Finally, in tracing the shared security practices and intensified forms of collaboration taking place between states, I argue that the processes unfolding in Israel/Palestine point to a reworking of sovereignty wherein the increasingly networked relations between sovereign powers are giving rise to a global security apparatus that monitors and disciplines populations of ""suspect civilians"" across borders."
soc_etd_75,"""My pedagogy is where so much of my feminism happens"": The Social Organization of Feminist Educators' Work in the Corporatizing Academy",Sociology,,"Feminist educators in higher education perform feminist politics through their teaching practices. Among other goals, their pedagogies often seek to critically examine and transgress relations of power and domination associated with ruling systems (e.g., white supremacy, capitalism, heteropatriarchy), and to ""create participatory spaces"" (hooks 1994:15) for productive dialogue, resistance, and change. At the same time, postsecondary institutions are becoming more corporate and entrepreneurial in their orientation and structure--a trend that is mostly inconsistent with feminist educators' political interests, work, and vision of the academy.Using institutional ethnography and referencing in-depth interviews with feminist educators and administrators from five postsecondary institutions in North America, I explore the teaching practices and professional work lives of feminist educators and examine the ways in which their work is shaped by the broader context of higher education. The following research questions guided this project: How do feminist educators understand and describe their teaching work in the academy? How are the teaching practices of feminist educators shaped by the institutional contexts in which they work? That is, what institutional and textual processes organize their decisions about teaching strategies, curriculum, and the allocation of time and energy? In particular, I examine the syllabus and regimes of assessment, evaluation, and accountability as they relate to and shape feminist educators' professional work lives.This analysis explores some of the ways that corporatization and the textually mediated social relations of the academy influence and restrict aspects of feminist educators' teaching work. Additionally, this analysis explores some of the strategies that feminist educators use to promote the discourse of feminism in the face of institutionalized pressures to silence, curtail, or weaken their efforts. In making feminist educators' work lives visible and revealing how feminist educators' work lives are organized by a text-based ruling apparatus, my hope is that readers gain a better awareness and understanding of the work that feminist educators do and how power operates in higher education. With this knowledge, we can develop effective strategies for addressing the concerns of feminists and other social justice educators on campus, and engage in productive dialogue about how educators' pedagogical practices can be used to challenge the neoliberal, corporate trends taking place in academia."
tl_etd_238,"""Roadblocks, Stop Signs"": Health Literacy, Education and Communication at a Free Medical Clinic",Teaching and Leadership,"Adult Education, Health Literacy, Marginalized Patients, Patient-Provider Communication","This qualitative study, which takes place in a free medical clinic for low-income and uninsured patients, addresses the patients' health literacy and access to health information inside and outside of the clinic setting, as well as the strategies clinic providers use to effectively communicate health information. This study is based on participant observation in an urban clinic in the Northeast, interviews of 22 patients and 20 health-care providers, and direct observation of the patient/provider communication in nine instances. In the clinic, the providers serve as educators for vulnerable, stressed patients, who are adult learners. The patients were interviewed in order to understand their health education needs, their comprehension of the health information that they received at the clinic, and their access to health information outside of the clinic. The providers, who were volunteers at the clinic, were interviewed to understand their strategies to effectively communicate with their patients. This study, therefore, provides insights into how adults learn in nonformal educational settings and what strategies appear to be effective to communicate with people who are marginalized and stressed."
rel_etd_84,"""She's an All-in-One Guru"": Devotion to a 21st century Mystic",Religion,"gurus, Hinduism, India, Saints, spirituality, women","Anandmurti Gurumaa is a multi-lingual teacher of meditation and ""spirituality"" situated at the intersection of Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi and Sikh mystical traditions. This dissertation, employing inter-disciplinary methodology, provides an in-depth study of Gurumaa and her rapidly developing, disciple-driven transnational spiritual movement. I introduce Gurumaa and her circle of devotees within the cultural context of globetrotting Indian gurus and examine issues of tradition and innovation in her mission. Through ethnographic writing, I specifically turn to examples of Gurumaa's pluralism, gender activism and embrace of new media to discuss continuity and change within the tradition of guru-bhakti (devotion to the guru). Because Gurumaa embraces rhetoric of ""female empowerment,"" and points to her own ""enlightened"" female body as evidence that women can and do reach the highest spiritual states, her leadership offers an ideal context in which to consider emerging gendered re-interpretations of ""tradition"" in the new global religious milieu."
etd_345,"""Someday my Prince Will Come"":  A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Gender and Romantic Relationships in Selected  Feature-Length Disney Animated Films from 1937-2007",Media Studies,,"Through its animated films, the Disney Company presents definitions of gender to both children and adults. In addition to gender representation, romantic Disney films thread love and the quest for romantic relationships throughout the story. Given that minimal research exists on the portrayal of romantic relationships and its correlation to gender, the purpose was to study stereotypical actions of female characters; gender differences in verbally and nonverbally communicating love and its importance; and ultimately a character's transformation as the result of the attainment of a romantic relationship.This study employed a mixed-methods approach. A content analysis of 12 romantic Disney animated films was used to explore the portrayals of love dependent upon gender and time. Qualitative analysis was used to further explore love's relationship to the portrayal of stereotypical actions, and characters' goals such as domesticity.While none of the hypotheses yielded statistical support, an examination of descriptive data does illustrate trends consistent with prior research and in support of the hypotheses. A qualitative analysis of Cinderella and The Little Mermaid enriches these findings."
etd_111,"""That's me in the game"": Being present and identifying avatar",Mass Communications,"Avatar, Embodied experience, Media violence, Neuroimaging, Presence, Virtual environment","Customization of an in-game character, or ""avatar,"" is a core feature in modern video games and has the capacity to exert a profound impact on the user experience. This dissertation is concerned with the question of how the appearance of a users' avatar influences them - specifically how avatars that look like the users affect the sense of their body, their behavior in the virtual environment, and the psychological effects of the virtual environment. The question is explored through two separate but related studies.The first study focuses on how avatar customization and realism can reduce the possible adverse effects of violent video games while maintaining high levels of enjoyment. Results from both self-report measures and physiological stress reactivity (assessed by heart rate variability) indicate that participants, who are able to customize or create self-resembling avatars, experience less stress and aggressive thoughts, more enjoyment, and greater presence in the game, while exhibiting less aggressive and more prosocial behaviors. Thus, avatar customization was shown to have a positive effect on users' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed in terms of media violence effects.The second study utilizes neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) to investigate possible neural correlates of embodied experience through the avatar, specifically how the human brain responds to different types of avatar embodiment (deindividuated vs. self-resembling bodies). Results from both self-report and regional brain activity measures (changes in cerebral hemodynamics) reveal different levels of activation in the supplementary motor area by the types of avatar and indicate that this brain region is associated with subjective embodied experience. A key finding of this study was a strong negative correlation of the neural activity in the supplementary motor area with the behavioral level of embodied experience (i.e., the experience of being engaged with the actions of the avatar). Possible interpretations of this finding are discussed in terms of avatar self-identification and avatar embodiment."
geo_etd_75,"""The Canal Is in the Hands of the Conspirators"": Fear of Traffickers and Transport Workers in the British North Atlantic and the Port of New York, 1840-1940",Geography,"Social sciences, British North Atlantic, Port of New York, Traffickers, Transport workers","This dissertation looks at the retrenchment of entire modes of transportation. I look in particular at divestments from shipping canals and from harbor boats. I also discuss divestments from certain kinds of animal transportation, especially mules.Many preceding scholars have generally attributed the decline of these transport techniques to economic factors. These scholars explain the decline of canals as a function of the rise of the faster railroads; the decline of downtown waterfronts as a function of the rise of supposedly more efficient containerization technologies; and the decline of transport animals as a function of the rise of numerous modes of motorized transport. I argue that even if such economic factors have certainly been important, they cannot adequately explain the demise of the transport modes which interest me, many of whose politically and economically valuable capabilities were never satisfactorily replaced by the transport methods that emerged in their place. In the cases I look at, I stress the likelihood that an important but overlooked factor militating against continued investment in the given retrenched transport technology--whether canal boat, harbor boat, or draft animal--was the technology's real or perceived association with, and use by, politically rebellious groups for the purposes of clandestine, subversive trafficking.I go into particular depth examining two such cases. One case is the demise of ship-canal building within the British Empire between 1870 and 1920. Another is the history of elite refusals to invest in New York City's inner-city waterfront, from the 1920s onward. And in a final, somewhat more exploratory case, I look at animal transportation, in particular at the U.S. Military's decision to deactivate its mule corps during the 1950s."
etd_320,"""The Terror Within:"" Neoliberalism and the Rhetoric of the Obesity Crisis",Writing Program,"Citizenship, Fat Studies, Feminist Rhetoric, Neoliberalism, Rhetoric of the body","This dissertation focuses on specific discourses within the rhetoric of the ""obesity crisis"" that position the fat body as a threat to U.S. military power and national identity. Since 9/11, there has been a growing rhetoric that frames obesity as a threat to national security that is weakening U.S. military forces and straining the U.S. economy through increased health care costs and lower worker productivity. Drawing on research from rhetorical studies, transnational feminism, and disability studies that highlight the way that discourses surrounding the body are used to limit access to citizenship and rhetorical agency, this research analyzes the material and discursive effects of nationalist rhetorics of obesity.The project begins with an analysis of John F. Kennedy's 1960 article ""The Soft American,"" which worried that declining rates of fitness in the U.S. would lead to defeat in the Cold War and ultimately led to the development of the Presidential Fitness Program. This analysis of Kennedy works to contextualize the analysis of a variety of specific contemporary sites where a nationalist rhetoric of obesity emerges, including the work of the lobbying organization ""Mission: Readiness,"" the Centers for Disease Control-funded documentary series Weight of the Nation, and the First Lady Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" campaign. The analysis of these sites shows that a nationalist rhetoric of obesity has developed as a response to the contradictions of neoliberalism, deflecting attention from the failures of the neoliberal state and encouraging citizen-consumers to buy their way to a thinner body. A nationalist rhetoric of obesity further normalizes the body and creates thinness as a condition of citizenship, ultimately reinforcing and deepening existing marginalizations based on race, gender, class, and ability.Through its methodology, this dissertation project builds on rhetorical work in transnational feminism like that being done by Rebecca Dingo, Jennifer Wingard, and Eileen Schell. The project also draws on the work of rhetorical disability scholars like Jay Dolmage, Cynthia Lewiecki-Wilson, and Margaret Price as it highlights the way discourses surrounding the body are used to limit access to citizenship and to rhetorical agency. In addition to blending transnational feminist and disability theory as critical frameworks, this project works to bring rhetorical studies into conversation with the relatively new field of fat studies-a field that challenges the medicalization of fat and deconstructs the stigma surrounding fatness in order to promote more just body politics."

Part landscape analysis, part ethnography, and by most substantially relying on narrative and lengthy excerpts from interviews, I challenge the dominant notion that Minnesota is a non-Native space. Rather, Mni Sota Makoce, the land where the waters reflect the sky, with a place called Bdote at its center, forms the traditional territory of the Dakota Oyate, the Dakota Nation. More specifically, this thesis tells a story about Dakota peoples' struggle to maintain and assert their relationships to urban public spaces in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Region as indisputably Dakota places."
etd_210,"""We're all Horacians"": Listening to international students at an American liberal arts college",Cultural Foundations of Education,"Internationalization of Higher Education, International Students, Liberal Arts Colleges","The current intensifying climate of internationalized higher education has led to feverishly increased recruitment of international students in and beyond the United States. Amidst competition for this student population, the complexity of the international student experience, the voices of internationals, and the focus on individuals' lives are of lesser consequence than mapping global flows and tracking aggregate trends through statistical measures and meta-level reporting. As a result, international students in the twenty-first century are often commodified, homogenized, and Othered in the scholarships to which they are a subject and on the campuses in which they are enrolled. However, I contend - and show in this dissertation - that these students are also powerful commentators on their own lives who share invaluable insights about international study, the situatedness of globally mobile persons navigating transnational social fields, and the ways in which international students are agential actors within the globalized system of higher education.In this qualitative case study dissertation, I investigate salient dimensions of internationals' lives at Horace College, a Midwestern liberal arts college, by mapping and analyzing the self-reported stories and the perceptions of my informants. Based on nine months of fieldwork, I explore the particular contours of internationalization, international student inclusion, and diversity within the social justice legacy of and liberal arts mission at Horace College. I also give attention to how international students and other participants perceive the moniker ""Horacian"" and the ways in which this label has implications for expectations regarding international student ""adjustment"" and relationships between domestic and international peers on campus. Finally, I investigate meanings internationals ascribe to the term ""international student"" as well as the transnational ties to family, friends, and home countries most salient to these students' experience at and beyond Horace."

In 1954, the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors voted to withhold funding to public schools in reaction to the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling. Public schools remained closed for five years in this county. The White community created and sustained a private segregation academy. The Black community worked to provide a variety of programs to keep students engaged. In 1963, the Kennedy Administration took note of the Black community's plight. Black community leaders and members of the Kennedy Administration worked to establish the Free School Association, a one-year temporary solution to the school closure crisis. The Free School made plain its intention to provide students with the skills they believed necessary for becoming active citizens despite the obstructions placed upon them by the White community.     Through archival research and interviews, this dissertation examines the Free School's reading, writing, and speaking curriculum. I argue for an understanding of the curriculum as a blend of a traditional skills-based approach to writing coupled with a commitment to honor the communities of the students. The presentation of this history complicates our notions about rhetorical education, citizenship, and race"
ant_etd_96,"""Women With No One"": Community and Christianity in a Secular South Indian Homeless Shelter",Anthropology,"Ethics, Morality, Pluralism, Rehabilitation, Religion, Tamil Nadu","This dissertation examines daily life and social service practices in a secular homeless shelter for women in Tamil Nadu, south India. The residents of the shelter have diverse backgrounds but local staff members and volunteers describe them collectively as ""women with no one"": unwed mothers, orphans, widows, women abandoned or abused by husbands and lovers, former sex workers, prisoners' wives, and women deemed mentally or physically unfit for marriage. Daily negotiations of belonging take place among this transient and diverse group of marginalized women and equally diverse and transnational care providers. The closed shelter campus provides an opportunity to query the everyday experience of secularism and pluralism. Shelter board members emphasize these concepts as guiding principles of the institution. Indeed, they are touted in many settings as a necessary and laudable framework for democratic life in globalized and increasingly diverse populations. But how do individuals and communities, in everyday life and interactions, understand and engage with such abstract ideals?Ethnographic research, conducted between August 2008 and August 2009, revealed important insights regarding the ideals shaping the secular goals of the shelter, namely women's social rehabilitation. First, the definition of secularism cannot be assumed and is not universal. Inline with commonsense equations of secularism and pluralism in India, the secular goals of the shelter involved passionate displays of religious conviction, continuous ethical deliberation, and reflection on cultural ideals of womanhood and family. Secularism, in other words, was a religious, cultural, and gendered idea and practice. Second, just as there were many secularisms, many Christianities were embodied and articulated within the shelter. The institution depended on various local and international Christian communities for donations of time and money. They each had different understandings of the relationship between Christianity and women's social rehabilitation. Third, cultural ideals are fragile. The social stigma faced by women living outside of patriarchal family structures and the forced intimacy of women with diverse backgrounds living together on a closed campus emphasized this fact. Faced with the fragility of social and cultural ideals, women at the shelter took great risks to forge new terms of belonging, community, and womanhood."

A Discourse with College Students with Learning Disabilities on their Experiences with Self-Determination, Self-Advocacy, and Stigma in Secondary and Postsecondary Education",Teaching and Leadership,"Disability, Self-Advocacy, Self-Determination, Stigma","The purpose of this study was to learn about the participants' academic and social experiences in high school and college as students with a learning disability. In particular, this study focused on the self-determination of college students with learning disabilities, how they understand the concept of self-advocacy, and how they utilize self-advocacy skills in educational settings. Eleven college students with learning disabilities participated in one-on-one in-depth interviews at a university in the Northeastern United States. The data was informed by Carol Dweck's theoretical work on motivation and intelligence and Erving Goffman's stigma theory. The results of this study provide insight into how students with learning disabilities navigate college, particularly around their views of motivation and self-determination, which related to their belief in an ""incremental"" view of intelligence that focuses on effort, not native ability, leading to success. Contrary to subscribing to the latter ""entity"" of view of intelligence, the students maintained that with effort, hard work, and perseverance, they can be successful academically and act as strong self-advocates. Most of the participants identified their parents or other close family members as vital to their understanding of and ability to self-advocate, which casts a strong light on the influence of familial support in students' development of self-advocacy skills. Students reflected that stigmatization was often attached to the special education high school environment, but it could also occur at the college setting, particularly when students utilized disability accommodations during exams. With its focus on self-determination, self-advocacy, and stigma, this study provides rich and interesting insight into the educational lives of eleven students with learning disabilities and the struggles and successes they faced as learners pursuing a common goal of completing their postsecondary education."
wp_etd_35,(re)Constructing a Landmark: A Rhetorical Analysis of Brown v Board of Education at Fifty,Writing Program,"Brown v Board, epideictic, public memory, rhetoric","This dissertation examines the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary with emphasis on its civic and social rhetorical functions. The analysis focuses on the two week period leading up to the fiftieth anniversary and the dedication of the Brown v Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka. Data was gathered from various web sites related to the National Historic Site and the events in Topeka on the weekend it was dedicated, and from database records of national and international news sources. These materials were analyzed in three categories beginning with the Site itself and moving outward from Topeka to the national media response. The author argues that Brown functions in two ways that rival its function as law: first, as a tool of statecraft, a symbolic representation of America's highest ideals around which community is built through epideictic performances; and second as a dialectic, a proposition around which there continues to be an asynchronous conversation on how to achieve, or continue to move toward, the promise of Brown. Understanding the reconstruction of Brown at its fiftieth anniversary and the continued need for rhetorical efforts to bring about its promises underscores the value of studying judicial rhetoric from a rhetorical perspective, both to understand its civic and social function and to recognize the limits of law to achieve social change."

It does so first by examining the networks' 1989 coverage and assessing the themes and ideologies circulated when the Berlin Wall's opening was breaking news. These themes and ideologies are used as a baseline to assess anniversary coverage that aired from 1990 through 2009. In the process of this close reading, special attention is paid to silences and omissions amid itin images and spoken discourses; the circulation of World War II and Holocaust-related discourses; and the influence of hypermediacy and liveness on the programming. The results show that the coverage coheres into two distinct typologies: anniversary-as-process and anniversary-as-spectacle, two new concepts introduced by this dissertation. The implications for anniversary journalism, public memory of the Berlin Wall and collective memory of World War II are discussed."

Using research in sociology of disaster and uses and gratifications theory in mass communication, data collected included original music written in response to the hurricane, major benefit concerts that aired in the wake, and re-appropriated music that developed new meaning when used in conjunction to the case.  Analysis yielded that popular music was used to raise awareness, raise funds, and express emotion following the disaster. Common themes throughout include the impact of genre on how this was accomplished and the messages it yielded, the power of collective effervescence, and the importance of space and place when dealing with tragedy through music."

This community is unique in that it administers the only Sh??? mosque on an island that has the highest concentration of mosques in the Western Hemisphere. Another interesting feature of this community is that the overwhelming majority of its elders are “double” converts, given that they journeyed from Christianity to Sunn? Islam and later to Sh??? Islam. The historical trajectory of this community, along with its distinct status within the polyethnic Trinidadian polity, serve as fascinating foundations for further inquiry.The most important event on this community’s calendar is undoubtedly ??sh?r?? or the tenth day of the Islamic month of Muharram, which marks the martyrdom of the third Sh??? Imam ?usayn ibn ?Al? ibn Ab? ??lib, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. During the first ten days of Muharram, Sh??? Muslims the world over evoke the tragedy that befell Imam ?usayn and his small band of followers over fourteen centuries ago on the plains of Karbala. Muslims memorialize Karbala through a series of ritual observances that vary in different regional and cultural contexts.Based on fieldwork conducted in the latter half of 2015 and January 2016, this thesis will focus on the role of IZM’s Muharram observances in defining individual and collective identities. I engage with the work of several spatial and ritual theorists of religion to explore the complex interconnections between ritual, space and identity. I argue that the embodied and emplaced rituals performed in honor of Imam ?usayn provide IZM members with a space for the negotiation and articulation of self and community."

Conventional wisdom at the time portrayed Tinker and Tartikoff’s network decisions as desperate and unfocused. However, a closer look suggests that Tinker and Tartikoff essentially invented a hybrid of “highbrow/lowbrow/middlebrow” programming to combat the audience fragmentation brought on by the penetration of cable television."

The participants used college access programs to prepare themselves for, gain access to, and persist at a selective postsecondary institution directly after high school.  This research asked what skills and knowledge do first generation college students learn through their college access and support programs?  How do first generation college students use the skills and knowledge they obtained through their college access and support programs to help navigate their college-going journeys?  Using the theoretical frameworks of Communities of Cultural Wealth (Yosso, 2005, 2006) and critical theory (Kincheloe & McLaren, 2002), I analyzed the participants’ counterstories and uncovered how first generation college students used college access and success programs to navigate a historically classed and raced education system.  The findings centered the students’ stories, showed how college access programs became a form of capital within themselves for first generation college students, and provided students with the resources they needed to matriculate and persist in college.  I then critically examined whether or not college access programs contributed to closing the educational gap in the United States and educational reform."

This dissertation addresses the less well-understood dynamics of mainstream religious group participation in LGBTQ social movement.  Through frameworks of social movement theory, organizational culture, and queer theory, it explores the organizational elements shaping congregants’ practices in two Unitarian Universalist (UU) churches considered “Welcoming Congregations”.  Analysis of data generated from participant observations, in-depth interviews, and church and denominational texts highlight how structures of church governance, materiality, and history intersected with embedded discourses of gender and sexuality to promote “closeting” and “covering” repertoires of discourse and action on behalf of marriage equality. Findings underscore the value of continued research on the specific ways in which specific elements of organizational culture can shape local group discourses and practices at varying depths, degrees, and dimensions of organizational embeddedness."

Through social media, politicians have an opportunity to participate in meme sharing with their followers, and to gain valuable likeability points with them by doing so. Hillary Clinton is one such politician, who created a meta-meme by participating in a viral meme about her, and was able to have some control over the narrative about her image as a result. The present research examined the uses of and responses to political meta-meming through analysis of both Hillary Clinton’s meta-memes and the reactions to them in the news media as shared on social media. This thesis used a theoretical foundation of social presence theory, which in recent years has come to be used in a social media setting and can predict likeability based on effective participation in social media norms.

Participants from Liberia, Sudan, and Somalia relocated to the U. S. through refugee services between 2003 and 2006. At the time of the study, they were enrolled in mainstream English classrooms with American-born peers. Students with interrupted and limited formal education (SIFEs) like these young men are a growing yet understudied demographic in urban schools (DeCapua & Marshall, 2010; Fu, 2007).Through the use of writing activity genre research (Russell, 2009), New Literacies Studies (Gee, 2000; New London Group, 1996), and postcolonial theory (Said, 1978; Spivak, 1998), the study illuminates participants' perspectives on writing and makes suggestions for teaching adolescent youth, especially immigrant populations (Campano, 2007; Gutiérrez, 2008). The findings suggest that youth like these young men need help with navigating double binds (Engeström, 2009; Russell, 1997) experienced between home and school and benefit from stretch, skill, drill, practice, play, and reflect approaches to build writing proficiency. Participants desired more authentic writing opportunities in school where they could communicate with purposes and audiences that mattered to them. Participants wrote out of school, sought to learn genres that could benefit their families' lives, and wished for more inquiry-based writing instruction in school. Their reports suggest history and global realities of the 21st century should be better linked to pedagogy and that teachers need a better understanding of the complexities of race and how languages privilege and inhibit marginalized youth."
etd_36,A Blueprint for Kindergarteners' Educational Trajectories: The Power of Discursive Practices in Constructing Students' Stories Based on Behaviors,Teaching and Leadership,"Behavior, Disability studies, Inclusive education, Kindergarten education","Discursive practices enacted by educators in kindergarten create a blueprint for how the educational trajectories of students with disabilities get constructed. In this two-year ethnographic case study, I critically examine educators' relationships with students considered to present challenging behaviors in one classroom located in a predominantly White middle class school district. Focusing on the language and practices used by one special education teacher and three teaching assistants, I analyze how teacher responses to students' behaviors constructs and positions students over one year of kindergarten education. Using a critical discourse analysis, I was able to highlight how educators' language in the classroom reflects discourses of control, conditional membership, and expectations based on behavioral standards. The discursive practices, which exerted power and represented educators' understanding of students' behaviors as deficit and needing consequences, are not based solely on the behavior itself; instead, educators' responses reflect students' individual characteristics including race, family background, socioeconomics and ability status. I offer in depth analysis of six students' stories, which evidenced that the language used by educators amplifies the social positioning of students within the classroom and creates a foundation for who they are constructed to be. Through exploring routine language and practices, I demonstrate that educators outlined a blueprint of kindergartners, which positioned students as learners in ways that became the ground for either a limited or a promising educational pathway for them. Finally, I offer implications for educators that would lead to improved responses to behaviors in the classroom and, as a consequence, to a more positive educational experience for both students and educators."
etd_710,"A Civil Contract of Documentary: Israel, Palestine, and the Political Aesthetics of Documentary Intersubjective Witnessing, 2000-2017",English,"bearing witness, documentary film, Israel, Palestine, politics, subjectivity","The years following the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in September 2000 have witnessed an increase in the number of documentaries engaging with individual and collective Israeli and Palestinian subjectivities. During this same period, Israeli and U.S. regimes have mobilized the exclusionary rhetoric of national “security” and the “war on terror” to justify several legislative and geographically restrictive actions, exacerbating Palestinian communities’ ongoing experiences of dislocation and fragmentation, while mainstream media outlets throughout the west tend to focus on images of explosive violence, primarily rendering Palestinians visible as perpetrators of unwarranted violence. This dissertation complicates these oversimplified and partial images of the Israeli and Palestinian “conflict” by focusing on the politics of documentary aesthetic practices—including essayistic narrative structures, the incorporation of archival documents, animation, and interactive, digital forms—in films that attempt to visualize and navigate the complex and multi-scalar articulations of Israeli and Palestinian subjectivities. To this end, I argue that expanding Ariella Azoulay’s theory of the “civil contract of photography” to documentary film provides new ways to understand the complicated natures of transnational, affective, and ethically-based intersubjective relationships between filmmakers, filmed subjects, and audiences.The broader scholarship on subjectivity in documentary tends to apply a cultural studies lens—with an emphasis on multiculturalism and identity politics—or the “ethical turn’s” frame of affective, mutual responsibility. Azoulay’s model of the civil contract necessarily re-politicizes these conversations and the documentary as a space of intersubjective encounter. More specifically, recontextualizing and redefining “citizenship” within a visual experience of bearing witness pushes back against the universalization of U.S. and European understandings of politics in nationalist terms of “choice.” As such, this dissertation traces a trajectory from films that engage more explicitly with territorialized expressions of national identity, to online projects and apps that navigate between multi-scalar, collective subjectivities via the networked capabilities of digital media technologies. These works thus articulate a spectrum of Palestinian national identities that are rooted in practices of rebellion and resistance rather than solely in sovereign territory.Chapter one thus begins with an examination of Yulie Gerstel Cohen’s My Land Zion (2005), Avi Mograbi’s Avenge but One of My Two Eyes (2005), and Ibtisam Mar’ana’s Paradise Lost (2003) as first person essay films that use a meandering narrative structure—and its emphasis on subjective plurality—to anchor the filmmakers’ material and conceptual journeys of self-exploration, particularly in relation to the Israeli state’s colonialist architecture. In chapter two, I discuss Azza El-Hassan’s essayistic Kings & Extras (2004), Diana Allen’s ethnographic Still Life (2007) and Terrace of the Sea (2009), and Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi’s 5 Broken Cameras (2011) as films that reframe archival documents as “haptic” experiences of reception, encouraging audiences to view the dissonant textures of Palestinian memories and subjectivities. Chapter three considers Amer Shomali and Paul Cowan’s The Wanted 18 (2014) and Dahna Abourahme’s Kingdom of Women (2011) and their use of animation’s evocative function to raise ethical questions about the indexical root of documentary’s truth claims and to navigate between multi-scalar Palestinian subjectivities in ways that often unsettle and destabilize audiences’ relationship to territorially-rooted and masculinist definitions of national identity. And finally, in the conclusion I briefly speculate about how interactive documentaries, apps, and games offer opportunities to consider both the limitations and potentials of documentaries about Israeli and Palestinian subjectivities and their ability to construct political, transnational relationships among the governed."
etd_134,A Comparison of Descriptive and Injunctive Norms Brief Interventions for College Drinkers,Psychology,"alcohol use, brief intervention, college students, descriptive norms, injunctive norms, path analysis","College drinking remains a major public health concern. One contributing factor is the overestimation by college students of their peers' alcohol use (DN: descriptive norm) and their peers' acceptability of excessive drinking (IN: injunctive norm). Normative re-education interventions have traditionally focused on changing descriptive norms even though the Theory of Normative Conduct identifies both DN and IN as beliefs that motivate behavior. The current study developed a brief, manualized, personalized, IN intervention, delivered face-to-face, in a Motivational Interviewing style that can be used as a stand alone treatment or added to existing descriptive norms interventions. This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of the newly developed IN intervention against a DN only condition, a combined DN and IN condition, and an assessment only control condition. In addition, the current study examined actual-ideal discrepancy, and positive and negative affect as potential mechanisms of behavior change following norms feedback. The results indicated that all three norms intervention conditions changed both DN and IN equally. In addition, heavy drinking students reported greater reductions in drinking following the IN only or the combined intervention then heavy drinking students in the DN only condition. Tests of indirect effects from treatment condition to actual-ideal discrepancy to positive or negative affect to alcohol use and consequences were only significant for light drinkers. This study provides evidence that changes in DN and IN result from either form of feedback, and that these changes do not necessarily result in changes in drinking. Further, changes in actual-ideal discrepancy were highly associated with affective changes, but affective changes were not associated with outcomes."
etd_190,A Critical Race and Critical Whiteness Theory Analysis of Preservice Teachers' Racialized Practices in a Literacy Across the Curriculum Course,Reading and Language Arts,"critical race theory, critical whiteness theory, culturally based pedagogy, literacy across the curriculum, racialized practices, teacher education","The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the racialized practices enacted by seven preservice teachers while they participated in a university-based literacy across the curriculum course that included a school-based tutoring component.  Research questions asked: 1) what racialized practices were enacted by preservice content-area teachers when they participated in a required literacy across the curriculum course that included one-on-one tutoring of youth at an urban secondary school, and 2) how did preservice content-area teachers' backgrounds contribute to their racialized practices?This study drew on the premises of critical race theory and critical whiteness theory to define racialized practices.  The study began with these theories' assumptions that race is an important social construction in U.S. society that is used to position people hierarchically, especially oppressing people of color.  Racialized practices are ways of acting, speaking, and teaching that construct race as important.  These practices include colorblindness, essentializing, and microaggression, as well as culturally responsive teaching, a positive racialized practice grounded in students' funds of knowledge and intended to counter more oppressive practices.Data sources included transcripts from semi-structured interviews, field notes from classroom and tutoring observations and various course and tutoring related artifacts such as the course syllabus, lesson plans, unit plans and written reflections.  Data were analyzed first, using a reflexive, constant comparative approach to gain insights into participants' rhetoric and actions.  Second, data were reconsidered to delineate racialized practices.The racialized practices of the preservice teachers involved in this literacy study were categorized as relationship-focused or instructionally-focused.  Although all participants enacted both positive and negative racialized practices, relationship-focused participants tended to exhibit qualitatively different practices compared to the instructionally-focused participants.  Regardless of their orientation, when participants shared their view of whether race mattered in education, the mostly White participants spoke predominantly of the significance of other people's races and not their own race.Racialized practices that were consistent with culturally-based pedagogies included intentionally nurturing relationships with students at the tutoring site, talking about ways to help students understand and negotiate the culture of power that is dominant in educational institutions including higher education and cautioning preservice peers that they need to be cognizant not to advance stereotypes.  Racialized practices that reflected participants' deficit thinking about their tutees, as well as their own discomfort in talking about racial issues included the enactments of racial microaggressions, distancing strategies and White talk.This study provides new insights into how preservice teachers' racialized practices shape and are shaped by the racial hierarchy that continues to exist in schools.  Findings have implications for school professionals, teacher educators and researchers who are interested in identifying and disrupting racialized literacy practices that may be harmful to students.  Additionally, this study suggests that further exploration is needed to understand how race is implicated in relationship-focused literacy teaching, content-focused literacy teaching and students' engagement in learning across the curriculum.?"
etd_13,"A Decent Place to Stay: Housing Crises, Failed Laws, and Property Conflicts in Washington, D.C",Geography,"homeless shelters, housing, property, public policy, urban development","In 1978 the District of Columbia City Council enacted a measure to tax up to 97 percent of the profits on speculative housing sales. In 1984 the District of Columbia voters approved an initiative to guarantee every resident who needed it access to overnight shelter for every night of the year. Both of these responses to the city's housing crisis marked the beginning of a politically progressive moment in Washington, D.C., when residents won the right to self-governance after a century of Congressional control and the majority-black electorate created a majority-black legislature of civil-right activists. But both laws were made to fail and overturned by the end of 1990. Based on roughly 10 months of archival research and interviews in Washington, D.C., this dissertation examines struggles to access, arrange, and govern residential space from the 1790s to the 1980s, paying particular attention to the last two decades of this period. This dissertation shows how struggles over housing rights in Washington, D.C. contributed to the reproduction of the hegemonic property regime even as the speculation tax and right to shelter contested some of the materialities, discourses, and practices within the socio-spatial order. I find that the intersections between property, racial equality, and democratic governance were central to struggles over urban development and were constituted in ways that hindered effective housing rights formation, enforcement, and protection. Throughout the study, I advance an analysis of the ways in which the social and spatial formation of places like Washington, D.C. are reproduced and challenged through struggles over housing."
etd_215,A Defense of Formal Contractualism,Philosophy,"Contractualism, Ethics, Moral Theory","Human dignity is arguably the most important value informing our moral practices.  Moral contractualism is appealing, in part, because it is a normative theory that tells us how to act in accordance with dignity or on the basis of mutual respect.  According to a popular account of contractualism, responding appropriately to the dignity of all persons requires acting in accordance with principles no one could reasonably reject.  I offer a comparative evaluation of two forms of contractualism - formal and substantive.  This evaluation offers a unique explanation of contractualism's understanding of moral normativity by examining the theory within a metanormative framework developed in the introduction.  I argue that formal contractualism is preferable because, unlike substantive contractualism, it offers a stronger vindication of morality.  However, I then argue that on closer inspection formal contractualism is unable to establish that all persons share dignity.  Since this would be detrimental to formal contractualism and since substantive contractualism faces its own problem, it looks like contractualism as a whole is in trouble.  I believe, however, that contractualism can be rescued.  I do this by revising the version of formal contractualism previously examined in a way that guarantees that equal dignity follows from its structure.According to contractualism, dignity ultimately grounds the moral reasons we have to do what is obligatory. However, forms of contractualism differ on a metanormative level depending on how they ultimately explain the force of our moral reasons.  Substantive contractualism explains this by appealing to substantive considerations the value of dignity offers, such as the consideration that we owe others justification for certain actions.  Formal contractualism explains this force by appealing to the formal structure of our moral practices rather than to substantive considerations or value.  The particular substantive contractualism I address is formulated by T. M. Scanlon.  The formal contractualism I discuss is developed by Stephen Darwall.Little work has been undertaken evaluating the adequacy of each form of contractualism.  Such an evaluation is important for two reasons.  First, while the normative principle of each form is almost identical the metanormative difference underwriting each may result in different moral judgments in our application of the principle.  Second, an important virtue of any theory of right is how well it can give a philosophical explanation of the moral reasons we have.  The strength of contractualism as a competing moral theory will depend in large part on how well it can give such an account.  Thus, it would behoove the contractualist to identify which form of contractualism offers the strongest explanation of moral reasons.  This will be a substantial part of my comparative evaluation.I begin by formulating two adequacy conditions any moral theory ought to meet.  The first is intensional adequacy: a theory is intensionally adequate to the extent that it does not conflict with the conceptual platitudes that characterize moral obligation.  The second is vindicatory adequacy:  here, a theory is adequate to the extent that it is able to give a philosophical explanation of the moral reasons we have.  I argue that unlike formal contractualism, substantive contractualism is unable to meet the vindicatory adequacy condition.  Therefore, formal contractualism is preferable.Although Darwallian formal contractualism is able to fulfill the vindicatory adequacy condition, it faces a separate challenge due to its formal approach.  This approach does not take the fact that all persons share equal dignity for granted.  Rather, it attempts to establish equal dignity - in the form of equal authority to hold each other accountable - by showing how it is a prerequisite of the practice of blame.  If successful, the formal approach, unlike the substantive approach, is able to offer an argument for why all persons share equal dignity.  This would be an additional advantage over the substantive approach.  However, Darwall's argument fails to establish that equal dignity is a prerequisite of blame.  Unless some other argument for equal dignity can be given, formal contractualism is threatened.We can rescue contractualism by modifying Darwall's account of blame.  I start by showing how this modified account is more attractive than Darwall's account.  I then employ speech-act theory in order to explicate the prerequisites of this account of blame.  By doing this, I am able to show that equal authority to hold accountable is a prerequisite of blame. If we grant that the practice of blaming is warranted, my argument successfully establishes that all persons share equal dignity thereby providing the needed foundation of formal contractualism and so rescuing contractualism as a whole."
etd_223,A Framework for Adoption of Challenges and Prizes in US Federal Agencies: A Study of Early Adopters,School of Information Studies,"challenge.gov, challenges and prizes, innovation, open innovation, organizational innovation","In recent years we have witnessed a shift in the innovation landscape of organizations from closed to more open models embracing solutions from the outside. Widespread use of the internet and web 2.0 technologies have made it easier for organizations to connect with their clients, service providers, and the public at large for more collaborative problem solving and innovation. Introduction of the Open Government initiative accompanied by the America Competes Reauthorization Act signaled an unprecedented commitment by the US Federal Government to stimulating more innovation and creativity in problem solving. The policy and legislation empowered agencies to open up their problem solving space beyond their regular pool of contractors in finding solutions to the nation's most complex problems.This is an exploratory study of the adoption of challenges as an organizational innovation in public sector organizations. The main objective is to understand and explain how, and under what conditions challenges are being used by federal agencies and departments as a tool to promote innovation. The organizational innovation literature provides the main theoretical foundation for this study, but does not directly address contextual aspects regarding the type of innovation and the type of organization. The guiding framework uses concepts drawn from three literature streams: organizational innovation, open innovation, and public sector innovation.Research was conducted using a qualitative case study of challenge.gov. Data was collected from multiple adopting agencies using two primary sources: interviews with challenge managers and administrators and, archival data from the challenge.gov web platform. Related documentation was used to supplement and corroborate the main data. Analysis of the platform archival data revealed four types of challenges falling along a continuum of increasing innovation. The sequence of events, activities and conditions leading to adoption and implementation were represented as a challenge adoption model. Variations among components of the model resulted in three distinct agency groupings represented as a typology of enactments characterized as inertia, application, and change. Thus challenge adoption among agencies with varying missions, operations and conditions leads to varying enactment types and different levels of change."
etd_668,A French Fort in the Salt City: Revisioning Sainte Marie among the Iroquois,Cultural Foundations of Education,"Collaboration, Museums, Native American, oral history, public history, public memory","This study examines the role museums play in constructing knowledge and public memory through a historical analysis of Sainte Marie de Gannentaha, a twentieth-century historic site commemorating a seventeenth-century Jesuit mission located on the shores of Onondaga Lake in Liverpool, New York. Liverpool is a suburb of Syracuse located in Onondaga County, the ancestral land of Onondagas, one of the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Onondaga Lake has been deeply sacred to the Haudenosaunee for more than a thousand years.Sainte Marie de Gannentaha opened in 1933, and was renamed Sainte Marie among the Iroquois Living History Museum in 1992. The county-owned facility closed in 2011 and was re-purposed as a Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) educational center known as Skä•noñh—The Great Law of Peace, which opened in 2015. A radical re-vision of the historical narrative occurred, shifting emphasis away from a colonial perspective to one that privileges Haudenosaunee oral history. The new story was a dynamic, theme-based narrative of Onondaga values and culture, past and present. The Onondaga people are at the heart of the new educational center, making this a unique international collaboration with Onondaga County. The message of the Skä•noñh Center reveals an urgency on behalf of the Onondaga Nation to raise awareness about Haudenosaunee cultural knowledge and values that benefit the global community, including contributions to American democracy, environmental protections, respect for natural resources, and civil rights.The purpose of this study is to trace Sainte Marie’s trajectory from a colonial historic site to its transition into a Haudenosaunee educational center. This is the first comprehensive study of Sainte Marie and the first academic study to discuss the Skä·noñh Center and the educational collaborative that created it. Grounded in critical museum theory, this study is supported by archival research, decolonizing methods, and oral history. My guiding research questions are: How has public memory shaped the past, and how does it challenge the Skä·noñh Center’s efforts to shift the narrative to a Haudenosaunee perspective? How does Skä·noñh’s educational model fit into the national/international discussion on representation, collaboration, and public memory in Indigenous museums? By firmly shifting education to the center, this study contributes a fresh perspective on museums as significant sites of informal learning, an area often overlooked in the education literature where studies of American public schools dominate the discourse."

The  primal-dual  interior  point  (PDIP) method  is state-of-the-art  algorithm for  solving linear  programs, and   can   be   decomposed   to   matrix-vector   multiplication   and solving   systems   of   linear   equations,   both   of   which   can   be conducted by the emerging memristor crossbar technique in O(1) time  complexity  in  the  analog  domain.

etd_586,"A Mediterranean Connection: French Ambassadors, the Republic of Venice, and the Construction of the Louisquatorzien State, 1662-1702",History,"Absolutism, Diplomacy, Louis XIV, Mediterranean, Seventeenth Century, Venice","Historians of Louis XIV’s reign have debated evolutions in the king’s administration. Such studies, despite heterogenous conclusions, better define our understanding of absolutist authority in the ancien régime as manifested through a process of so-called bureaucratic centralization. Scholars debate to what extent the monarchy achieved centralization amid the interests of individuals and corporations suspended in traditional hierarchies and socio-cultural expectations. Recently, scholars have posited that Louis’s government accommodated the concerns of its ministers through gratifications and social advancement compelling obedience to the Bourbon dynastic state. This dissertation considers for the first time how a politics of accommodation characterized the Crown’s rapport with a selection of diplomats in the years of Louis XIV’s personal rule.Specifically, I examine five ambassadors serving Louis XIV in the Republic of Venice. Focusing on French ambassadors in Venice accomplishes three tasks. First, ambassadors’ stories highlight how dynasticism perfused the personal ambitions of diplomats as much as it did those of the Crown. The dynastic imperative informed the choices of individuals within the diplomatic corps, and a desire to advance personal fortune and family honor fueled their participation in Louis’s foreign ministry. Secondly, diplomats’ correspondence from Venice elucidates French politics with Venice, other Italian states, and within the commercial and maritime spheres of the Mediterranean Sea. I consider how centralization facilitated or impeded Louis’s hegemonic strategies in Italy and in the sea. Finally, I argue that the Venetians maintained diplomatic relevance for the French until 1702. Traditional narratives claim that Venice “declined” on the international stage by the mid-seventeenth century, but I underscore that Louis XIV viewed Venice as a robust polity critical to the success of dynastic politics throughout most of his reign."
etd_526,A Modular Approach to Highly Functionalized Indole Derivatives and Syntheses of Tryptamine-based SHIP Inhibitors,Chemistry,"Indole, pyrroloindoline, SHIP, Trichloroacetimidates, Tryptamine","Indole scaffolds are incorporated in a plethora of clinically useful natural products like ergotamine, reserpine, vincristine. Indole alkaloids have been fascinating chemists and biologists alike because of its diverse biological activity and intrinsic structural complexity. N-alkylated tryptamines, along with their analogs, are recognized as potent SHIP inhibitors and are considered privileged structures due their binding properties and diverse biological targeting. Also, the pyrrolo[2,3-a]indoline frameworks have been recognized as key structural motifs in many anticancer and psychoactive compounds. Thus, the development of a simple, inexpensive, efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly method of accomplishing indole alkylation constitutes an important synthetic goal. This dissertation describes modular approaches to constructing densely functionalized indoles, fused heteroaromatic natural products and alkylated tryptamines.The first chapter of the dissertation gives a detailed account of reactions of glycosyl or alkyl trichloroacetimidates with various indole derivatives substituted at N-, 2- and 3- position. While Friedel Crafts reactions of indoles with trichloroacetimidates are known, regioselectivity of these reactions is not very clear. The relative utility of all the known reactions is reviewed in order to gauge the potential of this new technology.Trichloroacetimidates make excellent electrophiles when activated with Brønsted or Lewis acids, and therefore were good substrates for the elaboration of the nucleophilic indole heterocycle. Intriguingly, the primary product of these transformations depends on both the structure of the imidate and the indole nucleophile, with N-alkylation, C2-alkylation, and C3-alkylation products being readily attainable. This transformation is discussed in the second chapter. By exploring modular approaches to constructing these compounds, we envision that this methodology will aid the preparation of densely functionalized tryptamines.Dearomatization reaction is a powerful tool that converts planar aromatic compounds into interesting highly functionalized three-dimensional structures. The reactions discussed herein include the alkylative dearomatization through activation of trichloroacetimidates for the syntheses of 2,3,3’-trisubstituted indolenine cores. Dearomatization / Cyclization cascade sequences that involve dearomatization as the key step useful in the syntheses of pyrrolo[2,3-a]indoline frameworks are also described in the third chapter.Phosphatidylinositol 3’-kinase (PI3K) is an important component of an important signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth and cell proliferation. The SH2 containing inositol 5'-phosphatase (SHIP) also plays a regulatory role in the PI3K signaling pathway. Inhibition of SHIP using small molecules has been shown to result in decreased cell growth in a number of cancer cell lines. Thus, SHIP inhibitors are being investigated as potential anti-cancer drugs. In this chapter, synthesis of a tryptaimine based SHIP inhibitor and some analogs is discussed.Fifth chapter discusses protection of carboxylic acids converted to the corresponding 4-methoxybenzyl (PMB) esters with 4-methoxybenzyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate in the absence of an acid catalyst.  This operationally simple procedure is an effective method for the formation of PMB esters.  The reaction is promoted by the carboxylic acids themselves in excellent yields (78-99%).  No racemization is observed in the case of carboxylic acids bearing a ?-stereocenter."

School counselors are in a unique position to act as advocates for students with disabilities and their families to ensure that they have the educational and community supports they need for healthy academic, career, and personal/social development. Unfortunately, the professional school counseling literature highlights that school counselors are not adequately trained to effectively engage with students with disabilities. This study explored the predictive factors that may play an influential role in the engagement of school counselors in school counseling activities with students with disabilities. Variables explored included number of students with disabilities on current school counselor caseload, quality of contact with individuals with disabilities, graduate education in disability, attitudes towards individuals with disabilities, feelings of preparedness to engage students with disabilities, and school counselor cognitive complexity. Path analysis and exploratory factor analysis were used to examine the influence of these variables on school counselor engagement with students with disabilities. Implications for school counselor educators, and future avenues of research are discussed."

This dissertation explores that tension within the context of the undergraduate Writing major. I begin by reviewing scholarship about advanced composition, advanced Writing, and the Writing major. I read this literature in light of concerns about student subjectivity, authorship, and disciplinary participation. Through that reading, I explore the conflicted status of the student subject imagined within this literature. The subject I discern contains elements of what Susan Miller describes as the normative subject of composition as well as elements of a revised and politically astute Writing Studies. In chapter two, I demonstrate how these elements also appeared in the discourse of students who participated in the two-institution study of undergraduate Writing majors upon which the remaining chapters of this dissertation are based. In chapter three, I argue that when students articulated the work of the Writing major, they privileged relational, affective labor in ways that may potentially affirm arguments for the Writing major as a vehicle for disciplinarity as well as assert pedagogy's continued importance within Writing Studies even as its practitioners pursue academic professionalization. Chapter four examines students' discourse and their writing for scholarly, professional, and civic purposes in order to demonstrate how students contribute to-- and participate in--goals widely held within Writing Studies through academic, creative, and creative nonfiction forms. In the fifth and concluding chapter, I consider the implications of this research for scholarly writing practice and for writing pedagogy. I also acknowledge the limitations of this current project and outline an agenda for future research. Ultimately, this dissertation encourages a broad understanding of students' disciplinary contribution and participation."

The objective of my study was to identify key variables found within military cultural environments that potentiated the possibility of suicidal behavior.  Path analysis was used to determine possible military cultural factors that may influence a clinical suicidal assessment in veterans post-deployment.  This study sequentially randomly examined 151 post-deployed OEF/OIF/OND veteran surveys via the OEF/OIF/OND Post-Deployment VA Screening tool for post-deployment challenges.   Hypothesis 1: Higher affinity to military culture post-deployment as defined through the three transitional factors of reintegration would lead to increased post-deployment suicidal gestures.  This research initially proposed three transitional factors of reintegration that worked in tandem to create a more synergistic model of post-deployment reintegration, military-related suicidal descriptors, and markers that indicated a challenging or successful reintegration from post-deployed military life to civilian life (Dirkzwager et al., 2005; Figley, 2005; Margolin et al., 2005; Resnik et al., 2011; Taft et al., 2008).   Three factors were developed through variables that were associated with the factor name:  military stressors, coping and suicidal gestures.  Hypothesis 2: Veterans who reported increased stressors with reintegration would be more likely to have higher assessment scores and be at higher risk for suicidal gestures.   Results supported the hypothesis of military culture influencing factors of reintegration.  The three-factors were military stressors, coping and suicide. This research further demonstrated a positive correlation between military cultural factors remaining after deployment and the veterans' ability to transition into civilian communities.   This research generated an increased understanding of military culture and the transitional process from active duty to civilian life that may hold the key to a more predictive understanding of suicide and suicidal behaviors in the United States OEF/OIF/OND veteran population."
etd_229,A Phenomenological Study of Factors that Influence Project Manager Efficacy: The Role of Soft Skills and Hard Skills in IT-Centric Project Environments,School of Information Studies,"Information Management, Information Sciences, Information Technology, Project Management, Project Manager, Project Success","One source of confusion around the factors that influence project manager efficacy already identified in the literature is the lack of clear agreement on definitions of success as viewed by different stakeholders in the context of project success, project management success, and project manager success. These are not subtle differences when making decisions related to hiring, professional development efforts, and curriculum development. The purpose of this phenomenological research was to identify what Senior IT Leaders and Certified Project Management Professionals (PMPs) identify as the most important attributes for project manager efficacy as it relates to project success. The first sub-question is whether there are differences in expectations between Senior IT Leaders who hire, assign, and develop their project managers, and Certified Project Management Professionals who execute projects. The second sub-question is whether contextual factors such as industry or organizational culture affect stakeholder skill rankings. The final sub-question is whether new project management modalities such as agile create different demands on project managers, resulting in new or changing perceptions of necessary skills and knowledge for project manager efficacy. Using a comparative focus group design with participants from three industry sectors, this study provides clear evidence of the factors these two stakeholder groups consider the most important contributors to project manager efficacy as it relates to project success and application of project management tools/knowledge. Contributions of findings extend beyond providing a list of skills project managers must acquire by providing a deeper understanding of priorities and contextual influences on perceived value in three categories; 1. IT knowledge and skills, 2. Interpersonal skills and 3. Project management methodology knowledge and application. The key lessons learned from this thesis research contribute to the overall body of knowledge in IT project management, as well as to practice. Key Finding 1: There is a clear skill category preference for project managers in an IT-centric project environment for both stakeholder groups, adding to our understanding of the potential conflicts and agreements between hiring, delegating or development managers and project managers. Key Finding 2: The skill category priorities related to factors that contribute to project success and attributes that contribute to project manager efficacy strengthened through collaborative discussion with peers, suggesting that research methods need to engage participants. Key Finding 3: Four specific attribute categories emerged as most important for project manager efficacy: facilitation skills, communication skills, leadership skills, and individual personality traits. Key Finding 4: While Senior IT Leaders considered IT knowledge and skills as ""moderately important"" contributors to project success, descriptions suggested a preference for general, or basic, IT knowledge rather than a specialized area of IT expertise. This finding may influence practitioners' decisions on resource allocation for project manager development. Key Finding 5: There were suggestions of industry influences on attributes influencing project manager efficacy during the initial group brainstorming. However, stakeholders did not include those attributes that varied between industries when ranking attributes in order of perceived importance, adding support for a group of key attributes that are expected of project managers for them to be effective across industries. Key Finding 6:  Similarly, while the participants' suggest project manager efficacy is situational; this did not influence their skill category rankings or attributes most important for project manager efficacy. This reinforces support for key attributes of effective project managers. Key Finding 7: Agile project management approaches do create a different demand on project managers; however, participants were unanimous in their assertion that the attributes most important for project manager efficacy do not change in an agile project management environment. This is an important finding as it contradicts early anecdotal evidence. Each of these findings contribute to the body of research on project manager success, project success and project management success, as well as providing insights for practice and new thoughts for future research."

This current investigation utilized Bronfenbrenner’s Bioecological Theory as a means with which to structure both the interviews with the informants as well as the findings. I also utilized Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis as the means of gathering, interpreting, and presenting the data in a meaningful way. The participants engaged in a range of interpersonal and context dependent strategies in an effort to manage the real, perceived, or anticipated reactions to their identities. Careful disclosure of their identities appears to have minimized rejection, as well as incidents of bullying, and was implemented with the goal of maintaining a sense of connectedness to the relationships and contexts most relevant to their development. A positive experience following the disclosure of their sexual or gender identities was associated with a sense of connectedness and a reduction in incidents of self-harm or social isolation in one or more relationships or contexts."
etd_436,A Quantitative Assessment and Comparison of Conceptual Learning in Online and Classroom-Instructed Anatomy and Physiology,Science Teaching,"anatomy and physiology, ANCOVA, online learning, online science course, predictors of online success, web-based teaching","Online and virtual technologies have allowed higher education institutions to expand educational opportunities to a broader range of students. The number of students enrolling in online courses is rapidly accelerating, and therefore performance-based evidence of the effectiveness and equivalence of such courses to enhance student learning is necessary, especially in lab-based science courses – where research is currently lacking. This study compared conceptual learning of online and on-campus students in a two-semester anatomy and physiology course sequence. Two terms of students (N=397) completed standardized pre-test and post-test assessments designed to assess content knowledge and conceptual learning based on change scores before and after the intervention. Descriptive statistics were calculated to provide information on the background and equivalency of the groups with respect to certain learner variables, and a multiple regression model was used to assess the influence of learner variables on the knowledge-based assessment outcomes. The analysis showed that GPA significantly predicted performance on the learning assessment for the online treatment group, and GPA and the number of employment hours significantly predicted performance on the learning assessment for the on-campus control group. An Analysis of Covariance was used to examine the effect of course modality on learning. Both online and on-campus participants significantly improved their performance on the post-test, and there were no significant differences in learning gains between the groups. The results of this study suggest, and support previous research regarding online learning, that both online and on-campus instructional modalities can achieve the same conceptual learning goals in anatomy and physiology. The results of this study can be used to inform the ways in which learning in online anatomy and physiology courses parallels that of its physical on-campus counterpart, and prompt further research in this area. One of the most salient consequences of the present findings is the potential implications for higher education institutions regarding research, support, and transfer of online courses in the natural sciences, and further exploration of the potentials of such courses to attract and retain students."
idde_etd_59,A Relationship between Course-level Implementation of First Principles of Instruction and Cognitive Engagement: A Multilevel Analysis,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Cognitive Engagement, Cognitive Strategy, First Principles of Instruction, Goal Orientation, Multilevel Mediation Model, Self-regulated Strategy","Cognitive engagement is an indicator of how students engage in their learning process in classroom context, and the levels of cognitive engagement are conceptualized by the use of cognitive and metacognitive strategies. As the levels of cognitive engagement are thought to be a result of interactions between students and learning contexts, previous studies have explored how certain practices within a course promote student cognitive engagement, but placed less emphasis on the integration of instructional design principles. Given the theoretical and practical importance of First Principles of Instruction, this dissertation answers the question of whether the degree to which the First Principles are implemented in courses makes a difference in students' cognitive engagement when taking into account the mediating role of individual goals, another key predictor of cognitive engagement. A multilevel mediation analysis demonstrates that the influences of course-level implementation of First Principles are transmitted to cognitive engagement through individual intrinsic goal orientation. The implementation of First Principles affects students' deep cognitive strategy use directly as well as indirectly through intrinsic goal orientation. The effect of the First Principles on surface strategy use and self-regulated strategy use appears to be mediated by intrinsic goal orientations. The dissertation concludes that students in a course with greater implementation of First Principles are interested in learning and mastery of academic materials, and ultimately are likely to become engaged in learning in cognitive and self-regulated fashion."

I structured seven ordinal outcome variables regarding professional development and placed them into an antecedent direct-effects model theoretical framework.  I operationalized Hallinger's (2011b) conceptually-based leadership for learning model into three domains: the contexts for leadership (antecedents); leadership focus, and sharing leadership (changes/differences as outcomes). Through this study I attempted to determine if educational policies and contexts at the state, district, and school levels have affected principal leadership behaviors regarding professional development and school goal-setting, district goal-setting, standards, student achievement, teachers' planning of professional development, teachers' presentation of professional development, and supporting professional development with resources.  I also attempted to determine if groups of principals working in different professional contexts (accountability level, geographic location, socioeconomic status, grade-level) enacted changes in practice or increased influence over professional development activities during the implementation of NCLB between 1999-2007.The study results show principals' increased influence and control over the planning and presentation of professional development as a result of NCLB implementation across all settings, reducing teachers' participation and collaboration with leadership in these areas.  Principals also increased control and alignment of professional development and school goals, student achievement, and supporting professional development with resources.  Results also show principals working in urban, elementary, low-SES, and high minority school contexts are more likely to include teachers in the planning and presentation of professional development, but are also more likely to direct and align professional development with school and district goals, standards, student achievement outcomes, and resources.  I discuss the potential implications for educational leadership research, practice, and principal preparation."
phy_etd_129,A Search for WIMP Dark Matter using an Optimized Chi-square Technique on the Final Data from the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Experiment (CDMS II).,Physics,Experimental Cosmology,"During the last two decades, cosmology has become a precision observational science thanks (in part) to the incredible number of experiments performed to better understand the composition of the universe. The large amount of data accumulated strongly indicates that the bulk of the universe’s matter is in the form of nonbaryonic matter that does not interact electromagnetically. Combined evidence from the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters confirms that most of the mass in the universe is not composed of any known form of matter. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background, big bang nucleosynthesis and many other experiments indicate that ? 80% of the matter in the universe is dark, non-relativistic and cold. The dark matter resides in the halos surrounding galaxies, galaxy clusters and other large-scale structures.Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are well motivated class of dark matter candidates that arise naturally in supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model of particles physics, and can be produced as non-relativistic thermal relics in the early universe with about the right density to account for the missing mass. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment seeks to directly detect the keV-scale energy deposited by WIMPs in the galactic halo when they scatter from nuclei in the crystalline detectors made of germanium and silicon. These detectors, called Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon detectors (ZIPs) are operated at ? 45 mK and simultaneously measure the ionization and the (athermal) phonons produced by particle interactions. The ratio of ionization and phonon energies allows discrimination of a low rate of nuclear recoils (expected for WIMPs) from an overwhelming rate of electron recoils (expected for most backgrounds). Phonon-pulse shape and timing enables further suppression of lower-rate interactions at the detector surfaces.This dissertation describes the results of a WIMP search using CDMS II data sets accumulated at the Soudan Underground Laboratory in Minnesota. Results from the original analysis of these data were published in 2009; two events were observed in the signal region with an expected leakage of 0.9 events. Further investigation revealed an issue with the ionization-pulse reconstruction algorithm leading to a software upgrade and a subsequent reanalysis of the data. As part of the reanalysis, I performed an advanced discrimination technique to better distinguish (potential) signal events from backgrounds using a 5-dimensional chi-square method. This data analysis technique combines the event information recorded for each WIMP-search event to derive a background-discrimination parameter capable of reducing the expected background to less than one event, while maintaining high efficiency for signal events. Furthermore, optimizing the cut positions of this 5-dimensional chi-square parameter for the 14 viable germanium detectors yields an improved expected sensitivity to WIMP interactions relative to previous CDMS results. This dissertation describes my improved (and optimized) discrimination technique and the results obtained from a blind application to the reanalyzed CDMS II WIMP-search data.This analysis achieved the best expected sensitivity of the three techniques developed for the reanalysis and so was chosen as the primary timing analysis whose limit will be quoted in a on-going publication paper which is currently in preparation. For this analysis, a total raw exposure of 612.17 kg-days are analyzed for this work. No candidate events were observed, and a corresponding upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of WIMP mass is defined. These data set a 90% upper limit on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic-scattering cross section of 3.19 × 10 ?44 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 60 GeV/c2. Combining this result with all previous CDMS II data gives an upper limit of 1.96×10 ?44 cm2 for a WIMP of mass 60 GeV/c2 (a factor of 2 better than the original analysis).At the moment this analysis is being written, the WIMP-search results obtained with the reanalyzed CDMS II data occupies the second most stringent limits on WIMP-nucleon scattering, after XENON100, excluding previously unexplored parameter space. Interesting parameter space is excluded for WIMP-nucleon cross section as function of WIMP masse under standard assumptions, the parameter space favored by interpretations of other experiments’s data as low-mass WIMP signals due to an excess of low energy events and annual modulation is partially excluded for DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT."
etd_272,A Semantics and Context -Aware Approach to Android Application Security,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Android, App description, Malware detection, Privacy leakage, Security, Vulnerability patching","As usage of the Android applications has grown, security concerns have also increased.Four major threats have attracted attention. Malicious apps have been increasingly exponentially. Android Malware steals and pollutes sensitive information, executes attacker specified commands, or even totally roots and subverts the mobile devices. Moreover, a significant amount of recently discoveredmalware samples are polymorphic malware variants and zero-day malware. New malware instances can easily exercise bytecode-level obfuscation to evade existing AV scanners.A broad spectrum of software vulnerabilities have been discovered in Android apps. Attackers can exploit vulnerable programs to launch various attacks on their behalf. Static analysis is used to detect vulnerabilities, but introduces significant false alarms. An automated technique is needed to efficiently patch the victim apps and precisely defeat exploitations.Information leakage is prevailing in both malware and benign applications. Some information leaks are legitimate due to the essential app functionalities, whereas others are undesirable or even malicious. It is thus extremely difficult to accurately and efficiently track information leaks, and at the same time, effectively disable the undesired ones.The textual description of app products in Android markets act as the frontline protection and help users to recognize malicious or unwanted programs. Thus, the fact that Android app descriptions cannot faithfully reflect the security risks imperils end users.Android permissions are not only hard to understand but also incapable of explaining how the requested permissions are used. Textual descriptions provided by developers are not security-centric or trustworthy.This dissertation addresses these problems by presenting concepts, methods and techniques that can be used to robustly detect malware, automatically patch vulnerabilities, efficiently protect privacy and effectively help users to understand the risks of mobile apps.Firstly, DroidSIFT is proposed and developed to perform semantics-aware Android malware detection and classification. It extracts high-level program behavior graphs as features and captures homogeneous behaviors via measuring graph similarities. Thus, the subsequent classification is resilient to bytecode-level obfuscation and can detect malware variants and zero-day malware.Secondly, AppSealer is presented to automatically patch component hijacking vulnerabilities in Android programs. It selectively inserts patch code into vulnerable programs and monitors the exact program slices that lead to potential exploitations. The patch code only introduces necessary intervention when an attack is about to launch. Therefore, this patch-based solution has minimal impact on the usability, but gains time for the developers to bring the fundamental fix.Thirdly, Capper is introduced to enforce context-aware privacy policies for Android apps without compromising legitimate functionalities. It rewrites privacy breaching apps by inserting code that tracks sensitive information flow and enforces privacy polices. The policies are specific to program contexts and are created via modeling the user reaction to each privacy incident at runtime.Lastly, DescribeMe is proposed and developed to automatically generate security-centric descriptions for Android applications. It retrieves security-related program semantics from Android apps and translates them into natural language scripts. To facilitate the translation, it also performs frequent behavior mining to discover and compress common semantics. As a result, the produced descriptions are security-sensitive, human-understandable and concise."
etd_136,A Social History of the New York City Trans Fat Policy,Social Sciences,"chronic disease, citizenship, consumers, food movements, sociology of science, trans fatty acids","In December 2006, the New York City Board of Health passed an ordinance introduced by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to amend the Health Code and restrict the amount of artificial trans fatty acids served in restaurant foods. Artificial trans fats, generated during the process of partial hydrogenation of oils, were ubiquitous in refined, convenience, and fast foods and implicated in heart disease and other health concerns. As one of a patchwork of local policies aimed at addressing a gap in federal labeling laws, the New York City ordinance generated heated debate but ultimately succeeded and influenced other policies across the globe. The policy targeted a food additive to address growing concern for food-related chronic disease in public health. The safety of artificial trans fat had long been questioned, but the fat remained in the food supply for decades, aided by intractable scientific debate and industry influence. In the 1990s, new studies confirmed the danger of artificial trans fats. It was not until consumers embraced the new science and became active that artificial trans fats emerged as a public policy issue. As uniquely powerful public health entities, the New York City Board of Health and Department of Health and Mental Hygiene provided a platform that engaged consumers in transformational policy change. This dissertation used interview and archival data to show how consumer activism influenced the New York City artificial trans fat policy and affirmed the emerging scientific knowledge of the fat as a dangerous additive. Consumers applied diffuse and diverse forms of individual and collective activism to support regulation and elimination of the fat. They refused to purchase products that contained artificial trans fats using every day forms of science and political engagement, like reading labels, to support their social values for health, a transparent food supply, and consumer choice. Evidence from this social history shows consumers followed a U.S. tradition of consumer citizenship. It also illustrates how consumer activism serves as an important and powerful balance to the economic interests of industry."

Data used in this study were from High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. Intersectional approaches were employed to gain an in-depth understanding of student characteristics, as well as identify potential differences in students’ STEM behaviors. Further, examinations of the STEM career development process were conducted using structural equation modeling statistical techniques. Findings suggest that prior learning experiences (i.e., math aptitude, informal STEM learning experiences, and math and science identity) and environmental supports and barriers (e.g., informal STEM exposure) are significant influences on students’ STEM career development. Additionally, when considering the entire student population, students’ math and science self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and interest are significant predictors of STEM career intentions and STEM major selection. However, multi-group structural equation modeling analyses, particularly with regard to race/ethnicity and socio-economic status, indicate substantial between group differences in students’ STEM career development. When examining race, the proposed model was most predictive for White students and least predictive for Black students. STEM career intention was significantly influenced by math interest and math outcome expectation for White and Asian students, but these factors were not predictive for Latino and Black students. Additionally, self-efficacy was predictive of STEM major selection for all racial/ethnic groups, except Black students. Finally, outcome expectation was shown to significantly influence STEM major selection for White students, but not for any of the other racial/ethnic groups. Similar trends emerged when analyzing the proposed model by students’ socio-economic status—the model was most predictive of STEM career development for students in the highest socio-economic quintiles, and least predictive for those in the lowest."
etd_179,A STUDY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF  ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES OVER IMPERFECT GROUND PLANES  BASED ON SCHELKUNOFF INTEGRALS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Green's Function, Imperfect Ground Planes, Schelkunoff Integrals, Sommerfeld Integrals, Surface Waves","A new formulation for the analysis of propagation of electromagnetic waves over imperfectly conducting planar surfaces is proposed. The classical approach for the analysis of this problem uses the Sommerfeld formulation. In Sommerfeld formulation, the wave function corresponding to a point source is expanded in terms of the propagation constants of the various waves in the radial direction from the source. This gives rise to the well-known Sommerfeld integrals which are highly oscillatory and slowly-decaying in nature, especially when the source is mounted just on top of a planar boundary between two media of arbitrary conductivity. In addition, the nature of the convergence for these integrals is extremely slow and may not yield stable results. In this dissertation we present an approach, developed originally by Schelkunoff, which expands the wave function in terms of the waves emanating perpendicular to the planar interface, not parallel to it as in Sommerfeld formulation. Expressions are given for both cases of vertical and horizontal electric dipoles on top of a planar interface. The debatable nature of this problem is unavoidable, thus a detailed analytical comparison between the Sommerfeld integrals and the expressions derived here is given. Based on the study given in this dissertation, the true rationale in relating the work of Zenneck and Sommerfeld to the relatively new field of surface plasmons is exposed. A detailed literature study as well as an analytical critique of the field of plasmonics and its relation to Sommerfeld-Zenneck surface waves is presented. Finally, some applications of the new formulation are discussed using numerical simulations."
etd_248,A STUDY OF CERTAIN ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTIONS AMONG HIGH OPTICAL CONDUCTIVITY NANOSPHERES AND DIELECTRIC HALF-SPACES,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"Electromagnetic coupling between a sphere and a semi-infinite substrate, and among several spheres present in the form of a composite were studied in this dissertation. Specifically, spheres made of noble metals such as Ag, Au and Cu and relatively high refractive index substrates and composite matrices. Such interactions need to be studied in order to understand and be able to design better devices such as plasmonic light devices as well as composites and fluids that have suspended plasmonic nanoparticles that have recently been shown to be technologically relevant in the context of device processing technologies and fluidic devices. For a sphere present near a relatively high refractive index substrate, coupling effects were found to significantly change the value of the induced electric dipole moment. It was found that the radiated power had a very strong dependence on the distance between the sphere and the substrate as well as the polarization and the angle of the incident plane wave. The wavelength dependence was also found to change significantly allowing access to regions of relatively larger values of the wavelength for the same material system and incident field as well as wavelength selective amplification of the response. The linear response of plasmonic composites was studied using an effective medium approximation. The effective permittivity was calculated using an effective medium model that was sensitive to a random composite's radial distribution function. The effect of the size of the monodisperse spheres, their volume fraction and material constituents were studied. A strong dependence on the microstructure was found for composites made of a relatively large refractive index matrix."

This innovative policy mandates that trauma centers use the `teachable moment' generated by traumatic injury as a gateway to effective prevention of future alcohol abuse and other alcohol-related consequences.Researchers have decried the lack of investigation regarding the ""how and why"" (Nilsen et al., 2008, p. 200) of brief intervention effects. The overall aim of the current study was to better understand the nature and possible active ingredients of the screening and brief intervention encounter. Specifically, this inquiry focused upon the effect of patient-level variables and two distinct brief motivational interviewing-based counseling interventions on patient engagement and on six-month drinking outcomes.There were two primary findings of this study. One, that a new standardized brief counseling intervention interview exploring 1) the patient's reasons for seeking drunken states and 2) alternative coping strategies for healthier functioning appeared to be as efficacious as a widely-used brief intervention focusing upon quantity and frequency of drinking. Two, that patient pre-intervention AUDIT scores were a major predictor of changes in patient AUDIT scores at 6 months post-intervention in a way that was theoretically counter-intuitive: namely, that high scores (indicating possible alcohol dependence) were associated with the greatest changes at follow-up. The patient engagement variable did not emerge as a significant predictor or moderator of outcomes. Limitations and implications of findings are discussed. Future investigation of the construct of patient engagement is recommended."

More recently, that rivalry has often been expressed by means of bullets and bombs, especially in Pakistan. But beyond the headline-grabbing violence of the Deobandi-Barelvi schism lies the story of a century-and-a-half-long religious antagonism: at first over converts, later for competing visions of the political future, then for a place within a new ""Islamic"" polity--for dominance within its political structure.

Mexico ranks third worldwide, surpassed only by Italy (16) and Spain (12), with ten World Heritage cities, an accomplishment frequently touted in official rhetoric and tourism promotion. This dissertation seeks to shed light on the ""World Heritage experience;"" the designation history, what occurs after the designation, in relation to long-term planning, investment, and how do local, state, and federal government infrastructure cope with the pressures and obligations of preservation. Drawing on newspapers, official government reports, and interviews with officials, civil servants, and tour guides, I address the following research questions:What is behind the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designation process, and what does it entail? How has Mexico protected its heritage? How have the cities of Guanajuato, Morelia, and Oaxaca specifically achieved the World Heritage designation and how have they continued to preserve and manage their historic centers? What planning and legislative measures have they taken to aid preservation? And how, if at all, does World Heritage figure in tourism promotion?My research reveals a politicized UNESCO designation process, little continuity and limited actual implementation of planning tools in aid of preservation, short political cycles and lack of institutional memory, frequent large-scale public works in the historic centers that often seem to duplicate efforts, sporadic and patchy public participation, with the exception of deliberate obsolescence as far as private property was concerned, uneven application of legislation and regulation, and tourism promotion simply for the sake of promotion."
it_etd_69,A Temporal Model of Mindful Interactions Around New Service Conception,Information Science and Technology,"Grounded Theory, Library Innovation, Mindfulness, New Service Conception, Service Innovation","The organizational ability to innovate is widely acknowledged as crucial to sustained success. For libraries and other service providers, innovation entails the continuous development of new services that propose value to customers. This new service development process can be understood as comprising a ""front end,"" in which new service ideas are conceived and developed, and a ""back end,"" in which selected ideas are implemented. Our understanding of the former - that is, of new service conception in libraries - is particularly underdeveloped.To build a conceptual foundation for research in this area I used qualitative data collection techniques and constant-comparison analysis within the framework of a comparative, embedded case study. Fourteen new service ideas conceived by three case organizations - two public library systems and one library consortium - served as the units of analysis. The model that emerged from the data - a ""Temporal Model of Mindful Interactions Around New Service Conception"" - depicts library administrators as active producers of new service concepts. More specifically, the model posits that the innovative library administrator continuously identifies new customer needs and new external solutions through seven types of mindful interactions. At the same time, she tries to match unmet customer needs with potential external solutions in order to produce a new service concept that is ready for implementation.The model extends the concept of individual mindfulness as developed by Weick and Sutcliffe (2006) and Weick and Putnam (2006). In short, it proposes that an individual can concurrently maintain two modes of mindfulness - cognitive-flow mindfulness and content mindfulness - in order to facilitate knowledge creation in the form of a new service concept. More specifically, one can be mindful during an interaction of its potential for engendering novel content (cognitive-flow mindfulness) while keeping in mind certain organizationally-influenced content (content mindfulness). The individual who can concurrently maintain both modes of mindfulness is better able to make novel associations between new information and the content about which she is mindful (e.g., the library's mission and major goals, unmet customer needs, potential external solutions).While the data behind the model suggest that mindfulness can be maintained by admini-strators in smaller, more resource-challenged libraries, and in libraries with non-consolidated organizational structures, the data also reveal that the new service concepts produced by these administrators were yielded only after an external funding source was obtained. For these libraries, developing and delivering new services without grant monies, or without a mechanism within the service for generating revenue, may not be feasible. This does not mean that the administrators of these libraries should stop trying to innovate, or should stop being mindful of new service possibilities, but rather that (1) they must be mindful, perhaps to a greater degree than their counterparts at better-funded libraries, of an interaction's potential for engendering an external funding source, and (2) they may not be able to devote as much time to identifying new customer needs and potential external solutions. Instead, they may need to devote much of their time to addressing ongoing financial challenges."
it_etd_77,A Theory of ICT User Types: Exploring Domestication and Meaning of ICTS through Comparative Case Studies,Information Science and Technology,"domestication theory, gerontechnology, ICTs, older adults, seniors, technology","The population in the United States is aging, with a predicted 147% increase in the number of older adults (those over age 65) from 2000- 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). At the same time, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are increasingly being used in work, leisure, and government. Despite these two trends towards an aging population and greater ICT use, very little is known about if and how older adults are using ICTs in their everyday lives (Birkland & Kaarst-Brown, 2011). Despite many calls for researchers to take a wider perspective (Bouwhuis, 2006; van Bronswijk, et al., 2009), most studies have concentrated on assistive devices or examining the care of older adults with health issues. In order to understand how older adults were using ICTs in their daily lives this study used a comparative case methodology of 17 cases, with each case consisting of an older adult and several members of their social network. Using domestication theory (Silverstone, 1994) and an interpretive interactionism approach (Denzin, 2001), this series of comparative case studies discovered five distinct domestication patterns. These domestication patterns, or user types, differ in how these users were introduced to, use, display, and the meaning they attribute to ICTs in their everyday lives."
etd_235,A Unified And Green Platform For Smartphone Sensing,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"lifestyle, mobile phone sensing, ranking, scheduling, sensing platform, smartphone sensing","Smartphones have become key communication and entertainment devices in people's daily life. Sensors on (or attached to) smartphones can enable attractive sensing applications in different domains, including environmental monitoring, social networking, healthcare, transportation, etc. Most existing smartphone sensing systems are application-specific. How to leverage smartphones' sensing capability to make them become unified information providers for various applications has not yet been fully explored. This dissertation presents a unified and green platform for smartphone sensing, which has the following desirable features: 1) It can support various smartphone sensing applications; 2) It is personalizable; 2) It is energy-efficient; and 3) It can be easily extended to support new sensors.  Two novel sensing applications are built and integrated into this unified platform: SOR and LIPS. SOR is a smartphone Sensing based Objective Ranking (SOR) system. Different from a few subjective online review and recommendation systems (such as Yelp and TripAdvisor), SOR ranks a target place based on data collected via smartphone sensing. LIPS is a system that learns the LIfestyles of mobile users via smartPhone Sensing (LIPS). Combining both unsupervised and supervised learning, a hybrid scheme is proposed to characterize lifestyle and predict future activities of mobile users. This dissertation also studies how to use the cloud as a coordinator to assist smartphones for sensing collaboratively with the objective of reducing sensing energy consumption. A novel probabilistic model is built to address the GPS-less energy-efficient crowd sensing problem. Provably-good approximation algorithms are presented to enable smartphones to sense collaboratively without accurate locations such that sensing coverage requirements can be met with limited energy consumption."

It explains processes of urban regulation, juxtaposing the (re)production and representation of Ladakhi architectural heritage both during the conservation of historical buildings and during the construction of new tourist accommodations.   Qualitative ethnographic research and spatial studies were conducted to investigate how competing discourses on Ladakhi heritage generated by state-based tourism industries and by non-governmental organizations are shaping building traditions, residence patterns, and livelihoods for resident Ladakhis. Leh's built environment is a product of numerous contestations and negotiations between residents, NGOs and the state in places I call heritage construction sites: architectural conservation projects and new guest-house construction projects, respectively. In this study, I pinpoint how Ladakhis identify with or contest the transformation of their urban landscape, answering the question ""whose heritage is it?"""
socsci_etd_180,Achieving Justice Through Public Participation: Measuring the Effectiveness of New York's Enhanced Public Participation Plan for Environmental Justice Communities,Social Sciences,"administrative decision-making, environmental justice, environmental policy, procedural justice, public participation, recognition","Public participation is at the heart of democracy and of the environmental justice movement. Most state-level environmental justice policies and regulations focus on improving public participation within administrative processes to ensure that communities have a voice in the environmental decisions that affect them. New York has adopted an environmental justice policy that follows this model and requires enhanced notice, accessible comment opportunities, and improved access to technical information for new major environmental permits issued to facilities proposed in low-income or minority communities. However, New York's policy, like other state participation-focused environmental justice policies, has yet to be evaluated.To address that gap, I develop six theoretically-tethered criteria of effective public participation (access, fair process, voice, dialogue, recognition, and legitimacy) through a review of the literature on relevant democracy and justice theory, particularly procedural justice and justice as recognition; the role of the administrative state; and the theory and history of environmental justice. I then refine and ground those measures through interviews with community activists, environmental justice advocates and regulatory agency staff and apply the grounded measures in a comparative case study of permitting processes that did or did not trigger New York's environmental justice policy. The data, collected through participant interviews, document review, and survey work and analyzed qualitatively, suggest that New York's policy improves the external framework for participation with marked improvements in objective measures of access and, to a lesser extent, social recognition. The policy creates the space for improvements in voice, dialogue, and institutional recognition, but does not ensure the internal changes to the decision-making structure necessary to guarantee these improvements. Organizational culture of the applicant and/or agency, community identity and composition, source and content of notice, and public meeting structure may also have significant impacts on the effectiveness of public participation and merit further investigation."
etd_576,Achieving Public Long-Term Care Insurance Through Social Security Wealth: Microsimulation for the US Case,Public Administration,"income, insurance, long-term care, Medicaid, social security, wealth","The risk of needing long-term care (LTC) at some point in one's life is non-negligible, and the cost of care–whether in formal or informal settings– can be prohibitive for many seniors. In fact LTC is sometimes labeled the last major uninsured expense for seniors in the United States. The majority of LTC costs are currently borne by Medicaid and out-of-pocket spending, while private insurance coverage remains minimal. The take-up of private insurance among American seniors has remained low, in part because of the large (and growing) cost of premiums, as well as the presence of Medicaid. As the payer of last resort, Medicaid forces seniors with LTC needs to liquidate their assets to bare minimums, and then use most of their retirement income as co-payment, leaving no possibility for bequests. Because there is no middle ground between costly private insurance and Medicaid, many middle-income seniors end up on Medicaid, sometimes after having sheltered assets away, thus burdening taxpayers with the cost of their care. Expanding on policy proposals by Chen (1993, 1994, 2003, 2007), and Murtaugh, Spillman & Warshawsky (2001, 2003), I propose an intermediate approach to LTC insurance, where universally-accessible, non-compulsory LTC insurance could be bought off Social Security wealth at age 65. Buyers with enough accumulated Social Security wealth at 65 would agree to receive lower Social Security retirement benefits for the remainder of their life, in exchange for a supplemental annuity in the event of LTC needs. Through a microsimulation of costs and benefits, I locate the area on the income/wealth distribution where taking up this LTC insurance would make economic sense for seniors. A secondary goal of the microsimulation will be to assess potential savings in Medicaid spending on LTC care."
bio_etd_86,Adaptation to Membrane Stress in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae: Identification of Novel Proteins and Mechanisms,Biology,"ergosterol, membrane, mitochondria, PDR, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe","Sensing and effectively responding to cellular stresses are fundamental processes for all living cells. In fungi, membrane stress is especially relevant because many clinically used antifungal agents target ergosterol, a fungal specific sterol necessary for the integrity of the plasma membrane. We hypothesized that there existed genes and processes involved in tolerance to membrane stress in fungi that remained to be discovered. Plants produce numerous and diverse secondary metabolites as a mechanism of defense against microorganisms. Many plant secondary metabolites have antifungal activity. However, the mechanism of activity for most plant secondary metabolites is unknown. Triterpene Glycosides (TTGs) are a structurally and functionally diverse group of molecules, many of which have antifungal activity. The antifungal activity of these molecules is thought to be due to the formation and aggregation of TTG-ergosterol complexes in fungal plasma membranes and the resulting disruption of plasma membrane integrity, but additional mechanisms of activity are also possible.The mechanism of activity and potential mechanisms of resistance to particular TTGs isolated from agria cacti (agria TTGs) were investigated in two complementary genome-wide screens using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model. In a high-copy suppression screen of the agria TTG sensitive phenotype of the sip3? strain, both novel and known genes and mechanisms contributing to membrane stress tolerance were found. Specifically, vesicular trafficking and Pleiotropic Drug Resistance (PDR) mediated changes in lipid composition were found to be mechanisms contributing to agria TTG resistance. Genes involved in ergosterol metabolism (PDR16), sphingolipid metabolism (LAG1), vesicular trafficking (AGE1) and calcium homeostasis (PMC1) increase tolerance of yeast cells to agria TTGs when present in high-copy number.The sip3? high-copy suppression screen also uncovered two related PDR target genes of unknown function that increase tolerance of yeast cells to membrane stress. These two genes are members of a small family of three PDR target genes, PDR19, PDR20 and PDR21, that share a seven residue region of homology. The analysis of the growth phenotypes of the three possible double mutants and the triple mutant reveal that these genes are functionally related and protect cells from membrane stress. Interestingly, the deletion of these genes results in resistance to ketoconazole, an inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis. Consistent with a role in membrane integrity, lack of these genes results in increased membrane permeability as measured by a Rhodamine 6G (R6G) uptake assay.In the initial genome-wide screen of haploid non-essential gene deletion strains in S. cerevisiae, the deletion of SIP3 and its paralog YSP1 resulted in sensitivity to agria TTGs. We decided to investigate the functions of these genes in more detail. We discovered that both these genes have similar growth phenotypes and are required for adaptation to membrane, weak acid and calcium stresses. The deletion of these genes also results in resistance to ketoconazole. We also found an unexpected, suppressive genetic interaction between these genes under some growth conditions. Additionally, SIP3 and YSP1 influence membrane permeability as measured by the R6G uptake assay.Ysp1 family proteins have a conserved predicted domain organization of adjacent BAR and PH domains (BAR-PH domain) at the amino terminus and a transmembrane helix at the carboxy terminus. We investigated the function of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ysp1 protein as well as its putative BAR-PH and transmembrane domains. The deletion of the S. pombe YSP1 homolog (ysp1+) results in a growth defect on the membrane active agents amphotericin B and digitonin, but not other antifungal agents, indicating that the S. pombe Ysp1 protein has a more restricted role in tolerance to membrane stress compared to the S. cerevisiae Ysp1 protein. The S. pombe Ysp1 protein is also required for optimal survival of cells exposed to a high dose of amphotericin B. The predicted BAR-PH and transmembrane domains of the S. pombe Ysp1 protein are both required for adaptation to membrane stress, as deletion of these domains results in a growth defect on media containing digitonin. Finally, the mutation of conserved, basic residues in the S. pombe ysp1+ BAR-PH domain results in growth defects under membrane stress conditions, indicating that conserved residues of the BAR-PH domain of the S. pombe Ysp1 protein are important to its function."
etd_197,ADAPTIVE POWER MANAGEMENT FOR COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"Power consumption has become a major concern in the design of computing systems today. High power consumption increases cooling cost, degrades the system reliability and also reduces the battery life in portable devices. Modern computing/communication devices support multiple power modes which enable power and performance tradeoff.  Dynamic power management (DPM), dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and dynamic task migration for workload consolidation are system level power reduction techniques widely used during runtime. In the first part of the dissertation, we concentrate on the dynamic power management of the personal computer and server platform where the DPM, DVFS and task migrations techniques are proved to be highly effective. A hierarchical energy management framework is assumed, where task migration is applied at the upper level to improve server utilization and energy efficiency, and DPM/DVFS is applied at the lower level to manage the power mode of individual processor. This work focuses on estimating the performance impact of workload consolidation and searching for optimal DPM/DVFS that adapts to the changing workload. Machine learning based modeling and reinforcement learning based policy optimization techniques are investigated.Mobile computing has been weaved into everyday lives to a great extend in recent years. Compared to traditional personal computer and server environment, the mobile computing environment is obviously more context-rich and the usage of mobile computing device is clearly imprinted with user's personal signature. The ability to learn such signature enables immense potential in workload prediction and energy or battery life management. In the second part of the dissertation, we present two mobile device power management techniques which take advantage of the context-rich characteristics of mobile platform and make adaptive energy management decisions based on different user behavior. We firstly investigate the user battery usage behavior modeling and apply the model directly for battery energy management. The first technique aims at maximizing the quality of service (QoS) while keeping the risk of battery depletion below a given threshold. The second technique is an user-aware streaming strategies for energy efficient smartphone video playback applications (e.g. YouTube) that minimizes the sleep and wake penalty of cellular module and at the same time avoid the energy waste from excessive downloading.Runtime power and thermal management has attracted substantial interests in multi-core distributed embedded systems. Fast performance evaluation is an essential step in the research of distributed power and thermal management. In last part of the dissertation, we present an FPGA based emulator of multi-core distributed embedded system designed to support the research in runtime power/thermal management. Hardware and software supports are provided to carry out basic power/thermal management actions including inter-core or inter-FPGA communications, runtime temperature monitoring and dynamic frequency scaling."
etd_5,"Addressing Trans-boundary Challenges Through Collaboration: How Organizations ""Harmonize"" Actions and Decisions Across Problem Landscapes",Public Administration,"Collaboration, Collaborative, Governance, Transboundary, Water policy, Watershed","Collaborative governance- or collaboration- has become increasingly important for the design and implementation of public policy in the United States. This dissertation explores concrete and unique policy-related benefits emerging from collaboration, and the processes by which they emerge.Collaboration is defined broadly as ""any interaction between two or more organizations undertaken with the intention to cooperate."" This definition is applied in the context of water quality management, where the physical nature of watersheds and the lack of regulatory authority available to policy-makers leads to a variety of collaborative arrangements.A survey of literatures addressing collaboration from different theoretical angles revealed five concrete, policy-related benefits of collaboration: 1) resource access/exchange, 2) innovation generation, 3) coordinated action, 4) working relationships built through social capital, and 5) reduction/resolution of conflict. A rich empirical dataset was developed to explore these benefits, utilizing one large case (the Chesapeake Bay watershed restoration) and one smaller case embedded in the first (water quality management in the Northern Virginia, or NOVA, region). Key data sources included 1081 Bay Journal newspaper articles and 86 hours of audio interviews. Coding revealed 456 instances in which collaboration led to one of the five benefits, including 243 instances of resource exchange/access, 99 instances of coordinated action, 62 instances of working relationships developed through social capital, 28 instances of innovation generation, and 24 instances of conflict resolution.The analysis in this dissertation focuses on the 99 empirical instances of coordinated action. A process common to all instances, called ""Harmonizing"", is identified and described. Harmonizing occurs when organizations address a shared problem at a scale that approaches the actual scale or scope of the problem. Chapter 5 features an original typology of harmonizing based on the type of ""problem landscape"" over which organizational actions are harmonized: geographical, organizational, or ecological. Chapter 6 describes how harmonizing solves three types of ""boundary"" problems common to many policy areas (not just water quality management) and results in more holistic and efficient policy-making by avoiding the pitfalls of duplication, divergence, omission, and counter-production (Huxham and MacDonald 1992).The context of collaboration is explored by applying three contextual codes to the data: 1) the types of groups collaborating, 2) the collaborative forum, and 3) the policy area in which collaboration occurs. A key contextual finding is that certain collaborative forums - particularly coordinating organizations- facilitate harmonizing under difficult conditions. A thematic analysis of the role of coordinating organizations, utilizing a broader spectrum of data, revealed in more detail the roles that coordinating organizations play in overcoming obstacles to collaboration such as competition, parochial perspectives, and accountability concerns.The greatest contributions of this dissertation relate to the benefit of coordinated action. However, a thematic analysis (presented in Chapter 8) uses empirical data to describe the other four benefits and processes by which they emerge. It is found that resource exchange generates benefits at the community level - not just at the organizational level as implied by resource exchange theory-- by expanding the overall resource base and improving organizations' collective ability to act. Another key finding is that including perceived ""naysayers"" in the decision process helps to prevent innovations from being squashed, by forcing a serious conversation about perceived versus real obstacles."
etd_433,Adolescent Health Behaviors Related to Reproductive Health: Does Structural Violence Matter?,Sociology,"Adolescent health, mental health, reproductive health, structural violence, women's health","Several studies have shown that race and socio-economic status are strongly linked to reproductive health. Disparities in rates of several measures of reproductive health and illness show the worst outcomes among minority women. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I examine adolescent behaviors related to reproductive health and reproductive health outcomes including STD diagnosis, number of pregnancies, and pregnancy outcomes in a sample of young women from adolescence to young adulthood using a series of regression analyses. Examining these outcomes within a social determinants of health framework, I find evidence to support the role of structural violence as a determinant of reproductive health. Young Black women and those with imprisoned parents experienced worse reproductive health outcomes, while those with more educated parents and closer familial relationships experienced more positive outcomes. Young women with a depression diagnosis also suffered more negative outcomes, demonstrating the importance of social support and access to health care for both physical and mental health."

Although the use of aggression by Korean adolescents has increased in contemporary Korean society, there is a lack of research on how adolescent personality traits and cultural values impact adolescent behavioral outcomes through parenting styles and psychological control. The sample included 361 parents (mothers and fathers) and their adolescents (7th and 8th grade) and the teachers of participating adolescents. Results indicated that adolescents' agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism were associated with adolescent overt, relational, and cyber aggression. Adolescents' Confucian values were associated with their relational and cyber aggression. Mothers' Confucian values were associated with their adolescents' overt aggression, and fathers' Confucian values were related to their adolescents' cyber aggression. Mothers' and fathers' authoritarianism did play an important role as a mediator in the relationship between adolescents' personality traits and their aggression. Adolescents' personality traits were associated with their overt aggression via a mediating role of fathers' and mothers' psychological control. Findings revealed that parenting styles and psychological control did not mediate the relationship between adolescent and parental Confucian values and adolescents' aggressive behavioral problems."

The idea of the IMR technique is to divide a large problem domain into smaller subregions, solve each subregion separately, and combine the solutions of subregions after introducing the effect of interaction to obtain solutions at multiple frequencies for the large domain. Solution of the subregions using the frequency domain solvers has been the preferred approach as such solutions using time domain solvers require computationally expensive bookkeeping of time signals between subregions. In this contribution we present an algorithm that makes it feasible to use the FDTD method, a time domain numerical technique, in the IMR technique to obtain solutions at a pre-specified number of frequencies in a single simulation. As a result, a considerable reduction in memory storage requirements and computation time is achieved.A hybrid method integrated into the IMR technique is also presented in this work. This hybrid method combines the desirable features of the method of moments (MoM) and the FDTD method to solve large-scale radiation problems more efficiently. The idea of this hybrid method based on the IMR technique is to divide an original problem domain into unconnected subregions and use the more appropriate method in each domain.The most prominent feature of this proposed method is to obtain solutions at multiple frequencies in a single IMR simulation by constructing time-limited waveforms. The performance of the proposed method is investigated numerically using different configurations composed of two, three, and four objects."

Positioning these artifacts and enactments as a specifically queer feminist praxis, I hone in on grrrl relationality and collectivity as the embodied space where political imaginings are carried out.  After first establishing the Riot Grrrl movement as a primarily affectively configured movement, I focus specifically on the mobilization of anger and intimacy within the movement.  First, I position anger as an emotion that enables a queering of patriarchal protection culture that the grrrls mobilize to subvert cultural logics of fear and established relations to state institutions of protection.  I argue that the mobilization of anger enables the grrrls to implement different practices of protection within the movement as an enactment of grrrl relationality.  Second, I locate intimacy through expressions of admiration, friendship, and desire.  Here, I highlight how the grrrls entangled friendship, admiration, and affiliation with an awareness of erotic possibility, opening the door for indefinite queer relations.  I describe this way of being Riot Grrrl as a “grrrl crush,” using the term as a politicized designation of the particularities of Riot Grrrl relationality as they identify and publically articulate their admiration and desire for other women and girls.  Taken together, I argue that focusing on these affective practices enables an understanding of what it means to enact Riot Grrrl.  Ultimately, this uncovers the political imaginings that propelled the movement forward and forged a process of becoming that allowed new queer intimacies, relations, and collective ways of being to emerge."

etd_94,"AGGLOMERATION ECONOMIES, INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT",Economics,"Agglomeration, Investment in Education, Regional Development, Spillovers","This dissertation consists of two essays that study the linkages among agglomeration economies, investment in education, and regional development.  In the first essay, I study the impact of a federal educational investment on various aspects of local economies.  In the second essay, I examine the spillover effects among workers with different skills, which are identified by their college majors.The first essay presents evidence of direct spillovers from universities and examines the short- and long-run effects of university activities on geographic clustering of economic activity, labor market composition and local productivity. I treat the designation of land-grant universities as a natural experiment after controlling for the confounding factors with a combination of synthetic control methods and event-study analyses. Three key results are obtained. First, the designation substantially increased local population density. Second, the share of manufacturing workers in the population, an indicator of labor market composition, was not affected by the designation. Third, the designation greatly enhanced local manufacturing productivity, as measured by local manufacturing output per worker, especially in the long run. This positive effect on the productivity in non-education sectors suggests the existence of spillovers from universities. Over an 80-year horizon, I estimate that most of the increase in manufacturing productivity was because of direct spillovers from universities instead of induced agglomeration economies that arise from the increase in population.The second essay studies the manner and extent to which worker skill type affects agglomeration economies that contribute to productivity in cities.  I use college major to proxy for skill type among workers with a Bachelor's degree. Workers with college training in information-oriented and technical fields (e.g. STEM areas such as Engineering, Physical Sciences, and Economics) are associated with economically important within-field agglomeration economies and also generate sizeable spillovers for workers in other fields.  In contrast to related work by Florida (2002a, 2002b), within-field and across-field spillovers for workers with college training in the arts and humanities are much smaller and often non-existent. While previous research suggests proximity to college-educated workers enhances productivity, these findings suggest that not all college educated workers are alike.  Instead, positive spillover effects appear to derive mostly from proximity to workers with training in information-oriented and technical fields."
eecs_etd_322,"Alignment, Clustering and Extraction of Structured Motifs in DNA Promoter Sequences",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Branch and Bound Search, Combinatorial Optimization, Dynamic Programming, Gap Constraints, Multiple Sequence Alignment, Structured Motif Extraction","A simple motif is a short DNA sequence found in the promoter region and believed to act as a binding site for a transcription factor protein. A structured motif is a sequence of simple motifs (boxes) separated by short sequences (gaps). Biologists theorize that the presence of these motifs play a key role in gene expression regulation. Discovering these patterns is an important step towards understanding protein-gene and gene-gene interaction thus facilitates the building of accurate gene regulatory network models. DNA sequence motif extraction is an important problem in bioinformatics. Many studies have proposed algorithms to solve the problem instance of simple motif extraction. Only in the past decade has the more complex structured motif extraction problem been examined by researchers.The problem is inherently challenging as structured motif patterns are segmented into several boxes separated by variable size gaps for each instance. These boxes may not be exact copies, but may have multiple mismatched positions. The challenge is extenuated by the lack of resources for real datasets covering a wide range of possible cases. Also, incomplete annotation of real data leads to the discovery of unknown motifs that may be regarded as false positives. Furthermore, current algorithms demand unreasonable amount of prior knowledge to successfully extract the target pattern.The contributions of this research are four new algorithms. First, SMGenerate generates simulated datasets of implanted motifs that covers a wide range of biologically possible cases. Second, SMAlign aligns a pair of structured motifs optimally and efficiently given their gap constraints. Third, SMCluster produces multiple alignment of structured motifs through hierarchical clustering using SMAlign's affinity score. Finally, SMExtract extracts structured motifs from a set of sequences by using SMCluster to construct the target pattern from the top reported two-box patterns (fragments), extracted using an existing algorithm (Exmotif) and a two-box template. The main advantage of SMExtract is its efficiency to extract longer degenerate patterns while requiring less prior knowledge, about the pattern to be extracted, than current algorithms."
etd_322,All Joking Aside: The Role of Religion in American Jewish Satire,Religion,"American Judaism, Cultural Studies, Humor theory, Jewish humor, Jewish literature, Judaism","Jewish humor is a well-known, if ill-defined genre. The prevalence and success of Jewish comedians has been a point of pride for American Jews throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. What I undertake in this dissertation is to isolate one particular form of humor-namely satire-and use it as a way to analyze the changing relationship of American Jews to traditional religious forms. I look at the trends over three generations, the third generation (who came of age in the 40s and 50s), the Baby Boom generation (who came of age in the 60s and 70s) and the contemporary generation (who came of age in the 80s and 90s). When the satire produced by each generation is analyzed with the depiction of Judaism and Jewish practices in mind a certain pattern emerges. By then reading that pattern through Bill Brown's Thing Theory it becomes possible to talk about the motivations for and effects of the change over time in a new way. What the analysis revealed is that the third generation related to Judaism as a Thing, which in Brownian terms means it no longer functioned. Some, like Woody Allen and Joseph Heller actively promulgated that way of breaking free from the shackles of piety. Others, like Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud saw the turning of Judaism into a Thing as establishing dangerous precedents for inter-Jewish relationships. The Baby Boom generation lacked their own take on the turning of Judaism into a Thing; early on they matched the third generation, later they matched the contemporary generation. And the contemporary generation, rather than being content with the Judaism-Thing they inherited reversed the process, injecting new life and new purpose into Jewish practices in their texts."

Using archival and archaeological evidence from households at the Cabrits Garrison occupied by lower status personnel in the British army, including enslaved laborers and soldiers of African descent, this study attempts two broad goals: (1) to critically examine the anthropological phenomena of African-Caribbean social formation through a study of settlement patterns and material culture, and (2) to write an archaeological history describing the everyday lives of subordinate groups living within the walls of this fort. My analysis is situated within the longer history of conflict and labor that impacted the formation of colonial communities throughout the Atlantic world between the 18th and 19th centuries. I employ a household level approach using intra-site comparisons and analytical approaches to reconstruct occupational histories and social interactions in a period of changing military labor practices. Findings demonstrate the varied and often contradictory nature of colonial identities at living spaces situated within the conceived landscape of British imperialism. Approaching British fortifications in this manner contributes to black Atlantic military history—a lens that works to represent the diversity of these military communities and the tangible and intangible products of their labor."
etd_194,Alpha Background Study In Dark Matter Detection,Physics,"Alpha Background, BetaCage, Dark Matter Detection, MiniCLEAN, Simulation","Long-life isotopes 238U and 232Th exist in almost any material. 222Rn, as a daughter of 238U, widely exists in the atmosphere. It has a half-life of 3.8 days, which is long enough for it to travel and diffuse through material surfaces.  The alphas and betas from radon daughters are a dominant background for essentially all rare-event searches, including dark matter searches.Dark matter detectors require very low background because WIMPs have very small cross-sections with nuclei. Alpha decay on the inner surface of the liquid argon sphere is one of the dominant backgrounds. This dissertation has described the simulation and discrimination of this surface alpha decay background in the MiniCLEAN experiment. By a combination of analysis specifically to reduce these events(energy, pulse shape discrimination and position reconstruction), and by hardware changes (the adding of baffles), the surface alpha background is reduced sufficiently.Reduction of these surface backgrounds may also be achieved using the BetaCage, which is planned to be the most sensitive low-energy electron and alpha screener ever.  This dissertation described the simulation of photon and radon backgrounds of BetaCage. The simulation shows that the sensitivity goal is achieved, 1000 times better than current detectors. This dissertation has described the simple model and method of particle track reconstruction."

This study was conducted to determine whether these decreases could be explained by changes in organically bound Al (Alorg) in soils. The concentrations of Alorg, exchangeable Al (AlKCl) and other chemical properties in organic (Oi + Oe, Oa) and 0-10 cm mineral soil layers were measured using samples collected prior to treatment (1998) and afterwards (2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014). Compared to pre-treatment values, Alorg concentrations in the Oa horizon and the 0-10 cm mineral soil layer increased by 312% and 803%, respectively; over the same period, AlKCl concentrations in these horizons decreased by 57% and 15%, respectively. Through 2014, the Alorg pool in the 0-10 cm mineral soil layer increased by 602% compared to the pretreatment value, whereas the AlKCl pool in the Oa horizon decreased by 84%. In the surface Oi + Oe horizon, no significant changes in soil Al concentrations and pools were observed after the treatment, though AlKCl concentrations showed a slight decrease. Aluminum is migrating downward from the Oa horizon to the 0-10 cm mineral layer. The predominant form of Al binding has shifted from weaker exchangeable Al to stronger organically bound Al. This conversion of exchangeable Al to organically bound Al has reduced Al solubility and contributed to improved forest health."

The conceptual framework advanced for this study incorporated the constructs of innovation, creativity and context awareness while offering emergence theory -- emergent properties, structures, patterns and behaviors -- to frame and investigate a wireless grid enabled social radio application which was theorized to be potentially transformative and disruptive. The unintended consequences and unexpected possibilities of wireless grid and smart environments were also addressed.Using a single case study, drawing upon multiple data collection methods, this research investigated the deployment and use experience of WeJay, an application incubated through the Wireless Grids Innovation Testbed (WiGiT), from the perspective of beta trial participants. Guided by the broad research question -- Do wireless grid enabled applications, such as WeJay social radio, add to the potential for new and transformative outcomes for people, information and technology when deployed in an academic setting? -- this empirical study sought to: a) learn more about the launch experience of this first pre-standards wireless grid enabled application among WiGiT members and selected Syracuse University students and faculty; b) understand how this application was interpreted for use; c) determine whether novel and unexpected uses emerged; d) investigate whether wireless grid enabled environments fostered innovation and creativity; and e) elicit whether a conceptual relationship was emerging between wireless grid and AmI environments, focusing on context-awareness and ambient learning.While this early stage of diffusion and first user sample was a key limitation of the study it was also the core strength. Although challenged by the state of readiness of WeJay, study findings supported the propositions that WeJay fosters innovation and creativity; that novel and unexpected uses were generated; and that the theorized relationship between wireless grid applications and embedded awareness does exist. Recommendations for enhanced tool readiness were made and embedded smartness was found to be both desirable and beneficial. This research makes a contribution as a bridge study for future research while having theoretical and methodological implications for research and practice. Social, emotion/affect, and human-centered computing (HCC) dimensions emerged as rich areas for further research."

What has resulted due to large concentration of Caribbean immigrants is a hub of Caribbean culture that impacts everyday life and has helped to create a narrative that goes beyond previous understandings of what it means to be Caribbean in America. This project explores Caribbean immigrant experiences in the United States labor market with the immigrants’ voices and experiences as the driving force in presenting the information, with specific reference to Brooklyn, New York (NY).This project utilizes a political economy framework of historical materialism and Black feminist theories to examine society through a gendered lens of intersectionality that sees gender, race and class as equally important in understanding Caribbean immigrant women’s experiences in New York City. In order to underscore the experiences of Caribbean immigrants, data from interviews with Caribbean immigrants living and working in New York City are used to present a cohesive narrative of what life is like post migration."
etd_63,America's New Internationalists?: Evangelical Transnational Activism and U.S. Foreign Policy,Political Science,"American evangelicalism, Christian missions, HIV/AIDS, holistic mission, religious persecution, transnational activism","Previously known for their domestic social and political activism, American evangelical Christians have recently been called the ""new internationalists"" for their growing transnational work and foreign policy advocacy. This dissertation examines the two following questions regarding this phenomenon: First, how have American evangelicals come to recover social action in general as an essential part of their foreign missions? The modernist-fundamentalist divide in the early twentieth century America made evangelicals reject the so-called ""Social Gospel"" of their liberal counterpart and embrace ""spiritual"" mission, such as evangelism and church planting, as the primary, if not the only, mission of the church. Evangelicals' current interest in various social issues beyond their borders exhibits a clear reversal of this emphasis. Second, how do evangelical activists address specific transnational issues? Is there anything distinctively ""evangelical"" about their approach to it? I answer these questions by examining what rhetorical strategies or ""frames"" U.S. evangelical leaders have devised and articulated in order to legitimate and mobilize support for their transnational activism and more U.S. government involvement. In doing so, I show how evangelical activists' shared religious beliefs and language justify, shape, and constrain their transnational political engagement and how the latter in turn reconstructs the former.To answer the first question, I look into the often neglected history and theology of evangelical foreign missions. By utilizing existing studies by mission historians and theologians, along with my own textual analysis of mission archives and publications, I show how different conceptualizations of ""mission"" have been developed within global evangelicalism and are currently promoted and practiced by U.S. evangelical mission organizations. The two main points of contention among advocates of different frames of mission have been the relationship between evangelism and social action and the proper nature and extent of the latter. I find that the more holistic and socially oriented notion of ""mission as transformation"" has been increasingly favored as an alternative to the traditional focus on evangelism and church building, although the latter still remains prevalent among many U.S. evangelical mission agencies in practice.My analysis of evangelical campaigns against religious persecution and HIV/AIDS abroad--the two issues that have garnered most attention from evangelicals in recent years--shows the basic tensions identified above between spiritual and social mission and, analogously, individual and structural approaches to social problems. Despite the call for a more holistic approach, I argue that the ways evangelical activists frame the two issues have been largely individualistic. In the religious persecution case, it is manifested in the individualistic notion of religion, the emphasis on religious freedom over other human rights, the distrust in governments of both the U.S. and persecuting countries, and the emphasis on saving individuals over promoting long-term, structural changes. In the global HIV/AIDS case, evangelical individualism is most clearly expressed in the promotion of individual moral and behavioral change through abstinence and fidelity as the best solution to the pandemic.Although this individualism has often been considered as uniquely ""American,"" I dispute the notion that contemporary evangelical transnational activism is primarily either a handmaiden of American imperialism or an extension of American domestic culture wars. Rather, it is better understood as a case of ""rooted cosmopolitans"" engaging in ""reverse mission,"" indicating the importance of American religious communities' transnational connections and identities and their transformative impact on not only the communities themselves, but the broader U.S. politics and policy. My dissertation also supports the argument that religion and religious activism are neither static nor monolithic, but socially constructed though religious actors' dynamic interaction with their own religious tradition and surrounding social, political, and cultural environment."
etd_630,Amphibious Subjects: Sassoi and the Contested Politics of Queer Self-Making in Neoliberal Ghana,Anthropology,"Human Rights, LGBT Politics, Neoliberalism, Race, Sassoi, Sexual Citizenship","“Welcome!! Akwaaba!! Ghana warmly welcomes all visitors of goodwill. Ghana does not welcome paedophiles and other sexual deviants. Indeed Ghana imposes extremely harsh penalties on such sexually aberrant behaviour. If you are in Ghana for such activity, then for everybody’s good, including your own, we suggest you go elsewhere.” This sign greets arrivals at Ghana’s Kotoka International Airport, the main port of entry by flight into the country, drawing their attention to the proscriptive and prescriptive values around sexuality and sexual practices. In red font, sexual deviance is left ambiguous, leaving the reader to interpret (signify) the sign.“Amphibious Subjects” is an ethnographic investigation of the lives of self-identified effeminate men in urban postcolonial Ghana, collectively known in local parlance as sassoi. A study exploring the hidden transcripts beyond signs like the one at the airport, it also critically engages assumptions about Ghana as simultaneously heterosexual and homophobic, oppositional views parroted by the nation-state and international LGBT human rights organizations such as Aidspan and local NGOS such as Bring Us Rights and Justice (BURJ). Drawing on my personal interactions with sassoi, participant observation, autoethnography, research at an NGO, archival sources, and critical analyses of documentaries on homophobia in Africa, such as the BBC’s “The World’s Worst Place to Be Gay,” I examine the racialized image of Africa as the ‘heart of homophobic darkness’ in LGBT human rights rhetoric, engaging with the literary critiques of white humanism proffered by Chinua Achebe and James Baldwin.Echoing sassoi stories and their experiences in relation to NGOs that claim to highlight their precarious situations, the nation-state, and their immediate communities and families, I argue that their subjectivity is analogous to what Kwame Gyekye, the Ghanaian philosopher, calls “amphibious identification.” Gyekye stresses that amphibious personhood among the Akan ethnolinguistic group of Ghana is embodied by the adinkra symbol, funtunfunefu-denkyemfunefu, —the Siamese crocodile, which epitomizes how self-making is neither reducible to the individual nor the community. Thus, for him, the individual, while embedded in a group, has room for self-assertion. At a moment when Ghana, like the African continent, is under pressure from western governments to embrace LGBT visibility, there has been a backlash against such push from the nation-state, civil society, and conservative religious and moral publics. In these shifting milieus, sassoi, who are corporeally effeminate, adopt practices of the self, parallel to Gyekye’s amphibious subject. Some of the spaces in which they enact effeminacy include rituals of transition such as birth ceremonies and even birthdays. The significance of these events for sassoi practices of the self is often elided in the debates spurred by LGBT human rights discourses.Against this backdrop, I draw on the amphibian as an analytic to unpack the convoluted ways in which sassoi play with and along LGBT NGOs desire to highlight their tragedies, while rejecting such organizations’ efforts to identify them as LGBT. Their forms of queer self-making thus occur in the ‘nervous conditions,’ to use Tsitsi Dangaremba’s felicitous metaphor, that are coterminously palimpsestic and contemporary. “Amphibious Subjects” stages those complexities that lie beyond the pavlovian construction of Africa as a homophobic safari in LGBT rhetoric, a racialized projection, and as primarily heterosexual in heteronationalist discourses, an uncritical anthropological fallacy."

A distinct efficient record-and-playback mechanism is designed to record all the internal states of execution including intermediate results by injecting our own bytecode, which does not affect the source code, and, through a two-step data processing mechanism, these data will be aggregated, structured and parallel processed for the purpose of replay in high fidelity while keeping the overhead at a satisfactory level. Docker and Git are employed to create a clean environment such that the execution will be undertaken repeatedly with a maximum precision of reproducing bugs. In our development, several other forefront technologies, such as MongoDB, Spark and Node.js are utilized and smoothly integrated for easy implementation. Altogether, we develop a system for Java Debugging Execution Visualization and Verification (JDevv), a debugging tool for Java although our debugging approach can apply to other languages as well. JDevv also offers an aggregated and interactive visualization for the ease of users’ code verification."

The naturally occurring, audio and/or video-recorded data regarding initial sessions conducted by trainees in both professions were used to explore three overarching questions:  (1) How are the conversations between trainees and clients developed and maintained in their initial encounters? (2) How are therapeutic relationships and therapeutic discourses developed in initial sessions? (3) How do co-constructed, sequential interactions at the moment produce subsequent actions and interactions such as disclosures, presentation of challenging communications, and vulnerability? The results indicated that while professional practice was contextual and circumstantial, both professions in this study share a number of strategies and talk features with regard to the development of therapeutic relationships, the process of disclosures, and the presentation of unique interactions as a result of co-constructed therapeutic discourses. The study of talk and interaction provides authentic materials of clinical practices and a comprehensive analytic framework for supervision. Future studies regarding clinical encounters, working alliances, and therapeutic discourses that include analyses of talk and interactions will provide additional insight and enrich the methodological repertoires for current studies related to the best practices, effective therapeutic alliances, and communications."
etd_546,AN ELECTROCHEMICAL METHOD TO EVALUATE LOCALIZED CORROSION IN RETRIEVED MODULAR TAPERED ORTHOPEDIC IMPLANTS,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"In most of retrieval cases, severe taper damage and failed implant surgery result in revisions. However, some damage of tapers might not be too severely to be require replacinged the component. Surgeons, however, have no clear means for judging the quality of the corroded interface other than visual inspection. Because of this, it is very critical to have a method to determine the extent and severity of corrosion and fretting damage at the modular junction to minimize the risks to patients and to determine whether a patient needs to have their implant undergo revision surgery for secondary hip replacementremoved during revision surgery.This study aims to develop an assessment method for new and damaged tapered head and neck junctions to analyze the corrosion state of retrieved taper interfaces of modular hip prostheses. To do this, the relationship between the degree of fretting and corrosion damage of a set of retrieved modular hip prostheses with a range of corrosion damage present, and their associated corrosion behavior of damaged tapersneeds to be established.It was hypothesized in this study that the retrieved modular hip prostheses would reveal with a range of surface corrosion and fretting damage, particularly corrosion,  on the bore-cone tapers and that the said surface damage would exhibit different corrosion characteristics (electrochemical impedance characteristics) depending on the type of designs and taper geometryseverity of corrosion observed. A visual corrosion scoring method (The Goldberg scale) . Moreover, it is also hypothesized that the corrosion behavior of the retrieved tapers is a function of the extent of prior corrosion damage. A visual scoring system, the Goldberg’s 4-point scoring system, is was used to determine any indication of the extent and severity of corrosion based on the extent and severity of surface damage seen at the taper. The taper surfaces were then evaluated using electrochemical impedance methods and a correlation between the results from electrochemical test could be correspond to and the Goldberg’s scale was investigated.The results of this study establish show that the retrieved modular hip prostheses with a wide range of corrosion damage exhibit surface damage on the bore-cone tapers. Strong evidence of corrosion in for both same-metal and mixed metal tapered modular hip prostheses is presented. Moreover, various types of corrosion such as etching, fretting, pitting, intergranular attack, fracture, and a selective leakage of cobalt exist in vivo in the taper interfaces of modular hip prostheses studied. The results of the electrochemical test showed that the decline exhibited a strong correlation in the constant phase element (CPE) impedance and CPE exponent polarization resistance and interfacial capacitance of most of the samples tested and their Goldberg score. indicates an increase in corrosion. Also, the impedance and phase angle at 0.01 Hz could were different based on the extent of corrosion observed. This was translated into corrosion current from the whole surface. The presence of mechanically assisted crevice corrosion was confirmed based on the tests and observations conducted on the samples. However, the result might be due toWhile there were the limitations in this study related to and unstable conditions during some of the experiments, this method was reasonably able to assess the extent of taper damage present. Future studies are necessary to learn more about the damage mechanisms that exist at the head and neck junctions and their effect on the impedance behavior of the damaged surface. The method described may be a possible means for clinical assessment of the extent of corrosion damage present in modular trunnions during revision surgery., this study established that severe corrosion could happen in modular head and neck junctions during in vivo function. Future studies should ensure optimal conditions and the stability of the experiment process to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the corrosion behavior of the retrieved tapers and the extent of prior corrosion damage. Overall, this study develops a new field for retrieval study of modular hip prostheses."

But a precise definition of  big data is hazy (Dumbill, 2013). Instead, the healthcare industry mainly relies on metaphors, buzzwords, and slogans that fail to provide information about big data's content, value, or purposes for existence (Burns, 2011). Bollier and Firestone (2010) even suggests ""big data does not really exist in healthcare"" (p. 29). While federal policymakers and other healthcare stakeholders struggle with the adoption of Meaningful Use Standards, International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10), and electronic health record interoperability standards, big data in healthcare remains a widely misunderstood phenomenon. Borgman (2012) found by ""studying how data are created, handled, and managed in multi-disciplinary collaborations, we can inform science policy and practice"" (p. 12).Through the narratives of nine leaders representing three key stakeholder classes in the healthcare ecosystem: government, providers and consumers, this phenomenological research study explored a fundamental question: Within and across the narratives of three key healthcare stakeholder classes, what are the important categories of meaning or current themes about big data in healthcare? This research is significant because it: (1) produces new thematic insights about the meaning of big data in healthcare through narrative inquiry; (2) offers an agile framework of big data that can be deployed across all industries; and, (3) makes a unique contribution to scholarly qualitative literature about the phenomena of big data in healthcare for future research on topics including the diffusion and spread of health information across networks, mixed methods studies about big data, standards development, and health policy."

It was hypothesized that secure attachment would correlate with satisfied body image in the daughters and the belief that their mother's had a satisfied image of the daughter's body. Participants were female undergraduate students recruited from a private university. Participants completed self-report questionnaires about attachment (Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, IPPA), body image (Contour Drawing Rating Scale, CDRS), and a researcher created demographic questionnaire. The IPPA and CDRS had two versions, one asking participants to answer based on their current age and the other asking them to report about when they were 11 years old. Attachment was negatively correlated to the daughter's perception of what her mother thinks of her body both at participants' current age and at age 11. Daughter's body image was positively correlated to the daughter's perception of what her mother thinks of her body again both at current age and age 11. A secure attachment between mothers and daughters was related to the daughter believing her mother has a positive image of her body. This in turn was related to the daughter having a positive image of her own body as well. Attachment and body image accounted for 25% during pre-adolescence and 22% during adolescence of the variance is what the daughter thinks her mother thinks of the daughter's body. Further research is needed to expand on the development of body image during pre-adolescence and its connection to attachment and familial relationships."
etd_76,AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF FLAME-ASSISTED FUEL CELLS,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,,"Flame-assisted fuel cells (FFCs) based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have received more attention in recent years due to their simple configuration and capability of utilizing hydrocarbons directly to produce electricity.  However, the power outputs of FFCs are relatively low compared to that of dual chamber SOFCs (DC-SOFCs) and single chamber SOFCs (SC-SOFCs).  Further, the carbon coking and thermal shock issues still prohibit wide applications of FFCs.  Moreover, operating conditions of FFCs such as relative positions between flames and fuel cells and fuel flow rates, are important factors that affect the FFCs power output and such data are currently lacking.  The main purposes of this dissertation study are: (1) develop a composite cathode and a catalyst layer in order to improve the power output and the coking resistance of FFCs; (2) investigate the effects of operating conditions on FFCs performance; and (3) develop FFCs with high power outputs and high thermal shock resistance by adapting fuel cells with different configurations.To improve the FFCs performance, a composite cathode Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3?? (BSCF) + Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-? (SDC) was first investigated and optimized.  Experimental results showed that the electrochemical performance of a BSCF+SDC composite cathode was greatly influenced by sintering temperatures, and the best sintering temperature for the BSCF+SDC composite cathode was determined.  Later, a mesoporous SDC/Ru catalyst was developed and examined.  The highly porous structure of the SDC/Ru catalyst ensured fast diffusion of gas inside of the catalyst layer and exhibited a relatively high power output and effective carbon coking resistance.  Experimental results also showed that the performance of the electrolyte supported SOFC (ES-SOFC) based FFCs strongly depended on the location of the fuel cell with respect to the FFCs temperature.  The ES-SOFC based FFCs also presented a low thermal shock resistance due to its thick electrolyte.To address the thermal shock issue of the ES-SOFCs based FFCs and to further improve the FFCs performance, we have developed two different FFCs configurations based on anode-supported SOFCs (AS-SOFCs): SDC based FFCs and YSZ (Yttria stabilized Zirconia)-SDC based FFCs.  The SDC based FFCs exhibited much better performance and thermal shock resistance when compared to that of ES-SOFCs.  A power density of ~ 791 mW.cm-2 and a maximum current density of ~ 2300 mA.cm-2 were achieved, which are comparable to the performances of the DC-SOFCs and SC-SOFCs.  The total flow rates and fuel flow rates were found to have a great effect on the FFCs temperatures and fuel concentration, thus further impacting the FFCs performance.  The YSZ-SDC based FFCs were then fabricated and investigated.  The sintering temperatures of the FFC electrolyte were found to determine the FFC performance, and 1350 oC is the favorable sintering temperature to achieve the dense electrolyte and the best power output.  Experimental results also showed that the YSZ-SDC based FFCs exhibited the higher OCVs, but lower power densities compared to that of SDC based SOFCs.  However, the performance of YSZ-SDC based FFCs dropped much slower for higher equivalent ratios compare to that of SDC based SOFCs, which could effectively expand the FFCs operating windows."
etd_75,AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PEROVSKITE-STRUCTURED MIXED IONIC- ELECTRONIC CONDUCTING OXIDES AND MEMBRANES,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Air separation, Ceramics, Composite oxides, Methane oxidation, Oxygen permeation membrane, Perovskite oxides","In recent decades, ceramic membranes based on mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite-structured oxides have received many attentions for their applications for air separation, or as a membrane reactor for methane oxidation.  While numerous perovskite oxide materials have been explored over the past two decades; there are hardly any materials with sufficient practical economic value and performance for large scale applications, which justifies continuing the search for new materials.  The main purposes of this thesis study are: (1) develop several novel SrCoO3-? based MIEC oxides, SrCo1-xMxO3-?, based on which membranes exhibit excellent oxygen permeability; (2) investigate the significant effects of the species and concentration of the dopants M (metal ions with fixed valences) on the various properties of these membranes; (3) investigate the significant effects of sintering temperature on the microstructures and performance of oxygen permeation membranes; and (4) study the performance of oxygen permeation membranes as a membrane reactor for methane combustion.To stabilize the cubic phase structure of the SrCoO3-? oxide, various amounts of scandium was doped into the B-site of SrCoO3-? to form a series of new perovskite oxides, SrScxCo1-xO3-? (SSCx, x = 0-0.7).  The significant effects of scandium-doping concentration on the phase structure, electrical conductivity, sintering performance, thermal and structural stability, cathode performance, and oxygen permeation performance of the SSCx membranes, were systematically studied.  Also for a more in-depth understanding, the rate determination steps for the oxygen transport process through the membranes were clarified by theoretical and experimental investigation.  It was found that only a minor amount of scandium (5 mol%) doping into the B-site of SrCoO3-? can effectively stabilize the cubic phase structure, and thus significantly improve the electrical conductivity and oxygen permeability of the SrCoO3-? membrane.  Among all the disk-shaped SSCx (x = 0-0.7) membranes with a thickness of 0.91 mm, both SSC0.05 and SSC0.1 exhibit the highest oxygen permeation rate of about 3.2 mL.cm-2.min-1 (STP) at 900 oC, SSC0.1 also shows excellent cathode performance for a solid oxide fuel cell.  Therefore SSC0.1 is of special interest, and thus investigated regarding the performance as a membrane reactor for methane combustion.  The performance was evaluated based on the results of methane conversion rates and CO2 selectivity.Inspired by the above findings, a series of mixed-conducting perovskite oxides SrCo0.95M0.05O3-? (SCM, M = Bi5+, Zr4+, Ce4+, Sc3+, La3+, Y3+, Al3+ , Zn2+) were prepared to study the effects of different dopants M on the performance of SrCo0.95M0.05O3-?.  It was found that the M cations significantly affect the crystal phase structure, grain growth, membrane porosity, electrical conductivity, and the oxygen permeability of the SCM membranes.  Specifically, it is postulated in this study that the formation of the cubic perovskite structure is dependent on the electron configuration in the outer orbits of M cations, which may provide theoretical guidance for future development of high oxygen permeation ceramic membranes based on the perovskite materials.To study the significant effects of grain sizes on the oxygen permeation behaviors of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-? (LSCF) and SrSc0.1Co0.9O3-? (SSC0.1) membranes, the LSCF and SSC0.1 membranes were sintered at various temperatures to form different microstructures.  Properties of these membranes with varied grain sizes were compared.  Results showed that the oxygen permeation rate of the LSCF membrane increases with increasing the grain size, however, it is interesting that the oxygen permeation rate of the SSC0.1 membrane decreases with increasing the grain size.  This implies that oxygen transport occurs more, however, less rapidly along grain boundaries than through the bulks in the LSCF and SSC0.1 membranes, respectively.A LSCF hollow fiber membrane and a SSC0.1 planar membrane were applied as membrane reactors for methane combustion.  To improve their performances, LSCF powder and SSC0.1 powder were dip-coated and spray-coated on the permeation sides of LSCF hollow fiber membranes and SSC0.1 planar membranes, respectively.  The exhaust gas components were analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC).  The performance was evaluated based on the results of methane conversion rates and CO2 selectivity.  The highest CO2 selectivity of the LSCF hollow fiber membrane and the SSC0.1 planar membrane is about 88 and 85 %, respectively.  This indicates that the application of an oxygen permeation membrane as methane combustion reactor is feasible."

Unlike traditional fossil fuels, biodiesel is more environment-friendly and it is renewable, which can help people solve the energy crisis to some extent.Nowadays, supercritical esterification has become a novel way to produce biodiesel, but high temperature may cause the decomposition of biodiesel. Researchers mainly focus on studying the properties of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), however, fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) biodiesel has only been slightly explored. So in this study, ethanol was used to synthesize biodiesel instead of methanol. Also, the thermal decomposition of FAEE biodiesel with excess ethanol was also studied.In the synthesis studies of FAEE biodiesel, the conditions evaluated were: molar ratio of ethanol to oil of 9:1, potassium hydroxide is chosen as the catalyst, and the reaction is kept at 75°C (±1°C) and 1 atm for 2 hours. In order to study the decomposition of biodiesel, the thermal decomposition experiments were performed in stainless steel coils at the temperature from 250°C to 425°C for residence time from 3 to 63 minutes. When ethanol was added, the volume ratio of ethanol to biodiesel was 1:1. All the products were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS.There are mainly three kinds of reactions observed in the thermal decomposition of biodiesel: isomerization, polymerization and pyrolysis. They occurred at the following temperature range respectively: ? 275 °C, ? 300 °C and ? 350 °C. When the temperature is below 275 °C, the decomposition ratio is less than 5%, which suggests that FAEE biodiesel is stable below 275 °C. It is also found that at a given temperature, longer residence time results in higher decomposition ratio.A first-order reversible reaction model was proposed to represent the thermal decomposition of FAEE biodiesel, this model fits the experimental data very well from 250 °C to 400 °C. At 425 °C, the first-order irreversible reaction model is better, which suggests that the main reaction is pyrolysis at 425 °C. The reaction rate constants were calculated using these two models.Kinetic analysis was also conducted. The Arrhenius equation and van't Hoff equation were used to define the kinetic parameters. For the forward reaction, the pre-exponential factor (A) is 2.54×109 min-1 and the activation energy (Ea) is 128.2 kJ/mol. For the reverse reaction, A is 7.98 min-1 and Ea is 29.6 kJ/mol. For the entire reaction, the standard enthalpy (?H0) is 98.6 kJ/mol. In fitting the data, the high coefficient of determination of higher than 0.97 was obtained, which supports the hypothesis that the first-order reversible reaction model was reasonable over the range of conditions studied."

The developed Disassembly Information Model, which represents an appropriate systematization and classification of the products, processes, uncertainties and degradations related information, follows a layered modeling methodology. In this layered configuration, the DIM is subdivided into three distinct layers with an intent to separate general knowledge into different levels of abstractions, and to reach a balance between information reusability and information usability. The performance evaluation of the DIM (usability and reusability) is accessed by successful implementations of the DIM model into two prototype software applications in the domain of disassembly planning.The first application, called the Disassembly Sequence Generator (DSG), identifies the optimal disassembly sequence using a CAD based searching algorithm and a disassembly Linear Programming (LP) model. The searching process results in an AND/OR graph, which represents all the feasible disassembly sequences of a specific EOL product; whereas the LP model takes the AND/OR graph as an input and determines the economically optimal process sequence among all the possibilities.The second application is called the Adaptive Disassembly Planning (ADP), which further takes the EOL product uncertainty and degradation issues into consideration. In order to address these issues, fuzzy logic and Bayesian Network methodologies are used to develop a Disassembly Decision Network (DDN), which adaptively generates the optimal disassembly sequence based on the current available information.This research work is the first attempt to develop a comprehensive Information Model in the domain of disassembly planning. The associated modeling methodology that has been developed in this research is generic and scalable, and it could be widely adopted in other engineering domains, like product assembly, production planning, etc. The ultimate objective of this work is to standardize the DIM into a reference model that will be acknowledged and agreed upon by the sustainable manufacturing community."
soc_etd_78,"An Intersectional Analysis of the Female Postsecondary Advantage: Gender, race, and College Selectivity",Sociology,"college enrollment, female advantage, gender and race in education, higher education","This dissertation utilizes nationally representative data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) to investigate two sets of research questions: 1) Among those who have completed high school or received a GED, to what extent do school behaviors, attitudes toward school/teacher and parental involvement impact gender and racial/ethnic differences in precollege achievement?; 2) Among those who have completed high school or received a GED, to what extent are gender and racial/ethnic differences explained by students' pre-college academic achievement, educational and parental expectations net of socio-economic background, family structure and high school characteristics?Two theoretical perspectives are used: gender role theory and oppositional culture. The results suggest that gender role theory partially explains why females who have completed high school have higher precollege achievement especially high school GPA. It finds that females are better classroom citizens and have more positive school values compared to males. They also have higher educational and parental expectations. Regardless of race/ethnicity, among those who complete high school or the equivalent, females outperform males in high school GPA.The results suggest that oppositional culture does not account for racial/ethnic differences in precollege achievement or college enrollment especially because black students who complete high school do not have lower educational expectations. Also, racial/ethnic differences in school behaviors and attitudes do not explain why black and Hispanic students have lower academic achievement in this population.In terms of race/ethnicity in precollege achievement, among those who have completed high school, white students have great advantages over both black and Hispanic students. The study largely supports structural explanations related to SES and high school characteristics.In terms of college enrollment, high school GPA is the most important factor. Among those who have completed high school, females have a great advantage over males in overall college enrollment and the female advantage also exists within each racial/ethnic group. However, the advantage of females in both selective and nonselective 4-year colleges is explained by gender differences in high school GPA. Among high school graduates, once males are similar to females in terms of high school GPA, these two groups are not different in 4-year college enrollment. For racial/ethnic differences in college enrollment, the study finds that black and Hispanic students have the lowest rate of college enrollment, and they are less likely to go to any college compared to their white peers. However, there is a net black/Hispanic advantage in overall college enrollment, suggesting that when black, Hispanic, and white students have completed high school and have similar socioeconomic background and precollege achievement, black and Hispanic students are more likely than are white students to go to any colleges and especially selective colleges. As was the case for pre-college achievement, the results largely support structural explanations when it comes to racial/ethnic differences in college enrollment."
it_etd_81,An Investigation of Digital Reference Interviews: A Dialogue Act Approach,Information Science and Technology,"dialogue acts, discourse analysis, library, machine learning, online chat, reference","The rapid increase of computer-mediated communications (CMCs) in various forms such as micro-blogging (e.g. Twitter), online chatting (e.g. digital reference) and community- based question-answering services (e.g. Yahoo! Answers) characterizes a recent trend in web technologies, often referred to as the social web. This trend highlights the importance of supporting linguistic interactions in people's online information-seeking activities in daily life - something that the web search engines still lack because of the complexity of this hu- man behavior. The presented research consists of an investigation of the information-seeking behavior of digital reference services through analysis of discourse semantics, called dialogue acts, and experimentation of automatic identification of dialogue acts using machine-learning techniques. The data was an online chat reference transaction archive, provided by the Online Computing Library Center (OCLC). Findings of the discourse analysis include supporting evidence of some of the existing theories of the information-seeking behavior. They also suggest a new way of analyzing the progress of information-seeking interactions using dia- logue act analysis. The machine learning experimentation produced promising results and demonstrated the possibility of practical applications of the DA analysis for further research across disciplines."
tl_etd_237,An Investigation of Racial and/or Ethnic Minority Teacher Candidates' Strengths Awareness and Utilization,Teaching and Leadership,"Racial and/or Ethnic Minority Teacher Candidates, Strengths Application, Strengths Awareness","There is a consensus among researchers that teachers from diverse linguistic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds contribute to American education (Dee, 2004; Easton-Brooks, Lewis, & Yang, 2010; Irvine, 2003; Irvine & Fenwick, 2011; Ladson-Billings, 2005; Lu, 2005; Talbert-Johnson, 2001). There is also a call for teacher educators to recognize what racial and/or ethnic minority teacher candidates bring to the teaching profession (Galindo & Olguin, 1996; Kohli, 2009; Lu, 2005; Montecinos, 2004; Oling Ottoo, 2005). Yet our knowledge about how this unique group of prospective teachers interprets and works with their own strengths is very limited. It is necessary to explore the strengths awareness of racial and/or ethnic minority teacher candidates as well as their strengths application to add to the sporadic studies in this field.The purpose of this study was to provide empirical data about how teacher candidates from diverse racial and/or ethnic minority backgrounds perceive and utilize their own strengths. Guided by the theoretical framework of the strengths-based perspective and the analytical framework of symbolic interaction, I employed semi-structured individual interviews and document analysis to collect data. The interviews reflected the personal experience and perspective of each individual participant; the document analysis provided concrete and authentic examples of how they utilized their strengths in teaching and non-teaching venues.The participants were eight minority and international pre-service teachers enrolled in formal teacher education programs from four higher education institutions in the Northeast regions in the U.S. All participants had had some field experiences by the time of their participation in this study in the summer 2010. The participants included six females and two males. Four were graduate students and four were undergraduate students. One was an international student and seven were minority students.This study uncovered a wide range of participant-identified strengths, suggesting that the participants took a ""me as a whole person"" perspective when talking about their own strengths. This study found that seven participants were able to name and describe some of their strengths without probing and one was able to do so with probing. All participants reported having applied strengths in a variety of ways professionally, and they were able to use their existing professional work samples to support their arguments. The ability to articulate their strengths seemed to relate to their strengths awareness levels. Participants who were able to name and explain their strengths in words more clearly were those who had thought about their strengths. Strengths application also seemed related to their strengths awareness levels. Those who exhibited strong strengths awareness used their strengths more consciously and consistently than those who were less aware of and/or less articulate about their strengths.This study also found the origins of some of the participants' self-identified strengths, and identified some beginnings that may lead the participants to become aware of their strengths. This study discovered several external influences and internal qualities that may encourage or discourage the participants' awareness and utilization of their strengthsLimitations of this study include the selection of the participants in formal programs in the Northeast regions only, limits inherent in the methodology and data analysis, and the possible influence of my ""insider"" status.Implications for K-12 educators, teacher preparation programs, and future research are offered."
etd_535,AN INVESTIGATION OF US AND CHINESE PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY TEACHERS’ PROBLEM POSING WHEN INTERACTING WITH PROBLEM-SOLVING ACTIVITIES,Teaching and Leadership,"Mathematical problem posing, Mathematical problem solving, Prospective elementary teachers","This study examined the patterns of problem posing shown by United States (US) and Chinese prospective elementary teachers during problem-posing processes when problem-solving activities were involved in an alternating manner. It further explored the features of the relationship between problem posing and problem solving. Data were collected by asking 32 US and 55 Chinese prospective elementary teachers to pose problems for Translating, Comprehending, Editing, and Selecting processes (Christou, Mousoulides, Pittalis, Pitta-Pantazi, & Sriraman, 2005) before a problem-solving task, and then to pose two more problems after that problem-solving task, namely, problem posing after the problem solving process. All participants completed the first set of tasks, and 43 of them completed the similarly structured second set of tasks.Participants’ posed and solved problems were quantitatively analyzed. For problem solving, the results showed that (1) 25% of the 32 US participants and 98% of the 55 Chinese participants completely solved the given problem during the first task administration, and (2) 19% of the 16 US participants and 89% of the 27 Chinese participants correctly solved the given problem during the second task administration. In their problem posing, Chinese participants posed a much higher percentage of solvable mathematical problems in the Comprehending and Selecting processes compared to their US counterparts, while their US counterparts were challenged most by these two processes. Additionally, both US and Chinese participants’ best performance in problem posing did not occur during problem posing after the problem solving process.In qualitative analysis, US and Chinese participants’ problem-posing performance shared some similar patterns regarding (1) features of posed problems, (2) capability of posing problems with creative ideas, and (3) progression of problem-posing performance throughout all five problem-posing processes. The US and Chinese participants also showed some differences during the problem-posing process as follows: (1) figure visualization; (2) calculation interpretation; (3) habitual preference of posing a sequence of problems; (4) perception of a given answer based on previously posed or solved problems; and (5) problem-posing strategy selection for integrating given information. This study further examined the features of the relationship between problem posing and problem solving. Different types of problem-posing tasks needed different amounts of problem-solving effort and they had different impacts on problem-solving performance. In addition, problem solving before problem posing had a positive influence on participants’ subsequent problem-posing performance.This study suggests recommendations for future research to understand other forms of interactions between problem posing and problem solving, explore specific impacts of cultural or academic background on problem-posing performance, and develop models or frameworks that could help problem posers overcome the difficulties involved in posed problems that were ill-structured, unsolvable, or not mathematical problems. For teacher preparation, this study advocates that prospective elementary teachers need more exposure to multiple types of problem-posing tasks, practices involving interactions between problem posing and problem solving, opportunities to work with ill-structured mathematical problems, as well as opportunities to recognize and analyze different types of mathematical problems before posing their own problems."
etd_85,Analysis of Corroded Steel Reinforced Concrete Beams,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Beam, Concete, Corrosion, Finite Element Analysis, Reinforced, Steel","This research presents a new methodology for the evaluation of the residual flexural strength of corroded reinforced concrete (CRC) beams. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model that accounts for damaged material properties and geometry was developed and verified against experimental data conducted by several researchers. The FEA model showed good agreement with experimental data. After validation against experimental data, the FEA model was used to investigate a total of 145 reinforced concrete beams that covered many variables: span to depth ratio, tensile reinforcement ratio, compressive reinforcement ratio, concrete compressive strength, length of corroded zone, and type of applied load. Based on the outcome of the above data, a detailed analytical model was developed. The analytical model was verified against experimental and FEA data conducted by the author and other researchers. The analytical model was then used to perform a parametric study to investigate the effect of the following parameters on the ultimate strength of concrete beams reinforced with steel bars:-	Span to depth ratio-	Tensile reinforcement ratio-	Compressive reinforcement ratio-	Type of applied load-	Unbonded length-	Corrosion level-	Length of corroded zone-	Spalling of concrete coverBoth the FEA and analytical models were able to predict the residual capacity of corroded RC beams.For beams with corroded tensile reinforcement, it was concluded that when the corrosion level is relatively high, the decrease in capacity is mainly because of the decrease in the steel reinforcement cross-sectional area and strength, due to corrosion, whereas the major cause of strength reduction for beams subjected to low corrosion levels is the loss of bond between steel and surrounding concrete. On the other hand, for beams with corroded compressive reinforcement, the loss of strength is primarily due to loss of concrete cover.Moreover, it was observed that when the reinforcement ratio is less than 0.35% or the length of unbond is less than 60% of the span, all beams were able to maintain their original capacity.Finally, a simplified practical analytical model was developed to allow engineers to compute the ultimate capacity of corroded RC beams subjected to different corrosion levels and lengths."

The filling media studied are uniaxial media and uniaxial media embedded with metamaterial. A literary search provides numerous methods and numerical techniques for analyzing waveguide class problems, but ultimately the Mode Matching Method (MMM) is chosen as the numerical analysis technique for this dissertation.An overview of waveguide theory and its application to the Mode Matching Method are presented. The Mode Matching Method is then used to analyze simple cases to confirm the numerical accuracy. Once accuracy is confirmed, Mode Matching theory is applied assuming the waveguides are filled with anisotropic medium. This theory is extended to uniaxial media with special orientations of the optic axis, because in practice the coordinate systems of media and waveguide do not always coincide. The Mode Matching Method with rotated optic axis is also extended to include the losses of the dielectric. This thesis also goes on to demonstrate the Mode Matching Method can accurately analyze dielectric waveguides with embedded metamaterial, specifically thin wire metamaterialsFinally two dielectric filled waveguide filters are designed using the Mode Matching Method: one filter with embedded metamaterials and one filter without metamaterials. The filters are then manufactured. The measured results are compared to the Mode Matching results and shown to have excellent agreement."

Different experts with distinct academic backgrounds look at nation branding from different angles. This paper first takes a critical review of the conceptualizations of nation branding and then revisits the public relations theories, followed by a synthesis of public relations concepts with nation branding in a case study of the Beijing 2008 Opening Ceremony. It also seeks to open a conversation within the field of communication and public relations on the trend of nation branding. With an aim of contributing to the theoretical development of nation branding, the author attempts to review classic public relations theories and seeks for possibilities to integrate public relations theories into this fast-growing field.Because nation branding is an umbrella term, the author narrows the research field to the case study of the Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony. By comparatively analyzing the commentaries of the Opening Ceremony from CCTV and Australia Seven, this study attempts to to bring the Chinese nation branding events into the lenses of image management and communication."

I then extendthis understanding into a plausible concept for implementing optical-spring-basedangular control in the Advanced LIGO detectors."
rel_etd_83,"Animal Religion: Evolution, Affect, and Radical Embodiment",Religion,"Philosophy, religion and theology, Animal religion, Radical embodiment","Animal religion explores a particular theoretical problem in theory and method in the study of religion: the relationship between religion and bodies. Where religion is often defined--in popular and academic contexts--as a belief in supernatural agents, the animal religion model suggests religion is best understood as emerging out of bodies. Animal religion can be used to understand not only instantiations of human religion, but also, building on the work of Kimberley Patton and ethologists such as Jane Goodall and Marc Bekoff, religion emerging out of nonhuman animal bodies.To set up animal religion, this dissertation adopts a particular theoretical lens: radical embodiment. Radical embodiment is an interdisciplinary approach stressing the complexity of embodied systems, drawing on resources from evolutionary biology and brain-mind science, poststructuralist philosophy and feminism, and contemporary theoretical work in religious studies. Where classical ontologies have proposed a univocal human ""nature"" and built their philosophical systems on that basis, radical embodiment, in its Joycean mood, emphasizes that bodies are actually made up of a multiplicity of interlocking, overlapping, and shifting economies, muddy bodily technologies corresponding to organs, cells, circuits, limbs, and cognitive drivers. Radical embodiment also inhabits a Proustian mood; it fuses contemporary readings of Proust from poststructuralist philosophy and religious studies with the emerging field of affective neuroscience to demonstrate that bodies are not motivated by an ensemble of rational operations, but rather by a more fundamental network of affects or emotions.Radical embodiment applied to religious studies, then, suggests that religion is a complex outgrowth of multidimensional, affectively determined bodies, not a rationally elected and cognitively streamlined set of beliefs. The dissertation closes with a series of case studies to illustrate how animal religion plays out: the Park51 controversy, New Atheism, and contemporary primatology. It closes with a study of the ""dance of awe"" discussed by Jane Goodall in her observations of chimpanzees in the Kakombe valley. Applying poststructuralist feminism to evolutionary theory, it suggests that this ""dance"" encapsulates the embodied play of forms that gives rise to religion in all animal bodies."
etd_528,Antebellum Rhetorical Education at Myrtilla Miner's School for Colored Girls: Cultural Rhetoric and Epistolary Writing at the First African American Normal School,Writing Program,"African American, Antebellum, Literacy, Pedagogy, Rhetorical Education, women","This dissertation is a rhetorical historiography that shows archival evidence of Myrtilla Miner’s School for Colored Girls, which was founded in 1851. Antebellum Rhetorical Education at Myrtilla Miner’s School for Colored Girls reflects the advanced rhetorical education and literacy practices of free colored women at the School for Colored Girls, as the first colored normal school established for free people of African descent prior to the American Civil War. This study examines recovered student compositions and epistolary forms of the free colored women as rhetorical artifacts of nineteenth-century teacher training and cultural activism. The study also provides an analysis of Myrtilla Miner’s pedagogical practices and writings, reflects the inter- and intra-cultural discourses and influence of the emerging Free Colored People’s Movement, and illuminates the social and rhetorical power of affluent white women in antebellum society, in support of the school. Under the direction Dr. Rebecca Moore Howard, this study utilizes a plural qualitative methodological approach, which includes (1) historical case studies, (2) critical rhetoric, and (3) grounded theory. The study is situated alongside scholarship from David Gold, Shirley Wilson Logan, Jessica Enoch, Jacqueline Jones Royster, and others, who add to our understanding of nineteenth-century African American rhetoric, antebellum pedagogy, and literacy practices as social and cultural activism, in the field of Rhetoric and Writing Studies.In addition, this study looks forward from the American Revolutionary War, rather than back from the Emancipation Proclamation, as well as uses the postcolonial fabrication of race in the United States or American Africanism (as Toni Morrison defines it) as a lens to examine the tensions that effected the Miner School for Colored Girls as a cultural phenomenon, despite the systematic political and social activisms that were enacted to deny free people of African descent access to the “higher branches of learning.” Supported by public discourses and United States Congressional records that state the School for Colored Girls was the first antebellum colored normal school in the United States, this dissertation reflects writing and advanced literacy as markers of American citizenship and whiteness, and signifies the artifacts as early representations of black modes of discourse (as Geneva Smitherman defines it). This study speaks to the nuances of race, gender, rhetorical activism, and marginalization, where the artifacts from the Miner School for Colored Girls are compared to and contextualize with antebellum discourses and hegemonic social/political practices on the free people of African descent’s access to and restrictions from rhetorical education, advanced literacy, and institutions of higher learning, and where the artifacts from the Miner School for Colored Girls are compared to and contextualize with antebellum discourses on access to rhetorical education and institutions of higher learning for Native Americans, White women, and free Colored people. Antebellum Rhetorical Education at Myrtilla Miner’s School for Colored Girls adds to our understanding on pre-American Civil War advanced literacy and writing practices of free people of African descent, women’s rhetoric and activism, antebellum teacher training, and the professionalization and representation of black women in the American Normal School Movement narrative."
etd_521,"APPEARANCE POLITICS, PHYSIOGNOMY, AND LEADERSHIP IMAGE: BUILDING POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IN LATE IMPERIAL AND MODERN CHINA",History,,"Exploring the role that physical appearance played in Chinese political culture, this dissertation focuses on leaders’ roles in crafting an appealing and powerful appearance.  I argue that Chinese political figures consistently used a strategy I term “appearance politics” to manipulate the construction of their physical appearance in textual, visual, and/or material media, and manage the interpretation of those physical constructions.  In so doing, they were able to claim authority, consolidate power, and pursue legitimacy.  I find evidence for the use of appearance politics in Chinese physiognomic depictions, imperial portraiture, official resume dossiers, photography, bronze statues, propaganda posters, and leadership images.  The variety of these depictions suggest the long span of my study, which stretches from the mid eighteenth to mid twentieth century.  By studying the longue durée of appearance politics, I suggest the many important ways in which physical appearance of male leaders mattered in the Chinese past.The dissertation focuses on four important moments in Chinese history when different cultures came into contact.  In these moments, technology and the standards of male beauty changed, but political figures continued to rely on the instruments of appearance politics to empower themselves.  In chapters analyzing the secret resume dossier system of the Yongzheng reign, Republican military uniform photographs, Sun Yat-sen bronze statues, and Chinese Communist Party leadership images, I argue that Chinese masculinity and male beauty standards are hybrid constructs, mixing or combining ideal physical features from different political cultures.  Chinese male elites used the instruments of appearance politics—and continue to do so—to model themselves on the ideal appearance standards of the time to build legitimacy."
etd_114,APPLICATION OF DATA FUSION TO FLUID DYNAMIC DATA,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Airfoil, Data Fusion, Fluid Dynamics, Jet Flow","In recent years, there have been improvements in the methods of obtaining fluid dynamic data, which has led to the generation of vast amounts of data. Extracting the useful information from large data sets can be a challenging task when investigating data from a single source. However, most experiments use data from multiple sources, such as particle image velocimetry (PIV), pressure sensors, acoustic measurements, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), to name a few. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each measurement technique, one can fuse the data together to improve the understanding of the problem being studied. Concepts from the data fusion community are used to combine fluid dynamic data from the different data sources. The data is fused using techniques commonly used by the fluid dynamics community, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), linear stochastic estimation (LSE), and wavelet analysis. This process can generate large quantities of data and a method of handling all of the data and the techniques in an efficient manner is required. To accomplish this, a framework was developed that is capable of tracking, storing, and, manipulating data.With the framework and techniques, data fusion can be applied. Data fusion is first applied to a synthetic data set to determine the best methods of fusing data. Data fusion was then applied to airfoil data that was obtained from PIV, CFD, and pressure to test the ideas from the synthetic data. With the knowledge gained from applying fusion to the synthetic data and airfoil data, these techniques are ultimately applied to data for a Mach 0.6 jet obtained from large-window PIV (LWPIV), time-resolved PIV (TRPIV), and pressure.Through the fusion of the different data sets, occlusion in the jet data were estimated within 6% error using a new POD based technique called Fused POD. In addition, a technique called Dynamic Gappy POD was created to fuse TRPIV and LWPIV to generate a large-window time-resolved data set. This technique had less error than other standard techniques for accomplishing this such as pressure-based stochastic estimation.The work presented in this document lays the groundwork for future applications of data fusion to fluid dynamic data. With the success of the work in this document, one can begin to apply the ideas from data fusion to other types of fluid dynamic problems, such as bluff bodies, unsteady aerodynamics, and other. These ideas could be used to help improve understanding in the field of fluid dynamics due to the current limitations of obtaining data and the need to better understand flow phenomena."
fin_etd_12,Applications of Search Theory in Finance,Finance,"Bid-ask spread, Competitive search, IPO underperformance, IPO underpricing, Market microstructure, pre-IPO market","In this dissertation, I apply two types of search based theoretical models to interpret two important issues in finance, respectively. (1)The first essay belongs to the field of corporate finance, in which a random search model is set up to describe the pre-IPO market searching and matching process between private firms with intent to sell equity in an IPO and investment banks (IB) that underwrite the issue. Our model tightly links many IPO-related phenomena such as IPO underpricing and long run underperformance under one unified searching framework. (2) The second essay is related to market microstructure, i.e. bid-ask spread, in which a competitive search model is proposed to re-interpret the existence of the market equilibrium bid-ask spread in a stylized security market, in which market dealers are in charge of posting an instantaneous bid price, investors choose whether to sell their share or not at this price. Different from the asymmetric information based explanation originated from two types of investors, our search based model emphasizes that since the market dealer provides necessary liquidity to the security market via playing such an intermediary role between actual buyers and sellers, the bid-ask spread charged thereafter should largely be justified as the compensation for the market dealer's endeavor in this process."
etd_18,Applying Curricular Filters: A Qualitative Study of High School Visual Art Teacher Perspectives and Practice of Visual Culture Art Education in the Art Classroom,Teaching and Leadership,"art education, art teacher, qualitative, secondary, visual art, visual culture","Art education theory literature advocates for an integration of visual culture into art education curriculum as a way to make meaning from the visuals within a learner's everyday life. The Visual Culture Art Education (VCAE) model is one current paradigm designed to achieve this integration by bringing visual culture elements that students are familiar with on a daily basis (e.g., advertisements, television, contemporary art, political iconography) into the art education classroom. While support for VCAE in the art education theory literature has been steadily increasing, there remains weak empirical evidence addressing the extent of its implementation. This study sought to explore teacher perspectives surrounding visual culture in their own experiences, in the art classroom, and in the design of art education curriculum. This was addressed through an emergent qualitative analysis of five high school art teachers including how their art learning experiences influence their teaching practices, their understanding of the visual culture model of art education, and the exploration of the factors that impacted the creation of their art curriculum.Findings include that teaching styles reflected teachers' own learning history, that instances of VCAE model implementation were infrequently observed, even then not with the intention of implementing the formal VCAE model, and that a disconnect from VCAE theory or practice left teachers with a lack of fluency of the VCAE model. In the absence of fluency with VCAE, traditional modes of art education curricula were employed instead. The results of this study provide recommendations for pre-service training programs, implications for future research surrounding the applications of VCAE, and suggestions for increasing art teacher professional development to bridge the gap between VCAE theory and wider practice."

An overview of wave behavior in biaxially anisotropic (or simply biaxial) media is presented. The reflection and transmission behaviors of electromagnetic waves from half-space and two-layer isotropic-biaxial interfaces are studied. The reflection and transmission coefficients are used in the formulation of eigenvector dyadic Green's functions. These Green's functions are employed in full-wave analyses of rectangular microstrip antennas printed on biaxial substrates.The general characteristics of electrically biaxially anisotropic (biaxial) media are presented including permittivity tensors, optic axes, orientation of the medium, and birefringence. After a detailed discussion of wave propagation, wave behavior at isotropic-biaxial interfaces is investigated. The reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves incident upon half-space and two-layer interfaces, at which the waves may be incident from either the isotropic region or the biaxial region, are investigated. The biaxial medium considered may be aligned with the principal coordinate system or may be arbitrarily oriented. Critical angle and Brewster angle effects are analyzed for the half-space case. Once the wave behavior is well understood, the eigenvector dyadic Green's function is presented for two-layer geometries involving isotropic and biaxially anisotropic media. The symmetrical property of the dyadic Green's function is derived and used to generate an unknown Green's function from a known Green's function for the two-layer geometry of interest. This new Green's function is used to model rectangular microstrip antennas.Following the investigation of reflection and transmission, rectangular microstrip antennas are analyzed using the eigenvector dyadic Green's function and the method of moments. Galerkin's method is used to evaluate current distributions on gap-fed dipole antennas and probe-fed patch antennas. The resulting current distributions are used to compute antenna parameters such as input impedance, resonant length and principal polarization radiation patterns. For the patch antennas, impedance bandwidth and cross-polarization patterns are also investigated. Results are presented for biaxially anisotropic substrates of varying thickness, permittivities, and orientations, providing the understanding of the complex behaviors of microstrip antennas printed on biaxially anisotropic substrates."

More specifically, it asked: 1) What do beginning literacy specialists' discourses reveal about their evolving identities?  2)  On what discourses do they draw? 3) How are situational, institutional, and societal contexts implicated?A sociocultural view that context, history, culture, discourse, power, and ideologies influence literacy, instruction, and teacher identity grounded this study.  The analysis drew on Gee's (2000) notions of identity and discourse.  It used critical discourse analysis to consider the oral and written texts produced by 10 graduate students.  Data sources included interviews, field notes, and other documents that provided details about the context in which participants were situated.These students' discourses revealed that they were somewhat (un)certain about their identities as teachers, literacy specialists, and people at an important life transition.  (Un)certainty, with parentheses, represents individuals' simultaneous uncertainty and certainty.  Participants seemed to be figuring out who they were and where they fit within these groups.  Most participants were uncertain about how their affiliations within social groups may impact their work in schools.  Yet they drew on race, class, gender, experience, and religion to measure their fit relative to others.  Their discourses included helping and deficit perspectives.  Such discourses could impede their ability to collaborate successfully with future students and colleagues and impact their overall effectiveness.This study provides new insights about aspiring literacy specialists' identities and discourses at an important transitional juncture.  At this point, as certified teachers, they were completing advanced studies to earn additional certification as literacy specialists.  These insights seem important given that (un)certainty, if left unaddressed, could result in negative identity constructions and continued reliance on deficit positioning, yielding lower quality instruction.  The findings have implications for educators and researchers involved in designing literacy teacher education and ongoing professional development.  It suggests teacher education may be an important context for offering support to teachers as they consider and critique the discourses they bring to their teaching and/or literacy specialist selves.

Focused on films which examine topics of wide concern in the years following World War II, the dissertation argues that social problem films function as ""assertive fictions"" to make claims about the extrafilmic world to diverse audiences, who in turn recognize these assertions at work in the films and respond to them in active, engaged ways. After a theoretical introduction discussing the stakes of treating social problem films as assertive fictions, each chapter examines a different cycle within the genre.The first chapter examines films about returning World War II veterans, arguing that such films made a variety of assertions about the way in which veterans could reintegrate into society after the war, about the origins of mental illness in veterans, and about how the disabled could adapt to the physical and social world. The second chapter turns to examine the relationship of semidocumentary detective films to discourses of scientific policing, public health, and urban planning in the postwar period, arguing that such films draw upon a ""rhetoric of generalizable specificity"" in order to make claims of broad applicability through the individuating medium of narrative cinema. Chapter three looks at reception practices of ""race problem"" films in the African American press, finding a variety of sophisticated practices for engaging with social problem films and contesting their arguments employed by writers in the press. Chapter four focuses on the reception of labor films Salt of the Earth and On the Waterfront in Communist periodicals, demonstrating the way in which a particular set of concepts emerged over time in critical writing in the press and came to be applied to the films."

A sequential explanatory mixed methods approach, using a series of weekly self-report checklists about teachers’ assessment practices and semi-structured interviews, was used to address the following: (a) what assessment practices secondary ELA teachers use; (b) how these teachers determine what assessment practices to use and when to use them; (c) what these teachers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of the assessment practices that they use are; and (d) how teachers determine the effectiveness of their assessment practices. For the purposes of this research, there was a focus on three major underlying elements of FA: questioning, discussion, and feedback. This study was conducted with seven experienced high school ELA teachers that were instructors in a concurrent enrollment program. The results suggested that the overall use of and thinking about assessment practices in a secondary ELA context aligns with prior FA research in other content areas, although the practices reported as used in this study seemed to be more targeted to individual students and their learning needs. In addition, the findings showed that there were statistically significant differences in the practices that the participants used from week to week with their students. There were also statistically significant differences in teachers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of the assessment practices that they reported using with their lower-, average-, and higher-performing students. These results suggest that the instruments and methods used for this study are a viable approach to examining FA in a secondary ELA context, but additional research is needed into the reliability and validity of these approaches with other populations."

A growing concern is how evaluation of teaching has been affected by gender biasesthroughout the reviewing process. However, pinpointing the exact causes and consequen-tial effects of this form of gender inequality has been a hard task.Current work focusses on university-wide student reviewing system, that depends onobjective responses on a Likert scale to measure various aspects of an instructor’s qual-ity. Through our work, we access online student review data which are not limited bygeographies, universities, or disciplines.Thereafter, we come up with a systematic approach to assess the various ways in whichgender inequality is apparent from the student reviews. We also suggest a possible wayin which bias related to the gender of a professor could be detected from both objectivenumerical measures and subjective opinions in reviews. Finally, we assess a logistic re-gression learning algorithm to find the most important factors that can help in identifyinggender inequality."
etd_282,Assessing motor and cognitive function to detect shifts in brain function in two models of Parkinson's disease,Biology,,"Cognitive changes accompany and often precede the onset of classic motor deficits typical of Parkinson&;#8217;s disease. A current focus of Parkinson&;#8217;s research has become understanding the development and progression of pre-motor cognitive changes. Based on previous research showing that hippocampus-sensitive spatial learning can be enhanced at the cost of impaired striatum-sensitive response learning, we hypothesized that changes in the balance between these two cognitive systems could be used as a proxy for the relative strength or health of their associated brain regions. Because non-motor symptoms of Parkinson&;#8217;s disease can precede the onset of the diagnostic motor dysfunction, changes in the balance between distinct learning strategies may represent an early marker of Parkinson’s-related neurodegeneration. Two rat models were used to assess the relationship between Parkinson’s disease-related motor dysfunction and changes in cognition. In the first study, a 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson’s disease was used to generate a partial lesion of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Despite the probable depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway of lesioned rats that presented as impairment in two motor tasks, rats showed enhanced performance on the cognitive spontaneous alternation task, a test of spatial working memory. However, recent data suggest that multiple brain regions, including both the hippocampus and striatum, are activated during performance of the spontaneous alternation task; Parkinson’s-induced enhancements on this task may not be due solely to a shift in cognitive balance. Previous data show that inactivation of the hippocampus can enhance striatum-sensitive learning; however, it is unclear if inactivation of the striatum enhances hippocampus-sensitive functions. Prior to determining the effect of a 6-OHDA-induced lesion on hippocampus-sensitive learning, we wanted first to assess how impairing striatum function modulated place learning to determine cognitive shifts in rats with an intact brain. The second study uses two single-solution cognitive tasks that may link more closely to activation of separate neural systems. Temporary inhibition of the dorsal striatum by the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, produced deficits in motor function similar to those seen in the 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s. Intrastriatal muscimol also impaired learning on a striatum-sensitive response learning task, suggesting that striatum-sensitive motor processes may overlap with striatum-sensitive cognitive processes. However, muscimol-induced striatum dysregulation did not produce enhancements on a hippocampus-sensitive spatial learning task. It is possible that the cognitive enhancements in hippocampus-sensitive processes are maximized when only specific neurotransmitter systems are dampened, such as the loss of dopaminergic signaling seen in Parkinson’s disease. Unlike 6-OHDA, which targets dopaminergic neurons, muscimol activates GABAA receptors, leading to the opening of Cl- channels, altering membrane potentials, and changing the likelihood of neurotransmitter release. Thus, activation of GABAA receptors by muscimol will alter neuron activity regardless of neurotransmitter system while 6-OHDA must initially affect dopaminergic neurons. Consequently, it is possible that muscimol decreases activity in neurotransmitter systems that play a compensatory role following 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic degeneration. As such, a generalized inhibitor of neural activity like muscimol, may disrupt neural processes that are integral for seeing the Parkinson’s disease-related cognitive enhancements."
etd_481,"Assessing the contribution of geography and host use to genetic structure in New York populations of the parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi",Biology,"Aphidius ervi, biocontrol, HAD, microsatellites","Host-associated differentiation (HAD) has been shown to be important in generating genetic differentiation within herbivorous insects, but the applicability of HAD to other parasitic taxonomic groups remains unclear. For example, parasitoid wasps that attack herbivorous insects share many similar life habits with their hosts, suggesting that HAD may also be a prevalent and important mechanism in this group. I tested for the genetic signature of HAD in the parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi, that attacks aphids. Aphidius ervi is a biocontrol agent that uses many species of pest aphids including the clover and alfalfa host-races of the pea aphid (Acyrthospihon pisum). The pea aphid host races differ in their defenses and resource quality as hosts for A. ervi. I assessed allelic variation from six microsatellite loci across sixteen A. ervi populations along a 200 km transect in New York State to examine genetic structure in relation to pea aphid host race use. Results from AMOVA and pairwise FST analyses indicated that there is no genetic structure in A. ervi due to HAD, and there was no genetic structure across the sampled range. These findings suggest that A. ervi populations are connected by high levels of gene flow that likely swamp out selection for specialization on the pea aphid host races of A. ervi. At least for A. ervi, the spatiotemporal distribution of hosts as well as the high dispersal rate suggest that HAD is unlikely to be a mechanism of genetic differentiation among populations."
etd_397,Assessing the Quantified Impact of a Hybrid POGIL Methodology on Student Averages in a Forensic Science Survey Course,Science Teaching,"active learning, forensic science, POGIL","A causal-comparative/quasi experimental study examined the effect of incorporating a hybrid teaching methodology that blended lecture with Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Lessons (POGILs) on the overall academic achievement of a diverse student body in a large lecture setting. Additional considerations included student gender, ethnicity, declared major (STEM or non-STEM), and SAT scores. An evaluation of the effect that these characteristics had on student achievement due to differentiating import placed on the use of POGILs as a learning tool was included. This study used data obtained from a longitudinal examination of eight years of student data from an introductory forensic science survey course offered in a R1 northeastern university.This study addressed the effectiveness of applying a proscribed active learning methodology, one proposed effective in collegiate education, to a new environment, forensic science. The methodology employed combined fourteen POGILs, created specifically for the chosen course, with didactic lecture during the entire semester of a forensic science survey course. This quasi-experimental design used the manipulation of the independent variable, the use of a hybrid lecture instead of exclusive use of traditional didactic lectures, on the students’ academic achievement on exams given during the course.Participants in this study (N=1436) were undergraduate students enrolled in the single semester introductory science course. A longitudinal study that incorporated eight years of data was completed, 4 years pre-intervention (2007-2010) and 4 years post-intervention (2011-2014). The forensic science survey course, taught by only one professor during the eight-year period, was a science discipline that had yet to integrate an active learning educational model.Findings indicate four variables significantly contributed to explaining nearly 28% of the variation seen in the student class averages earned during the eight-year period: the intervention, gender, STEM majors, and SAT scores. On average, the intervention significantly altered exam scores, F (1, 1431) = 43.019, p < 0.000, R2 = 0.029, raising exam averages 3.1%. Within the population, females outperformed their male counterparts by 1.9%, although both genders were significantly affected by the intervention, F (1, 1431) = 13.698, p < 0.000, R2 = 0.009. Students with declared majors in the STEM fields outperformed the non-STEM fields by 5.6%, a strong factor in the model, F (1, 1431) = 91.918, p < 0.000, R2 = 0.060, with both STEM and non-STEM students being positively affected by the intervention. The SAT scores, however, showed the strongest effect, F (1, 1431) = 345.026, p < 0.000, R2 = 0.179, where an increase of 3.1% in the student class averages could be seen for every 100 points earned on the SATs. Further discussions include implications and correlations to recent research and directions for future research."
etd_118,Assessment of Cognitive Abilities and Reading Comprehension Across School-Age Development:  A Meta-Analysis,Child and Family Studies,"Child development, Cognitive abilities, Reading comprehension","The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of specific cognitive abilities and reading comprehension across a variety of norm referenced tests that align with Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities and integrative models of reading.  Data from existing studies was analyzed by comparing the relationships of four specific cognitive abilities/processes; Comprehension-Knowledge (Gc), reading decoding, rapid automatic naming (RAN), and verbal short-term/working memory on the outcome of reading comprehension across two grade groups, 1-3 and 4-10. This synthesis of past research was conducted via meta-analysis of 67 independent samples from 50 studies conducted in the United States between 1998 and 2013 examining the correlations between the variables of interest.  Meta-regression was conducted using the variable age as a predictor of effect size for both ""Lower Order Processing"" skills, comprised of reading decoding and RAN, and ""Higher Order Processing"" skills, comprised of Gc and short-term/working memory.  Other potential moderating variables; socioeconomic status, educational status, and reading comprehension assessment type, were also examined.  The results indicate overall large effect sizes (r = 0.55) for Gc and reading comprehension, as well as (r = 0.69) for reading decoding and reading comprehension.  Results also indicate moderate effect sizes (r = 0.35) and (r = 0.41) for RAN and short-term/working memory and reading comprehension, respectively.  When examining a variety of different standardized measures purporting to assess the same general constructs, partial support for integrative models of reading was found for age as a significant predictor for ""Higher Order Processing skills"" as increases in effect size of these processes and reading comprehension increased with age. The examination of potential moderator variables revealed that the type of response format of the reading comprehension measures was significantly different for ""Lower Order Processing"" skills when comparing cloze procedure and multiple-choice formats.  Implications for applied practice are discussed."
etd_581,Assessment of Tongue Position and Laryngeal Height in Two Professional Voice Populations,Communication Sciences and Disorders,"hyoid, lingual positioning, singers, speech pathology, ultrasonography, voice","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to advance our current knowledge of singer physiology by using ultrasonography in combination with acoustic measures to compare physiological differences between musical theater and opera singers under controlled phonation conditions. Furthering our understanding of singing physiology is important for determining proper technique for training specific singing styles, and for guidance in the prevention and treatment of voice injury. The primary objectives addressed in this study were: 1) To determine if differences in hyolaryngeal and vocal fold contact dynamics occur between two professional voice populations (musical theater and opera) during singing tasks, and 2) To determine if differences occur between musical theater and opera singers in oral configuration and associated acoustic resonance during singing tasks.Method: Twenty-one singers (10 musical theater; 11 opera) were included in this study. All participants were currently enrolled in a music program for at least two semesters. Experimental procedures consisted of sustained phonation on the vowels /i/ and /?/ during both a low-pitch and high-pitch tasks. Measures of hyolaryngeal elevation, tongue height, and tongue advancement were assessed using ultrasonography. Vocal fold contact dynamics were measured using electroglottography. Simultaneous acoustic recordings were obtained during all ultrasonography procedures for analysis of the first two formant frequencies.Results: Significant oral configuration differences, as reflected by measures of tongue height and tongue advancement, were seen between the singing groups. Measures of acoustic resonance also showed significant differences between singing groups during specific tasks. Hyoid elevation was not statistically different between groups, however a trend towards higher hyoid positioning during selected tasks was observed for the musical theater group relative to the opera group.Vocal-fold contact dynamics were not different between groups, though musical theater singers did display slightly higher contact quotient values compared to the opera singers.Conclusions: These findings suggest that musical theater singers alter their laryngeal and lingual structures differently than opera singers under certain controlled conditions. Because singers are at such a high risk of developing a voice disorder, understanding how these two groups of singers manipulate their laryngeal physiology may improve identification of negative vocal behaviors and serve as a preventative step in vocal hygiene."
etd_543,Associations between Pain Intensity and Urge to Smoke: Testing the Role of Negative Affect and Pain Catastrophizing,Psychology,"negative affect, nicotine, pain, pain catastrophizing, smoking urge, tobacco","Urge to smoke tobacco is a critical aspect of tobacco dependence, and there is evidence of covariation between pain intensity and self-reported urge to smoke. However, direct tests of this association have relied almost exclusively on clinical pain samples or experimental paradigms. The goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis that current pain intensity would be positively associated with self-reported urge to smoke, among a sample of daily cigarette smokers who were recruited from the local community and excluded if they endorsed current chronic pain. We also sought to examine the role of negative affect and conduct the first test of pain catastrophizing in relations between pain intensity and urge to smoke tobacco. Participants (N = 229, 42.4% Female, 38.9% black/African American, Mcpd = 21.9) were recruited for a laboratory study of pain and smoking, and these data were collected at the baseline session. Consistent with expectation, current pain intensity was positively associated with total urge to smoke (ps < .05), and urge to smoke for the relief of negative affect (ps < .05). We further observed an indirect association via state negative affect, such that pain intensity was positively associated with negative affect, which in turn was associated with greater urge to smoke scores (ps < .05). Pain catastrophizing was found to be a significant moderator, such that positive associations between pain intensity and urge to smoke were only evident among smokers who endorsed low levels of catastrophizing (ps < .05). These findings contribute to an emerging literature indicating that pain and related constructs are relevant to the maintenance of tobacco smoking. Future research should examine how pain-relevant cognitive-affective factors may influence associations between the experience of pain and motivation to smoke tobacco cigarettes."
etd_541,Associations of Alcohol-Facilitating and Stressful Environments with Alcohol Behaviors in Black College Students: Moderation by ADH1B*3 and Religiosity,Psychology,"ADH1B*3, alcohol, alcohol offers, Black college students, peer norms, racial discrimination","Alcohol behaviors among Black college students may be explained by the interactive role of multiple risk and protective factors. Emerging evidence shows that the association of risky environments and drinking behaviors differs as a function of alcohol-metabolizing genotypes. However, studies have yet to examine the protective role of ADH1B*3, an alcohol-metabolizing gene found almost exclusively among Black individuals. In addition to genetic protective factors, religiosity has been identified as a protective psychosocial factor against alcohol use, despite exposure to risky environments.  The current study examined the potential protective effects of the ADH1B*3 allele and religiosity on the relationship between risky environments and alcohol behaviors among Black college students. Specifically, this study sought to investigate the extent to which those genetic and psychosocial factors attenuate the association of alcohol-facilitating (i.e., alcohol offers and perceived peer norms) and stressful (i.e., racial discrimination and negative life events) environmental factors with alcohol behaviors. Participants were 241 Black college students (mean age = 20 years; 66% female) who reported consuming alcohol at least once in the past 30 days.  Results demonstrated that the presence of an ADH1B*3 allele protects against alcohol use frequency when exposed to low alcohol offers and racial discrimination (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.14, 1.24, respectively), and negative drinking consequences when exposed to low alcohol offers and perceived peer drinking norms (IRR = 1.21, 1.41, respectively). Religiosity was shown to protect against alcohol use frequency in the presence of low racial discrimination (IRR = 1.10). These novel findings add to the scarce literature of risky and protective determinants of alcohol behaviors among Black college students."
psy_etd_179,Associative Processes in Statistical Learning: Paradoxical Predictions of the Past,Psychology,"episodic memory, linguistics, sequence learning, serial reaction time task, statistical learning, temporal contiguity","The ability to process sequences of input and extract regularity across the distribution of input is fundamental for making predictions from the observed past to the future. Prediction is rooted in the extraction of both frequency- and conditional statistics from the distribution of inputs. For example, an animal hunting for food may consistently return to a particular area to hunt if relative to all other areas visited, that area has the highest frequency of prey. In contrast, humans asked to predict the next word in a sentence must make a prediction based upon higher-order regularities rather than simple frequency statistics (the most frequent word in the English language is the). The Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task, a model for studying sequential behavior, is used to quantify sensitivity to sequential constraints present in structured environments (Nissen & Bullemer, 1987). The SRT task requires Ss to make a unique response to each individually presented element from a sequence of elements. The statistics of SRT sequences, such as the relative frequency of elements and simple pairwise associations between elements, can be controlled to create dependencies that can only be predicted by learning higher-order associations.Sensitivity to the sequential constraints present in the structured input is demonstrated through differences in reaction time to elements that are, and are not, predictable based upon the statistics of the input environment. Sensitivity to statistical regularity in the environment is also a critical dimension of various episodic learning methodologies. Graded associations have been demonstrated among elements extending in both forward and backward directions in episodic memory tasks, and are suggested to reflect a gradient of the underlying structural relationships among the study elements. Graded associations are beneficial to the extent that they increase the probability of recalling sequence elements.However, unlike free and serial recall tasks, backward associations, and remote associations in general, are anti-predictive in the SRT task. The formation of associations beyond the immediately predictive element in prediction tasks could be suggestive of a ubiquitous underlying associative mechanism, which universally gives rise to graded contiguity effects, regardless of the specifc application (Howard, Jing, Rao, Provyn, & Datey, 2009). The following experiment employed a probabilistic SRT task to quantify sensitivity to immediately backward, backward-remote, and forward-remote associations. Ss were presented sequences of elements probabilistically sampled from an underlying ring-structure, with the dependent measure Ss' reaction time to elements that either followed, or deviated from, the structure. Results from the SRT task indicated that Ss demonstrated a robust backward association, as well as evidence for forward-graded associations. Moreover, in an explicit test of sequence knowledge, while Ss did not generate the probabilistic statistics from the structured learning environment, Ss did generate a statistically signifcant amount of backward-transitions, relative to other remote-backward transitions. The graded associations that were formed beyond the immediately predictive element in the prediction task provide evidence that a similar mechanism that mediates episodic learning may also mediate statistical learning. Backward and graded associations may be explained by a ubiquitous underlying associative mechanism, which universally gives rise to graded contiguity effects, regardless of the specific application."

Excavations were undertaken from October 2012 to July 2013 in an abandoned tenantry, Below Cliff, on the east coast of the island, once inhabited by dozens of families locally referred to as the ""poor whites"" or ""Redlegs"", said to be the descendants of seventeenth century European indentured servants. Combining archaeological, ethnographic, and historical methodologies, this dissertation explores class relations of Below Cliff residents to processes of capitalism as well as other island laborers, including Afro-Barbadians. Additionally, racial categories are interrogated through an analysis of complex and interracial genealogies of Below Cliff residents that call into question the legitimacy of determinate racial categories of black and white. I argue that Below Cliff is best understood as an alternative modernity, a place in which residents were directly affected by processes of modernization, but through their own ways of relating to economic forces and their own experiences of race relations they were able to engender alternatives to modernity that were all their own."

etd_191,Attunements to the Good Life: Religious Joy and the Critique of Eudaemonism in the Writings of Søren Kierkegaard,Religion,"Bildung, Ethics, Eudaimonism, Happiness, Humor, Joy","Kierkegaard has often been accused of anti-eudaemonism, but the meaning of this claim is too often allowed to remain ambiguous. By interpreting Kierkegaard's texts with attention to philological details, rhetorical effect, and their relationship to modern writers such as Spinoza, Kant, Lessing, Shaftesbury, Schopenhauer, and Martensen, I analyze Kierkegaard's critique of eudaemonism and explicate his joyous alternative. Specifically, I argue that Kierkegaard does not critique eudaemonism primarily as a structural egoism inherent in certain ethical systems, but more broadly as a closure of the self to the goodness of that which lies beyond its grasp. Kierkegaard's understanding of eudaemonism is thus counter-intuitive. While eudaemonism is often thought of as a kind of worldliness, in Kierkegaard's texts eudaemonism is portrayed as not worldly enough. After surveying the various forms of the self's eudaemonistic enclosure, I turn to the role of the comic in cultivating religious joy. I then analyze texts Kierkegaard published from 1847 through 1849, where, in place of eudaemonism, he proffers a religious joy that can joyfully embrace the tragic. I interpret these texts through the lens of Kierkegaard's relation to the tradition of cultivation (Bildung) and his notes on Spinoza's Ethics."

I use three proxies to measure the business risk of corruption: presence of a company's' subsidiaries in countries perceived as more corrupt, according to the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index; presence of a peer firm that is charged with violating the provisions of the FCPA; and the presence of a company's subsidiaries in countries perceived as tax havens. Using an OLS audit-fee model, I find that auditors incorporate the above mentioned business risks in audit fees, and charge a premium in audit fees to companies operating in countries perceived as more corrupt, to peers of a firm charged with FCPA violations, and to companies operating in tax havens. This study contributes to the literature on audit fees by empirically studying the FCPA period data to identify the risk of being corrupt as a business risk that is a distinct determinant of audit fees, over and above other known determinants of audit fees. In addition, it also highlights the first order effects of tax havens on audit fees. Further, this study contributes to the literature on regulation by identifying the unintended spillover costs of FCPA enforcement on peer companies. Lastly, it contributes to the literature on corruption and tax havens by identifying additional costs associated with them."
etd_298,"Audit, Accountability and Commitment: School Business Officials' Perceptions of an Audit Regime",Social Sciences,"auditing, New York, organizational commitment, public policy, school business officials","Prior research has suggested that models intended to explain the organizational commitment of public employees have not accounted for the substantial and often intense external controls imposed on public organizations. A public scandal involving corruption and mismanagement in a New York State public school district resulted in the state legislature implementing a program of reforms intended to increase the financial accountability of public school districts. The aim of this exploratory, multi-subject qualitative study is to gain insight about how financial managers in public school districts experienced the reform and think about external controls that feature an extensive regimen of auditing. According to the ten school business officials that participated in the study, the accountability demands produced by the reform have affected their work environment in tangible ways. Data from structured interviews with the study participants revealed a) how they entered and became established in the school business career field, b) how participants assess the utility of the reform elements, and c) the participants' strategies for survival in the post-reform environment. The participants: generally prepared for a career in business and entered the occupation through the civil service; have varying opinions about the utility and appropriateness of the reform elements; and consistently agree that over the ten years since the reform legislation was passed, the audit regime has produced little benefit relative to its cost, yet has been a major factor in creating an environment that is substantially more difficult for school business officials to survive in. Of particular interest for this project was elaborating on the mechanisms by which external controls affect the psychological attachments that bind public sector financial managers to their organizations. The study findings generally support the view that a public financial manager's organizational commitment is a function of their perceptual constructions of the job autonomy and supervisor support that they enjoy. Reputation, which is moderated by exposure in the news media, also appears to be an important factor."

Extracting the original intent of an application from its application bundle, whether to perform a security analysis on it, to search for security flaws(or bugs) or simply for educational purposes is a key requirement for the security community. With the fluidity provided by the Android app store coupled with a complete application-framework based environment for a malicious user to employ as an attack space, it is of great importance to examine Android applications and extract their intent.For basic applications, simple reverse engineering tools can be used to extract a semantic view of the application very close to the original source code of the application. However for applications, which have been deliberately packaged/packed in such a way that their original intent cannot be extracted by simply reverse-engineering them, we need a more intricate procedure to extract enough information to be able to reproduce the original intent of the application. These applications are packaged such that the actual code is hidden/encrypted and only during run-time is the actual code unpacked and executed.To unpack such applications, we present DroidUnpack, a tool based on dynamic program analysis, which is able to extract the original intent of the application, generically. DroidUnpack is designed by exploiting some fundamental features of the Android Runtime which cannot be mutated by a malicious user to unpack the application. We also attempts to alleviate tedious manual analysis required by a user to analyze different types of packed applications, by providing a generalized tool which is able to unpack android applications, regardless of the packing technique used."
etd_717,"Bacterial polymertropism, the response to strain-induced alignment of polymers",Biology,"Biofilms, Elasticotaxis, Mechanosensing, Motility","In nature, bacteria often live in surface-associated communities known as biofilms. Biofilm-forming bacteria deposit a layer of polysaccharide on the surfaces they inhabit; hence, polysaccharide is their immediate environment on any surface. In this study, we examined how the physical characteristics of polysaccharide substrates influence the behavior of the biofilm-forming bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. M. xanthus colonies, and indeed those of the majority of biofilm-forming species tested, respond to the compression-induced deformation of polysaccharide substrates by preferentially spreading across the surface perpendicular to the axis of compression. This response is conserved across multiple distantly related phyla and is found in species with an array of distinct motility apparatuses.The birefringence and small angle X-ray scattering patterns of compressed polysaccharide substrates indicate that the directed surface movements of these bacteria consistently match the orientation of the long axes of aligned and tightly packed polysaccharide fibers in compressed substrates. Therefore, we refer to this behavior as polymertropism to denote that the directed movements are a response to the physical arrangement of the change in packing and alignment of the polymers in the substrate. In addition to altering the colony morphology we find the behavior of groups of cells, called flares, is also affected in several species resulting in increased flare speed, duration, and displacement on compressed gel substrates.We suggest that polymertropism, which requires a downward-facing motility apparatus in M. xanthus, may be responsible for the observed tendency of bacterial cells to follow trails of extruded and presumably aligned polysaccharides, which their neighbors secrete and deposit on the substrate as they move across it. Polymertropism may also play a role in the organization of bacteria in a biofilm, as the iterative process of polysaccharide trail deposition and following is proposed to yield aggregates of cells."

The agility of the Internet architecture and its simplicity of use have been the engines of its growth and success with the users worldwide. As it turns out, there lies also its crux. In effect, Internet industry participants have argued that the critical problem business is faced with on the Internet is the absence of an identity layer from the core protocols of its logical infrastructure.

This dissertation is an investigation of the steps being taken by Internet stakeholders in order to resolve its identity problems, through the lenses of historical instances where similar challenges were tackled by social actors.Social science research addressing the Internet identity issues is barely nascent. Research on identification systems in general is either characterized by a paucity of historical perspective, or scantily references digital technology and online identification processes. This research is designed to bridge that gap. The general question at its core is: How do social actors, events or processes enable the historical emergence of authoritative identity credentials for the public at large? This work is guided by that line of inquiry through three broad historical case studies: first, the medieval experience with seals used as identity tokens in the signing of deeds that resulted in transfers of rights, particularly estate rights; second, comes the modern, national state with its claim to the right to know all individuals on its territory through credentials such as the passport or the national identity card; and finally, viewed from the United States, the case of ongoing efforts to build an online digital identity infrastructure.Following a process-tracing approach to historical case study, this inquiry presents enlightening connections between the three identity frameworks while further characterizing each. We understand how the medieval doctrines of the Trinity and the Eucharist developed by schoolmen within the Church accommodated seals as markers of identity, and we understand how the modern state seized on the term `nationality' - which emerged as late as in the 19th century - to make it into a legal fiction that was critical for its identification project. Furthermore, this investigation brings analytical insights which enable us to locate the dynamics driving the emergence of those identity systems. An ordering of the contributing factors in sequential categories is proposed in a sociohistorical approach to explain the causal mechanisms at work across these large phenomena. Finally this research also proposes historically informed projections of scenarios as possible pathways to the realization of authoritative digital identity. But that is the beginning of yet another story of identity."
etd_306,"BETTER OFF AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF UNIVERSAL LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE SYSTEMS? A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF GERMANY, JAPAN, AND KOREA",Public Administration,"Germany, Japan, Korea, long term care, policy effect, subjective wellbeing","Industrialized societies face unprecedented growth of their aging populations, and therefore a drastically increasing need for long-term care (LTC). Unlike acute care LTC continues for a long time-usually at least six months-and recipients of LTC do not know how long or how intensively they will need physical help with activities of daily living such as eating, dressing, and bathing and instrumental activities of daily living such as shopping, housekeeping and preparing food.Germany, Japan, and Korea, after recognizing the limitations of existing social assistance programs and national health insurance systems, each took a social insurance approach and created a dedicated fund for financing LTC. The long-term care insurance (LTCI) of the three countries aims to help people who need LTC and their families, while prioritizing home and community care over institutional care. Still, there are differences in the approaches taken by the three countries. German LTCI uses various incentives to maximize family care. For example, German LTCI pays a pension premium to the family caregiver of a home-care beneficiary's choice and the cost of employing a substitute formal caregiver when the family caregiver leaves on vacation. The Japanese and Korean LTCI lack this kind of direct support for family caregivers, providing benefits in the form of services instead of cash.This study focuses on two research questions: (a) Did the introduction of the social LTCI improve the subjective well-being (SWB) of the LTC needy and their families in Germany, Japan, and Korea? (b) How did those effects on SWB change over time? This research is motivated by academic curiosity about whether the policies in question affected the well-being of the target groups in a positive way as intended. To pursue these research questions I took a regression-based approach employing secondary data from each country. Though one could argue whether SWB should be used as an official evaluative measure, I have chosen to look at SWB because the policies of the three countries are intended to improve it. I have used various satisfaction measures, including life satisfaction, to operationalize the SWB concept in the research.Generally, social LTCI affected the SWB of the LTC needy positively-or at least non-negatively-immediately after program implementation in all three countries. The positive response of the LTC needy only lasted three or four years after LTCI implementation in Germany and Korea. Neither positive nor negative effects of LTCI on the LTC needy were observed in Japan. The effect on families of people needing LTC was quite different. German families of the LTC needy reported improved well-being in the post-LTCI period, especially in terms of income. Meanwhile, the well-being of Korean families did not show any differences after LTCI implementation. Due to the data limitation, the effect of LTCI on the Japanese families of the LTC needy was not investigated in this research. Different responses of families of the LTC needy seem to be related to the different designs of LTCI policies in each country, especially whether they incentivized family care. This research could help inform decisions about when and how these policies need to be revised in order to maintain a positive influence on the well-being of the target groups."
etd_266,Beyond “Data Thrifting”: An Investigation of Factors Influencing Research Data Reuse In the Social Sciences,School of Information Studies,"Cyberinfrastructure, Data Reuse, eScience, Open Science, Research Data, Scholarly Communication","The development of e-Research infrastructure has enabled data to be shared and accessed more openly. Policy mandates for data sharing have contributed to the increasing availability of research data through data repositories, which create favorable conditions for the reuse of data for purposes not always anticipated by original collectors. Despite the current efforts to promote transparency and reproducibility in science, data reuse cannot be assumed, nor merely considered a “thrifting” activity where scientists shop around in data repositories considering only the ease of access to data.This research was driven by three main questions: 1) What are the factors that influence scientists’ research data reuse? 2) To what degree do these factors influence scientists’ research data reuse? and 3) To what extent do scientists reuse research data? Following a sequential mixed-method approach, this study sought to provide a more nuanced view of the underlying factors that affect social scientists’ intentions to reuse data, as well as the impact of these factors on the actual reuse of data.Findings from a preliminary small-scale exploratory study with 13 social scientists produced 25 factors that were found to influence their perceptions and experiences, including both their unsuccessful and successful attempts to reuse data. These factors were grouped into six theoretical variables: perceived benefits, perceived risks, perceived effort, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived reusability.  The variables were articulated in a conceptual model drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) in order to examining social scientists’ intentions and behaviors towards the reuse of research data. The proposed hierarchical component model and the research hypotheses were validated through a survey, which was distributed to 4,500 social scientists randomly selected from the  Pivot/Community of Science (CoS) database.A total of 743 social scientists participated in the survey, of which 564 cases were included in the analysis. The survey data were analyzed using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, and supplemented by ad-hoc group comparison analyses. Survey results demonstrated that social scientists’ data reuse intention and reuse behavior were indeed influenced by different factors beyond frugality. More specifically, the more practical and social benefits social scientists perceive from reusing research data, the more likely they intended to reuse data. Similarly, peer and disciplinary influence had a positive effect on social scientists’ intention to reuse data collected/produced by others. On the contrary, the construct perceived risks was found to negatively influence social scientists’ intention to reuse existing research data collected by others. Facilitating conditions and intention to reuse were found to positively correlate to actual data reuse behavior. Perceived effort was found not statistically significant, indicating that reusing data from others did not involve as much effort as collecting/producing primary data. Perceived reusability failed to be measured, due to the lack of convergent validity. Ad-hoc group comparison tests found that intention and data reuse behavior depended on sub-disciplines’ traditions and the methodological approach social scientists followed.The findings of this research provide an in-depth understanding about the reuse of research data in the context of open science, and provide a collection of factors that influence social scientists’ decisions to reuse research data collected by others. Additionally, they update our knowledge of data reuse behavior and contribute to the body of data reuse literature by establishing a conceptual model that can be validated by future research. In terms of practice, it offers recommendations for policy makers, data scientists, and stakeholders from data repositories on defining strategies and initiatives to leverage data reuse and make publicly available data more actionable."
etd_242,Beyond Able-Minded Citizenship: Embracing Intellectual Ability Differences in Democratic Education,Cultural Foundations of Education,"Citizenship, Civic participation, Inclusion, Intellectual disability, Political agency","Within philosophical literature on democratic education, philosophers of education embrace the existence of cultural, religious, racial, gender, and other social differences as important to a thriving democracy. However, they frequently ignore or marginalize the potential significance of ability differences, especially those associated with intellect and reasoning ability. In fact, prevailing understandings of civic engagement within political philosophy, social and educational policy, and institutional practice conform to norms of development, behavior, and civic contribution that assume the presence of able-bodied and able-minded individuals. There is therefore an unchallenged assumption that those who experience significant difficulties in reasoning are unable to perform the tasks of citizenship. My dissertation investigates and challenges this assumption. I consider how the recognition of existent intellectual ability differences alters our philosophical theorizing about democratic education and suggests the need for alternative frameworks of democratic participation and the education that supports it. I propose that individuals' existent variability in intellectual processing, communicative modes, and behavior should guide our reasoning about what is required for civic participation. My view places demands on educational policy, schooling practices, and teacher education to re-examine curricula, teaching practice, school-community partnerships and, importantly, ideas about how civic knowledge is acquired and put into practice in light of varying abilities. Answering the question of whether individuals with intellectual disabilities are owed an education that prepares them to participate in democratic citizenship not only concerns the extent to which we embrace differences of ability within education in general, but also hinges on whether a just society can be one that does not enable the civic contribution of those with significant disabilities."
etd_319,Beyond Standard Model Physics under the ground and in the sky,Physics,"Beyond Standard Model, Cosmological Constant, Dark Matter, Electroweak symmetry breaking, Higgs Decays, Top partner","Cosmology and particle physics are in an exciting data-rich era, with several collider and astronomical searches underway. In this dissertation, we have explored some problems which are not addressed by the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. The implications of the Higgs discovery and lack of new physics results are far reaching. To better understand the nature of Higgs and its connections to electroweak symmetry breaking, we have performed a model independent study of spin-1 contributions in gauge extensions of Standard model. The null results of all low energy supersymmetric searches has lead to the development of Split SUSY models which are based only on gauge unification and dark  matter as guiding principles. We study in detail the cosmic probes of Split SUSY using indirect dark matter detection constraints and hints of small tensor to scalar ratio. We also investigate the phenomenological viability of models with light dilatons that ameliorate the cosmological constant problem by studying conformal phase transitions using holography. Finally, we have also checked the robustness of soft-wall geometry by includinghigher curvature terms in the five dimensional bulk action."
etd_230,Binary Program Integrity Models for Defeating Code-Reuse Attacks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Binary Analysis, Code-Reuse Attacks, Control-Flow Integrity, Program Integrity","During a cyber-attack, an adversary executes offensive maneuvers to target computer systems. Particularly, an attacker often exploits a vulnerability within a program, hijacks control-flow, and executes malicious code. Data Execution Prevention (DEP), a hardware-enforced security feature, prevents an attacker from directly executing the injected malicious code. Therefore, attackers have resorted to code-reuse attacks, wherein carefully chosen fragments of code within existing code sections of a program are sequentially executed to accomplish malicious logic. Code-reuse attacks are ubiquitous and account for majority of the attacks in the wild. On one hand, due to the wide use of closed-source software, binary-level solutions are essential. On the other hand, without access to source-code and debug-information, defending raw binaries is hard.A majority of defenses against code-reuse attacks enforce ""control-flow integrity"", a program property that requires the runtime execution of a program to adhere to a statically determined control-flow graph (CFG) -- a graph that captures the intended flow of control within the program. While defenses against code-reuse attacks have focused on reducing the attack space, due to the lack of high-level semantics in the binary, they lack in precision, which in turn results in smaller yet significant attack space.This dissertation presents program integrity models aimed at narrowing the attack space available to execute code-reuse attacks. First, we take a semantic-recovery approach to restrict the targets of indirect branches in a binary. Then, we further improve the precision by recovering C++-level semantics, and enforce a strict integrity model that improves precision for virtual function calls in the binary.Finally, in order to further reduce the attack space, we take a different perspective on defense against code-reuse attacks, and introduce Stack-Pointer Integrity -- a novel integrity model targeted at ensuring the integrity of stack pointer as opposed to the instruction pointer.Our results show that the semantic-recovery-based approaches can help in significantly reducing the attack space by improving the precision of the underlying CFG. Function-level semantic recovery can eliminate 99.47% of inaccurate targets, whereas recovering virtual callsites and VTables at a C++ level can eliminate 99.99% of inaccurate targets."
etd_622,Binge-Watching Rate as a Predictor of Viewer Transportation Mechanisms,Media Studies,"audience, binge-watching, Netflix, streaming, television, transportation","Binge-watching has yet to be adequately analyzed and researched to determine its effects upon viewers, despite the fact that nine in ten Americans engage in the activity (Crupi, 2015).  While some studies have attempted to discover causes or effects of the activity, most research fails to capture the viewing aspects of binge-watching that make the experience unique. This thesis attempted to more specifically define binge-watching, as well as measure its association with viewer transportation – viewer immersion – into the visual narrative. A survey design facilitated the exploration of any linkages between the amount of a viewer’s binge-watching and his or her immersion in the content. Regression analysis found that increases in both total viewing sessions and hours per session predicted an increase in transportation and the subcomponents therein. However, the interaction of the binge-watching variables predicted a decrease in transportation, implying that too much viewing had adverse effects. Further, viewing on tablets and game consoles predicted higher levels of transportation than viewing on Mac or PC. Results and implications for theory and industry are discussed."
etd_587,Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers and Smart Composites,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"biodegradable, composites, elastomers, shape memory, thermoplastic","There is a need for biodegradable thermoplastic elastomers for a variety of medical applications. This dissertation aims at (i) developing and characterizing biodegradable elastomers and (ii) developing and characterizing biodegradable smart composites, both to be used as biomaterials. First, in Chapter 1, an overview was given of the literature of relevant background information on polymers, biomaterials, and previous biodegradable elastomers and responsive elastomeric systems.The first biodegradable elastomer developed and investigated, as presented in Chapter 2, is a novel thermoplastic polyurethane that has a biodegradable soft segment and a crystalline hard segment (POSS). By varying the composition of the poly(caprolactone)-based soft segment as well as the soft segment to hard segment ratio, the thermal and mechanical properties could be controlled. Increasing the comonomer (glycolide or d,l-lactide) content caused a decrease in the thermal and mechanical properties, while increasing POSS caused an increase in these properties. Overall, the synthesized polyurethanes had low moduli, high strain-to-failure, and high elasticity.In Chapter 3, these polymers were degraded in vitro in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to investigate their properties throughout degradation. It was found that increasing the amount of comonomer (glycolide or d,l-lactide) in the soft segment increased the rate of degradation at 37 °C. The mechanical properties of all materials with comonomer decreased before 12 w, even if > 95% of the initial mass remained.  Interestingly, different trends were seen in the 60 °C degradation study.  All materials tested lost their mechanical properties by 4 w. While materials with d,l-lactide decreased over time, the material without comonomer saw a sharp decrease in mass after almost no mass loss during the first weeks of degradation.The POSS-based polyurethane elastomers were then tested for cytocompatibility using a non-contact cell viability assay in Chapter 4. It was found that all of the materials developed in Chapter 2 had low cell viability. Therefore, it was hypothesized that residual tin catalyst (tin-POMS) from synthesis was causing this cytotoxicity. A study was performed systematically varying the tin catalyst used to synthesize PCL1k:POSS. Polymers were synthesized with 1 – 0.01 wt.% tin-POMs, 0.1 – 0.01 wt. % dibutyltin dilaurate, or processed with repeated dissolutions and precipitations to try to wash away the tin.  It was found that the polyurethane synthesized from lowest concentration of tin-POMS catalyst (0.01 wt. %) had the best cell viability without compromising the mechanical properties.The biodegradable, elastomeric polyurethanes and a thermoplastic semi-crystalline polymer, poly(caprolactone), were combined by dual-electrospinning and compaction to fabricate a smart composite. Chapter 5 presents the processing and characterization of these shape memory elastomeric composites, or SMECs. The composites had high elasticity and extensibility while having shape memory capabilities, or the ability to fix into a temporary shape and return to its original shape upon heating. These materials were tested extensively for thermal, mechanical and shape memory properties for different compositions. Increasing poly(caprolactone) generally increased thermal properties, mechanical properties, and fixing. Next, a single composition was degraded at different fixed strains. It was determined that up to 100% fixed strain had no effect on the SMEC degradation profile.In order to produce lower-cost biomaterials, a second type of polyurethane was developed that utilized different length poly(caprolactone) diols as both the hard and soft segments and is presented in Chapter 6. These materials had a higher modulus than the POSS-based materials but had high elasticity. One composition, because of its high molecular weight and therefore high entanglements, had shape memory properties.Finally, in Chapter 7, conclusions and future directions for this work was presented."
etd_21,Biogeochemical Modeling of the Response of Forest Watersheds in the Northeastern U.S. to Future Climate Change,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"AOGCM Downscaling, Biogeochemical Modeling, Climate Change, Forest Watersheds, Hydrology, Northeastern U.S.","In this dissertation I assessed the potential hydrochemical responses of future climate change conditions on forested watersheds in the northeastern U.S. using climate projections from several atmosphere ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) under different carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions scenarios. The impacts of changing climate on terrestrial ecosystems have been assessed by observational, gradient, laboratory and field studies; however, state-of-the-art biogeochemical models provide an excellent tool to investigate climatic perturbations to these complex ecosystems. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to apply a fully integrated coupled hydrological and biogeochemical model (PnET-BGC) to evaluate the effects of climate change and increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 at seven diverse, intensively studied, high-elevation watersheds and to evaluate aspects of these applications. I downscaled coarse scale results to local watersheds and applied these values as input to a biogeochemical model, PnET-BGC.I conducted my research in this dissertation in three phases. In phase one, I used PnET-BGC to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of global change drivers (i.e., temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, CO2) on biogeochemical processes in a northern hardwood forest ecosystem at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) New Hampshire, USA. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to better understand how the model responds to variation in climatic drivers, showing that model results are sensitive to temperature, precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation inputs. Model calculations suggested that future changes in climate that induce water stress (decreases in summer soil moisture due to shifts in hydrology and increases in evapotranspiration), uncouple plant-soil linkages allowing for increases in net mineralization/nitrification, elevated leaching losses of NO3- and soil and water acidification. Anticipated forest fertilization associated with increases in CO2 appears to mitigate this perturbation somewhat.In phase two, I compared the use of two different statistical downscaling approaches- Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) (Grid-based) and Asynchronous Regional Regression Model (ARRM) (station-based) - on potential hydrochemical projections of future climate at the HBEF. The choice of downscaling approach has important implications for streamflow simulations, which is directly related to the ability of the downscaling approach to mimic observed precipitation patterns. The climate and streamflow change signals indicate that the current flow regime with snowmelt-driven spring-flows in April will likely shift to conditions dominated by larger flows throughout winter. Model results from BCSD downscaling show that warmer future temperatures cause midsummer drought stress which uncouples plant-soil linkages, leading to an increase in net soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, and acidification of soil and streamwater. In contrast, the precipitation inputs depicted by ARRM downscaling overcame the risk of drought stress due to greater estimates of precipitation inputs.In phase three of this research, I conducted a cross-site analysis of seven intensive study sites in the northeastern U.S. with diverse characteristics of climate, soil and vegetation type, and historical land disturbances to assess the range of forest-watershed responses to changing climate. Model results show that evapotranspiration increases across all sites under potential future conditions of warmer temperature and longer growing season. Modeling results indicate that spruce-fir forests will likely experience temperature stress and decline in productivity, while some of the northern hardwood forests are likely to experience water stress due to early loss of snowpack, longer growing season and associated water deficit. This latter response is somewhat counter-intuitive as most sites are expected to have increases in precipitation. Following increases in temperature, ET and water stress associated with future climate change scenarios, a shifting pattern in carbon allocation in plants was evident causing significant changes in NPP. The soil humus C pool decreased significantly across all sites and showed strong negative relationship with increases in temperature. Cross-site analysis among different watersheds in the Northeast indicated that dominant type of vegetation, and historical land disturbances coupled with climate variability will influence future responses of watersheds to climate change. The variability in hydrochemical response across sites is due to vegetation type, soil and geological characteristics, and historical land disturbances."
etd_461,"Blazing trails, being us: A narrative inquiry with five high school students with autism who type to communicate",Teaching and Leadership,"Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), Autism, Communication, Disability Studies in Education, Inclusion, Narrative Inquiry","This dissertation chronicles the experiences of five high school students with autism who type to communicate as they navigate the terrain of high school, adolescence, and identity through collaboration and dialogue with one another, their school support team, and the inquirer (researcher). This study employs a multilayered approach to narrative inquiry to unravel and (re)present the students’ (co-inquirers) individual and collective stories as constructed through observation, performance, dialogue, and art. While acknowledging the importance of families and school personnel, the students’ storied lives and perspectives—as well their participation in constructing the inquiry process—are foregrounded to supplement research dominated by adult, and/or spoken voices. Grounded in a disability studies in education framework, this work traverses the institutional, performative, and dialogic landscapes that the students help to shape (and are shaped by) to reveal the complex interplay between diverse ways of being and communicating, dominant discourses of normativity, and resistance through advocacy, inclusion, and research. The reader is invited to follow along as the students cultivate community through (inter)action grounded in shared experience, inclusive educational contexts, and emerging ownership of their situated identities as individuals with autism who communicate in diverse ways. They/we feel compelled—by default and/or design—to put these perspectives and stories into the world as counter-narrative(s). In both content and form, the (re)presentations emerging within/out of this inquiry start a conversation about the constraints of research and inclusion understood solely as practice, advocating for a broadened conception of both as co-constructed, relational experiences."
etd_342,Branched-Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) and Iron Status Effects on Aging Skeletal Muscle,Exercise Science,"Aging, BCAA, Iron, Sarcopenia, Skeletal muscle","Sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle mass and strength with advancing age, has been attracting the attention of many researchers in recent years which is likely the result of the demographic trend of an aging population. Notably, good health of aging individuals includes an adequate level of muscle mass and muscle function to allow performance of activities of daily living.Our group and others have conjectured that elevated skeletal muscle iron status plays a causal role in the development of sarcopenia. The increase in muscle iron concentration with aging could trigger excess production of free radicals and induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, regulating muscle iron levels over the course of aging could be an important strategy to attenuate the onset and/or progression of sarcopenia.Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration is best known for the ability to increase protein synthesis in aging skeletal muscle through activation of mTOR signaling. Recent studies in heart tissue and cell culture suggest a possible link between mTOR and iron status. However, there are currently no studies to examine the effect of BCAA administration on the regulation of iron status in aging skeletal muscle. Thus, we had an interest to examine how low-iron and/or BCAA containing diets regulate muscle iron status, anabolic signaling, oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as muscle mass of aging animals.In this study, 29 month old male F344×Brown Norway rats were divided into two main groups (Control vs. BCAA diet groups) and further separated into subgroups by iron level in the diets (Regular-iron [RI] vs. Low-iron [LI] containing diet). Thus, animals were divided into the following groups: (1) Control + RI (CR; n=11), (2) Control + LI (CL; n=11), (3) 2×BCAA + RI (BR; n=10), and (4) 2×BCAA + LI (BL; n=12). All diets utilized the AIN-93M diet, either in its basic form (i.e., CR) or as a modified formulation (CL, BR, and BL). Low iron diets contained 2-6 ppm iron, compared to regular iron-containing diets (35 ppm iron). 2×BCAA diets contained twice the amount of BCAA compared to the CR and CL diets (BCAA ratio; leucine: isoleucine: valine = 1.5: 1: 1.1). Animals were on the respective diets for 12 weeks. Following the experimental period, animals were euthanized and we determined whether long-term dietary treatments with LI and/or 2×BCAA altered the aging plantaris: (1) muscle mass and muscle fiber size; (2) iron status (non-heme iron concentration and total non-heme iron content); (3) anabolic signaling (mTOR and p70S6K1); (4) mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1(alpha)) and oxidative capacity (CS and COX-2); and (5) oxidative stress (3-nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE).Results showed no difference in body mass and muscle mass between groups after 12 weeks of the dietary treatments. However, histological analysis revealed that animal groups fed LI and/or 2×BCAA diets showed significantly larger plantaris muscle fiber size than that of the CR group. Although the effect of 2×BCAA on plantaris non-heme iron concentration did not reach statistical significance (p=0.150), animals consuming  2×BCAA containing diets showed lower total non-heme iron content compared to CR and CL groups (p<0.05). Moreover, a significant interaction between LI and 2×BCAA for p70S6K1 was identified in the aging skeletal muscle (p<0.05). Here, animals on low iron and/or 2×BCAA treatments had significantly greater p70S6K1 phosphorylation level compared to the CR group (p<0.05). Interestingly, significant interactions were also observed between LI and 2×BCAA for protein levels representative of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1(alpha)) and oxidative capacity (CS and COX-2) (p<0.05). Both PGC-1(alpha) (p<0.05) and COX-2 (p=0.051) were slightly lower in the BL group than in the CL group. Moreover, although CS appeared to be slightly greater in the CL and BR groups than in the CR group (p>0.05), its level in the BL group was similar to the CR group. Hence, combining 2×BCAA with LI appeared to negate a possible positive influence of LI on mitochondrial capacity-related protein expression levels in aging muscle. There was no difference in oxidative stress (3-nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE protein levels) between groups (p>0.05), indicating that these long-term dietary treatments with LI and/or 2×BCAA did not link with oxidative stress in the plantaris muscle of old rats.In conclusion, although there was no effect on muscle mass, the long-term dietary treatments with LI and/or 2×BCAA showed beneficial effects on muscle fiber size. This study found that while only 2×BCAA administration may play a role in the regulation of iron status, anabolic signaling (p70S6K1) was significantly activated by LI and 2×BCAA diets in aging skeletal muscle. However, neither LI nor 2×BCAA containing diets exhibited significant (simple) effects on increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and function of aging skeletal muscle. Interestingly, we found that co-administration of LI and BCAA was likely to negate the potential impact on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in the aging skeletal muscle as compared to either diet administered individually; suggesting possible interfering effects of the combined dietary interventions. Finally, long-term dietary treatment with LI and/or 2×BCAA appeared to have no effect on lowering markers of muscle oxidative stress. Collectively, future studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of LI and BCAA administration on muscle and mitochondrial function in aging skeletal muscle."
mar_etd_2,Brand-Extension or Self-Extension? Using Avatars to Study the Effects of Self-Image Congruence on Brand-Extension Evaluation,Marketing,"Social sciences, Self-image congruence, Brand extension, Avatars","This dissertation investigates the effect of self-image on brand-extension evaluation in the context where self-images are influenced by an avatar. Prior studies have demonstrated the positive effects of self-image congruence on brand evaluation. The brand-extension literature has found that the congruency between the parent-brand and the extension influences the brand-extension evaluation, with moderately incongruent extensions having a stronger effect than either highly incongruent or highly congruent extensions. Missing in the past research is the role of congruency in the self-image/brand relationship, within a brand-extension evaluation context. The brand-extension evaluation literature seems to suggest that, while evaluating a brand-extension, the consumer's focus abandons the parent-brand/consumer relationship and shifts completely towards the parent-brand/brand-extension relationship. Thus, this dissertation had two objectives. The first objective was to confirm that consumers integrate self-image congruence into their brand-extension evaluation process and that this integration will affect their assessment of the brand-extension. The second objective was to show that a consumer's perception of self-image congruence (between the consumer and a particular brand) can be altered via avatar while encountering brand-extensions online.The findings suggested that: [1] avatars indeed influence a consumer's perception of self-image congruence when encountering brands in a digital environment; furthermore, there is a stronger effect when the products of the brand are typically consumed in a public manner, compared to products that are privately consumed; and [2] self-image congruence affects a consumer's evaluation of a brand-extension, such that, highly congruent and moderately incongruent extensions are evaluated evenly, counter-arguing the traditional effects of the moderately-incongruent hypothesis. The steady increase in the number of companies implementing user-controlled avatars in various media outlets (e.g. - company websites, videos games, advergames, and virtual worlds) validates the managerial relevance of these findings."

Cultivated in this new television landscape is the phenomenon of binge watching, a popular conversation piece in the current zeitgeist yet a greatly under-researched topic academically. This exploratory research study was able to make significant strides in understanding binge watching by examining its effect on the viewer - more specifically, how it affects their reception towards a television show. Utilizing a uses and gratifications perspective, this study conducted an experiment on 212 university students who were assigned to watch one of two drama series, and designated a viewing condition, binge watching or appointment viewing. Data gathered using preliminary and post questionnaires, as well as short episodic diary surveys, measured reception factors such as opinion, enjoyment and satisfaction. This study found that the effect of binge watching on viewer reception is contingent on the show. Results also revealed that binge watching better delivers an escape gratification for viewers than appointment viewing."

Working on sovereign Native land also provided valuable on the ground experience in Onondaga language and Haudenosaunee culture - food, humor, lacrosse, art, ceremony, government, education etc.  Throughout my tenure at Onondaga I have used comparison as the backdrop for my experiences collaborating with Native peoples as well as the methodological backbone for this dissertation project.My dissertation project, Brothers in Blood: the Significance of Land and Loss in the Creation of Jewish and Native American Ethnic and Religious Identity, represents an educational union between Syracuse University and the Onondaga Nation School as much as it explores the historical, theological and political interfaces between American Jews and American Indians.  I argue that while the historical maintenance of a social-religious identity, outside a theological context, has caused patterns of Jewish and Native American identity creation to overlap and intersect the incongruities in the lived experiences of Jews in the United States and Natives in the United States arise from competing Jewish, Christian, and Native American orientations to religion, land, and community. Through the prisms of blood, genocide and theology my dissertation examines the interfaces between American Jews and American Indians as they converge and coalesce around patterns of religion, racism and anti-Semitism.  Furthermore, I illustrate how these intersections can serve as a nexus for looking at the formation of race and ethnicity in the United States."
etd_609,Building Affective Trust among  Client-Organization Relationships on Social Media Accounts,Public Relations,"affective trust, relationships, social media","The purpose of this thesis is to determine how consumers relay trust to their favorite brands on social media sites, define affective trust, and how consumers interact with their favorite brands on social media. In-depth interviews were conducted with 22 individuals living across the United States who were in different career fields and stages of life. The findings from this study revealed that not too many of the participants followed Starbucks on mainstream social media sites, but followed them on their propriety application. This application was talked about in multiple interviews where participants talked about the features of the application and how they trust that the content that Starbucks provides will be trustworthy and honored in each one of its cafes. The participants also recognized what trust is but each provided a different definition, which could be combined to allow for the creation of a universal understanding. Each participant was also asked to describe good and bad experiences that they have had with Starbucks or other brands to help them reflect on what can be done better and how trust was developed or broken. Based off of these findings, the researcher further discussed how trust and relationships are important to consumers and brands while making recommendations for the creation of a universal definition for affective trust and recommendations on how to manage a brand’s image and credibility among consumers based off of their interactions in stores or online."

CFD simulations are employed to predict the wind pressure distribution around the building envelope. First, a 2-D CFD study is conducted to explore various techniques of manipulating the building envelope wind pressure distribution. This study indicates that the use of externally mounted flow-resistance devices is an effective method of manipulating the wind pressure distribution. It is demonstrated that this technique is well suited for application to buildings of streamlined cross-section (e.g. elliptical planform). Next, a 3-D CFD study is conducted in order to investigate the performance of the flow resistance device concept applied to a full-scale building. The results indicate that it is possible to significantly alter the pressure distributions at different heights of the building by utilizing continuous resistance devices. Manipulating the wind pressure distribution is shown to confer the ability to control the direction of the airflow exchange (i.e., intake v/s exhaust) in the interior zones of a building. The issue of partially polluted airflow exchange between occupied zones of a building is addressed, and a metric called ASHRAE-Equivalent Airflow is developed to assess the quality of ventilation provided under such conditions. A simple problem is formulated in order to demonstrate the application of this technique for the optimal control of natural ventilation. The results indicate that the resistance device concept may be well suited to meet the ventilation requirements in the building interior, especially when the demand for ventilation is non-uniformly distributed. This technique may be further augmented by allowing for control over the size of ventilation openings. Finally, a brief analysis of various energy consideration related to the application of natural ventilation is performed. It is seen that the energy consumption in a naturally ventilated building may be minimized by appropriately controlling the amount of airflow exchange depending on the external conditions. In addition, the use of wind turbines mounted on the building periphery could be beneficial as the flow resistance medium device may offset a significant fraction of the electrical energy consumption in the building."
etd_703,"Building the Airplane While it Flies: A Case Study Approach of Police Development in Kosovo, Liberia, and Timor-Leste",Public Administration,"conflict, institutions, police, UN","This dissertation examines the development of police forces during post-conflict reconstruction to determine what makes some police development interventions more successful than others.  It addresses three questions: First, does goal incongruence between donors and host states have a negative impact on the outcome of police development? Second, does the structure of organizations, political power, and international agreements predetermine the outcome of police development? Third, does the agency of individuals have an effect on the outcome of police development?  The dissertation aims to fill a gap in our understanding of how the international community develops policing institutions by examining the interaction of goals, structure, and agency.While developing the police is important for the larger concerns of bringing stability in the aftermath of a conflict, the endeavor is futile if the police force is the only sector that develops. Development in areas such as governance, spoiler control, and the economy must coincide with police development, and cannot be assumed to be an inevitable product of establishing security.  Also, flaws in certain structures, whether it be constitutional arrangement, international presence, or other unique factors, can have a larger impact on the development of the police than any tactical decisions that anyone can make.  Finally, while structure forces agents in a direction, individuals can definitely harm the development of the police more than they can help it.  Stated more simply, the power of individual actions to create positive change is less than the power of individual actions to create negative change."
etd_522,Business Calculus Students’ Reasoning about Optimization Problems: A Study of Quantitative Reasoning in an Economic Context,Teaching and Leadership,"Algebraic Reasoning, Business Calculus, Marginal Change, Opportunity to Learn, Optimization Problems, Quantitative Reasoning","While the opportunity to learn mathematics via textbooks is well documented at the secondary and elementary levels, research on the opportunity to learn mathematics via textbooks at the undergraduate level has received little attention. Furthermore, research that examines the role of mathematics textbooks in students’ learning of important concepts such as marginal change in applied calculus is scarce. Research on students’ quantitative reasoning at the post-secondary level is lacking. This qualitative study investigated the opportunity to learn about optimization problems, marginal change, and quantitative reasoning in an economic context via a business calculus textbook and from lectures in a business calculus course. The study also investigated students’ quantitative reasoning, using task based interviews conducted with 12 pairs of business calculus students, about optimization problems and marginal change in an economic context.This study found that the textbook’s presentation of optimization problems and marginal change was largely procedural with limited attention to the underlying concepts and that opportunities for students to reason about relationships between or among economic quantities such as the relationship between marginal cost and marginal revenue at a profit maximizing quantity received little attention. The presentation of optimization problems and marginal change in course lectures closely followed the presentation of these topics in the textbook. Students’ interpretations of marginal change varied in different contexts and representations depending on the tasks they were given. This study provided insights into students’ quantitative reasoning when analyzing multivariable situations in an economic context: students created new quantities that helped them to solve the problems in the tasks and helped them to reason about relationships among several quantities. Implications for different stakeholders including business calculus instructors and suggestions for further research are included."
eee_etd_3,Business Exits and Reentry: Demand and Supply Explanations of Entrepreneur Career Choices,Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises,"Entrepreneurial Exit, Gender Gap, Regulatory Environment, Regulatory Focus Theory, Serial Entrepreneurship, Stigma Theory","This dissertation is a compilation thesis consisting of three research studies on the normative and personal expectations that influence entrepreneurial engagement subsequent to business exits. Collectively, the three studies provide insights into how and when variances between performance expectations and actual business outcomes shift the demand and supply of different groups of experienced entrepreneurs. On the demand side, I theorize and empirically examine variances in acts and modes of entrepreneurial engagement that correlate to informal (stigma of business failure, masculine norms) and formal (regulatory environment) institutional contexts. On the supply side, I develop propositions about cognitive aspects of business exits that influence the motivation of experienced entrepreneurs to engage in serial entrepreneurship. I ask the following three questions in my dissertation research: When and how do the fit or non-fit of exits from successful and unsuccessful businesses influence future engagement in entrepreneurship activity (Study 1)? How are the future career decisions of entrepreneurs who close failed businesses influenced by formal, i.e., the regulatory environment for doing business, and informal, i.e., the stigma of business failure, institutional contexts (Study 2)? Do differences in normative expectations influence the re-entry of male and female entrepreneurs differently following the closure of a failed business (Study 3)? The extant studies in the entrepreneurship literature often emphasize the characteristics of the entrepreneur or the institutional context. This dissertation highlights the fact that social realities, in concert with the cognitive processing of business exits, shape the acts and modes of entrepreneurial engagement subsequent to business exits. The implications for entrepreneurship theory, policy and practice that arise from this duality are discussed."
etd_694,BUSINESS FAILURE AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THREE ESSAYS ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COST OF FAILURE,Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises,"Business Failure, Entrepreneurship, Real Options Theory, Review, Social cost of failure, Stigma of failure","When entrepreneurs encounter business failure, they have to bear the financial, emotional, and social cost of failure. Prior research on the effects of these costs has focused mainly on entrepreneurial exit context or on the quantity of new firms. Moreover, these studies suggest to policy makers to establish institutions to lower the costs of failure with the aim of increasing entrepreneurial activities. However, this dissertation seeks to improve our understanding by providing more extensive and fine-grained assessments of the effects of the cost of business failure in entrepreneurship contexts. The first essay in this dissertation conducts a systematic review regarding the role of institutions that are related to the cost of business failure in entrepreneurial decisions and behaviors. The review extensively takes stock of what has been studied on the effect of the costs of failure and provides future research questions to advance our knowledge. The second and third essay respond to the call of research questions from the review study of this dissertation while utilizing real options logic and multi-level analysis. In particular, the second essay shows that while high social costs of failure can negatively impact the quantity of entrepreneurs in society, there can also be a positive impact on the quality of the entrepreneurs who enter and persist in their careers. In particular, this study finds evidence of a positive relationship between high social costs of business failure and the entry of entrepreneurs with growth and export orientation. The third essay finds that the stigma of failure is positively associated with social entrepreneurship entry decisions. Further, the stigma of failure affects revenue-generating type social entrepreneurship, but not NGO-type social entrepreneurship."
etd_399,Butlers of the Mohawk Valley: Family Traditions and the Establishment of British Empire in Colonial New York,History,"American Colonies, American Revolution, Colonial New York, French and Indian War, Iroquois, Rangers","Historians follow those tributaries of early American history and trace their converging currents as best they may in an immeasurable river of human experience.  The Butlers were part of those British imperial currents that washed over mid Atlantic America for the better part of the eighteenth century. In particular their experience reinforces those studies that recognize the impact that the Anglo-Irish experience had on the British Imperial ethos in America. Understanding this ethos is as crucial to understanding early America as is the Calvinist ethos of the Massachusetts Puritan or the Republican ethos of English Wiggery.	We don't merely suppose the Butlers are part of this tradition because their story begins with Walter Butler, a British soldier of the Imperial Wars in America. We don't assume it because his son, John Butler and grandson, Walter Butler were Tories and Loyalists during the American Revolution. An imperial identity was one that they claimed for themselves in a country where other, alternative identities were possible. For the Butlers, the British imperial ethos informed the nature of their careers, their wealth, and the manner in which they were socially connected to other Americans. It is manifest in their claim of ancestral connection to the Butler-Ormonde family, a fountain of Anglo-Irish leaders for centuries. It is manifest in Walter Butler’s career on the garrisons of the New York frontier, at Fort Hunter and Oswego. It is manifest in the type of wealth the Butlers amassed and the traditions passed down to Walter Butler’s sons. Lastly it is manifest in the part the John Butler played in the transformation of a frontier garrison to an English county within the British Empire. They are not merely representative of the way an imperial ethos impacted early America, they are important as well for the lasting impression that they in particular made on the English frontier of New York.A close look at the Butler family reveals a reality of the frontier largely ignored in previous works. That the imperial frontier embodied colonial ideals not often realized to its full extent. That the advantages that came from being part of the imperial frontier could be significant, but were often contingent on circumstances beyond the reach of those that commanded frontier posts. That competing colonial interests festered for years before the American Revolution. Finally, That the British Indian Department, long thought of as not only the personal creation of folk legend Sir William Johnson but a bulwark of imperial strength on the New York frontier, was much weaker than earlier supposed, in terms of the ability to direct Indian peoples and control frontier settlement by European peoples. The Butlers amassed great wealth and power over three generations on the New York frontier, lost much to imperial and civil war, and helped forge the new British nation of Canada in the wake of the American Revolution.  The Butlers were not aberrations, bogeymen bent on evil or herculean forest warriors. They were British frontier soldiers, carving out pieces of Anglo empire from a turbulent frontier land, and struggling to navigate the myriad of obstacles and opportunities that would spell success or doom for the British Empire and the Butlers themselves."

Investigating the Effects of a Wireless Grid Social Radio Station on Collaboration and Communication in Fragile Populations,Information Management and Technology,"activity theory, disabilities, education, information and communication technologies, social cognitive theory, wireless grids","The ability to interact with peers and coworkers in online digital networks is essential in learning and business environments. Our digital participatory culture is based on communication in response to purposeful activity and is facilitated by information and communication technologies (ICT). Students with emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities are often disengaged and excluded from this knowledge-building conversation. This disengagement results in a cycle of failure exhibited through diminished self-efficacy and inadequate academic and emotional self-regulation. A critical goal of those who work with these students is to bolster their resilience, persistence, participatory, and communicative skills--to invite them back into the conversation.This research study investigated the potential for wireless grids technologies to serve as a viable infrastructure for students in a therapeutic high school setting to participate in digital social networks. Using social cognitive theory as a theoretical framework and activity theory as a conceptual framework, this study specifically investigated how a wireless grids implementation of the WeJay Social Radio Edgeware Gridlet was used to positively impact perceived self-efficacy and academic and emotional self-regulation associated with written and oral communication. This study also investigated how a digital networked environment could extend and enhance current methods used by school staff and programs to address cognitive, emotional, and behavioral issues affecting student socialization and learning in a therapeutic high school setting.The supports, resources, and opportunities for collaboration and socialization in the networked environment of the research space proved motivating for students and staff, and fostered academic, emotional, and behavioral self-regulation and positive self-efficacy for written and oral communications as evidenced by the artifacts and radio shows produced by students. Furthermore, students and staff participants expressed their interest in continuing to use WeJay. The outcomes of this research study suggest that informal, interest-based learning should take place in school. For some students, school is the only place they will have access to the technology and supports required to engage in powerful informal learning experiences. For fragile populations, these experiences may provide opportunities for success that have eluded students in formal, teacher-directed, curriculum-driven educational settings."
etd_252,Capacity Analysis for Gaussian and Discrete Memoryless Interference Networks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"Interference is an important issue for wireless communication systems where multipleuncoordinated users try to access to a common medium. The problem is even morecrucial for next-generation cellular networks where frequency reuse becomes ever moreintense, leading to more closely placed co-channel cells. This thesis describes our attempt to understand the impact of interference on communication performance as well as optimal ways to handle interference. From the theoretical point of view, we examine how interference affects the fundamental performance limits, and provide insights on how interference should be treated for various channel models under different operatingconditions. From the practical design point of view, we provide solutions to improve thesystem performance under unknown interference using multiple independent receptionsof the same information.For the simple two-user Gaussian interference channel, we establish that the simpleFrequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) technique suffices to provide the optimal sum-rate within the largest computable subregion of the general achievable rate region for acertain interference range.For the two-user discrete memoryless interference channels, we characterize differentinterference regimes as well as the corresponding capacity results. They include one-sided weak interference and mixed interference conditions. The sum-rate capacities arederived in both cases. The conditions, capacity expressions, as well as the capacity achieving schemes are analogous to those of the Gaussian channel model. The studyalso leads to new outer bounds that can be used to resolve the capacities of several newdiscrete memoryless interference channels.A three-user interference up-link transmission model is introduced. By examining howinterference affects the behavior of the performance limits, we capture the differencesand similarities between the traditional two-user channel model and the channel modelwith more than two users. If the interference is very strong, the capacity region is justa simple extension of the two-user case. For the strong interference case, a line segmenton the boundary of the capacity region is attained. When there are links with weakinterference, the performance limits behave very differently from that of the two-usercase: there is no single case that is found of which treating interference as noise isoptimal. In particular, for a subclass of Gaussian channels with mixed interference, aboundary point of the capacity region is determined. For the Gaussian channel withweak interference, sum capacities are obtained under various channel coefficients andpower constraint conditions. The optimalities in all the cases are obtained by decodingpart of the interference.Finally, we investigate a topic that has practical ramifications in real communicationsystems. We consider in particular a diversity reception system where independentlycopies of low density parity check (LDPC) coded signals are received. Relying only onnon-coherent reception in a highly dynamic environment with unknown interference, soft-decision combining is achieved whose performance is shown to improve significantly over existing approaches that rely on hard decision combining."
etd_324,Capturing the Impairment Profile of College Students with Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Symptoms,Psychology,"ADHD, College Students, Impairment, Sluggish Cognitive Tempo","Over the past 15 years, researchers have shown increasing interest in Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) symptoms.  Though SCT symptoms were once considered symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) inattentive type, controversy now exists regarding the role of the SCT symptom set in mental health. Several questions remain regarding whether SCT symptoms are separate from related symptom sets (i.e., ADHD, anxiety, depression) and whether SCT symptoms have any negative impact on a person's day-to-day functioning.  This exploratory study examined a large, general sample of college students to determine (a) whether SCT symptoms form a separate factor from ADHD, anxiety, and depression in a college sample and (b) what negative outcomes, if any, were associated with SCT symptoms. Factor analyses indicated that SCT symptoms formed a statistically separate factor from symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Students with high levels of SCT symptoms report significantly more impairment compared to students with low levels of SCT symptoms. However, regression analyses suggest that SCT symptoms do not account for significant amounts of unique impairment after controlling for related symptoms (i.e., ADHD, anxiety, depression) and variables (i.e., sleep, health, substance use). The lack of impairment associated with SCT symptoms suggests that it may serve as an underlying construct of many mental health and lifestyle variables, rather than standing independently as a mental health construct."

The topics covered in this dissertation fall into three broad categories : (a) intracellular mechanics, (b) interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix and (c) collective mechanics of multicellular colonies. In part (a) I propose theoretical models for motor-filament interactions in the cell cytoskeleton, which is the site for mechanical force generation in cells. The models predict in a unified manner how contractility, dynamic instabilities and mechanical waves arise in the cytoskeleton by tuning the activity of molecular motors. The results presented in (a) holds relevance to a variety of cellular systems that behave elastically at long time scales, such as muscle sarcomeres, actomyosin stress fibers, adherent cells. In part (b) I introduce a continuum mechanical model for cells adherent to two-dimensional extracellular matrix, and discuss how cells can sense mechanical and geometrical cues from its surrounding matrix. The model provides an important step towards a unified theoretical description of the dependence of traction forces on cell size, actomyosin activity, matrix depth and stiffness, strength of focal adhesions and makes experimentally testable predictions. In part (c) we combine experiment and theory to reveal how intercellular adhesions modulate forces transmitted to the extracellular matrix. We find that In the absence of cadherin-based adhesions, cells within a colony appear to act independently, whereas with strong cadherin-based adhesions, the cell colony behaves like a liquid droplet wetting the substrate underneath. This work defines the importance of intercellular adhesions in coordinating mechanical activity of cell monolayers and has implications for the mechanical regulation of tissues during development, homeostasis, and disease."

It was hypothesized that a lower incidence of challenging behaviors in preschool children with and without developmental disabilities would be associated with high use of parent management behaviors. The Early Child Behavior Screen as well as the Parenting Young Children (PARYC): Self-Report Parenting Measure were used to capture children’s challenging behaviors and parents’ management behaviors, respectively. The current study surveyed 56 total parents. Out of the parents that responded, 46 were female, 48 identified themselves as white, and the average age was 36.8 years old. The children in the study were 31 males and 25 females with a mean age of 4 years and 3 months, and 19 children were identified as children with special needs. The results indicated that children with developmental disabilities have lower levels of prosocial behaviors than children without developmental disabilities. There was no difference between parents of children with special needs and parents of children developing typically in terms of parent management behaviors. The parent management behaviors of limit setting, proactive parenting, and positive parenting were associated with challenging behaviors in children without a developmental disability or delay, but these parent behaviors were not associated with challenging behaviors in children with special needs. The implications of the study are that parent management behaviors are not associated with challenging behaviors in children with special needs, but these same parent management behaviors are effective in children without developmental disabilities or delays. Because children with developmental disabilities or delays had lower levels of prosocial behaviors in this study, alternative parenting behaviors need to be researched in order to make recommendations for this population."

Such an integrated framework would not only enable design optimization, but also enable confirmation of design intent or diagnosis of performance deficiency, and thus provide feedbacks for future building design. This dissertation study represents the first step toward this ultimate goal, and had the following specific objectives:: 1) developing a combined heat, air, moisture and pollutant transport model for whole building performance simulation; 2) developing a real-time building IEQ and energy performance monitoring system using a Virtual Building structure to facilitate fast comparison between design and montored performance.; 3) developing a methodology to use CHAMPS-Multizone for a green building design throughout its initial and final design stage. The CHAMPS-Multizone model consists of building envelope model, room model, HVAC model and airflow model, and has an efficient and accurate numeric solvers. The model is tested under different building cases including ASHRAE 140 standard test and a three zones building test and comparision with EnergyPlus calculation results. The Virtual Building is a digital representation of the physical building with a hierarchical data structure, containing both static data such as enclosure assemblies, internal layout, etc. and dynamic data such as occupant activity schedule, outdoor weather conditions, indoor environmental parameters, HVAC operation data and energy consumption data. Then, the Virtual Building approach has been demonstrated in a LEED office building with its monitoring system. Finally, a multi-stage design process was formulated that considers the impact of climate and site, form and massing, external enclosure, internal configuration and environmental system on the whole building performance as simulated by CHAMPS-Multizone. Using the testbed building, both simulation results were also compared with the results monitored by the Virtual Building monitoring system. Future research includes refining CHAMPS-Multizone simulation capability and adding modules such as water loop calculation and integrating HVAC calculation with EnergyPlus."
etd_327,Change Point Detection and Estimation in Sequences of Dependent Random Variables,Mathematics,"Bootstrap, Change Point, CUSUM, Dependent Random Variables, Likelihood Ratio","Two change point detection and estimation procedures for sequences of dependent binary random variables are proposed and their asymptotic properties are explored. The two procedures are a dependent cumulative sum statistic (DCUSUM) and a dependent likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, which are generalizations of the independent CUSUM and LRT statistics.A one step Markov dependence is assumed between consecutive variables in the sequence, and the performance of the DCUSUM and dependent LRT are shown to have substantially better size and power performance than their independent counterparts. In most cases, a comparison of the dependent procedures via simulation shows that the dependent LRT provides a more powerful test, while the DCUSUM test has better size performance.The asymptotic distribution of the DCUSUM test is found to be a weighted sum ofsquared Brownian bridge processes and an approximation to calculate p-values is discussed. A Worsley type upper bound for p-values is provided as an alternative. The asymptotic distribution of the dependent LRT is unknown, but the tail probabilities are found to be empirically bounded by chi-square random variables with 6 and 7 degrees of freedom through a simulation study. A bootstrap algorithm to estimate p-values for the dependent LRT is discussed.Extensions of these procedures to multiple sequences and multinomial random variables are discussed, and a new statistic, the maximal change count statistic, is proposed. An application of the multiple sequence procedures to clustered time series models is provided. The asymptotic properties of the generalized procedures are reserved for future research."
etd_29,Character Education In and Out of the Classroom: Black Women Middle School Educators Share their Views on Media Images of Black,Mass Communications,"Stereotypes, Black women, Media images","A series of stereotypes and distortions in mass media about black women have limited understandings of their womanhood in America. The configurations of black women's stories in these media images also have certain linkages to black women's social experiences. The viewpoints of black women on this phenomenon, in which ideas about their identities are shaped by intersecting social and media forces, have often been left out of academic research. In addition, black women usually are not the primary storytellers in studies about their experiences with mass media. A black feminist standpoint theory lens is utilized in this exploratory phenomenological study to substantiate the importance of including black women's voices in academic research. Through in-depth interviews, fifteen (N=15) black women middle school educators in the northeastern United States share how they make sense of media images depicting black women and situate these perceptions within the contexts of their own experiences, biographies, and positionings in social spaces. The women also provide illustrative stories of the roles they think media images of black women play in their interactions and teaching practices with black adolescent girls in middle schools.The findings reveal that the educators' social experiences, definitions of their narratives, and viewpoints on the importance of their work with black adolescent girls are connected to mass media images of black women on multiple levels. New insight into the function and significance of media images in the lives of black women is gained."
etd_385,Characterization and Chemical Kinetic Analysis of the Ignition of Representative Conventional and Bio-Derived Fuels,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Biofuel Ignition, Chemical kinetic modeling, Fuel blends, Furans, Model reduction, Shock tube","Fossil fuels are the main energy source in the world. However, they are responsible for negative environmental impacts, such as global climate change and rising sea levels. Biofuels are an environmentally friendly alternative which can substitute fossil fuels without major engine modications, especially in the transportation sector. Furans, a class of biofuels, are considered as possible alternative fuels for SI engines. They can be produced from sugars, derived from non-food biomass sources. This thesis is a contribution to fundamental characterization of their combustion properties.Reactivity trends in furan combustion are established through ignition delay measurements of selected furans; 2,5-dimethyl furan (DMF), 2-methyl furan (2-MF), and furan. The isomer effect on the ignition of alkylated furans is also investigated to understand the general trends between dimethyl and ethyl isomers of cyclic fuel components. Since near term use of biofuels involves blends with fossil fuels, the relative ignition behavior of the least reactive furan, DMF, the gasoline surrogate, iso-octane, and their blends, is investigated. Experiments are carried out in a shock tube, a reactor that can generate instantaneous high temperature and pressure conditions by means of reflected shock wave, leading to chemical reactions and subsequent ignition of a test mixture of fuel and oxidizer.Experimental results are compared with chemical kinetic model simulations and the models are analyzed to gain insight on leading chemical pathways. The experimental results for furans and iso-octane are compared to the most recent chemical kinetic models of each fuel and a combined DMF/iso-octane model is developed for the analysis of fuel blend combustion. The new blend model is used to clarify the chemical interactions during ignition of fuel blends.The thesis also considers the ignition of saturated furans. In this respect the ignition behavior of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) is investigated to establish relative reactivity trends. The results are put into context by comparing with the unsaturated furan, 2-MF.Cyclic fuel components of non-biofuel nature are considered. The high-temperature autoignition delay times of dimethyl and ethyl isomers of cyclohexane are carried out behind reflected shock waves to establish reactivity dierences between these dimethyl and ethyl isomers, which could further be explored in chemical kinetic modeling. The study is designed to test whether the observed trend is indicative of general reactivity differences between dimethyl and ethyl isomers of cyclic hydrocarbons, oxygenated or non-oxygenated. The ignition delay times of ECH are compared to model predictions to test the model performance. The pronounced dierences in the high-temperature ignition delay times of these isomers are clearly established using the shock tube technique and motivate further mechanistic explorations of distinguishing reaction pathways, without necessarily invoking the morecomplex low-temperature chemistry.With regards to model reduction, the existing Alternate Species Elimination (ASE) model reduction method is employed for the reduction of recently reported iso-octane and n-heptane models. The ASE approach is expanded into a stochastic species sampling approach, referred to as the Stochastic Species Elimination (SSE) method. The SSE method allows for a linear reduction process, and involves new features leading to reduced computational resource requirements, compared to the standard ASE method. Larger systems, such as the recent literature model of n-octanol, are approached with the SSE method with multiple species sampling, which allows for a less time consuming model reduction process. Resulting skeletal models are shown to adequately predict ignition delay times as well as flame propagation, compared to the predictions of the detailed models.The work advances understanding of biofuel combustion. The established reactivity trends between the various fuels investigated in this work is of great importance to transportation fuel technology. The resulting experimental data sets are expected to fill the gap in the understanding of furans and gasoline combustion. The combined DMF/iso-octane model is a main contribution that allows for better insight into the combustion chemistry of furans, iso-octane, and their blends. Further, the proposed SSE model reduction method contributes to the use of combustion chemistry in practical combustion analysis in the form of cost-effective reduced models."
etd_339,CHARACTERIZATION OF FUNDAMENTAL COMMUNICATION LIMITS OF STATE-DEPENDENT INTERFERENCE NETWORKS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Information theory, Wireless communication","Interference management is one of the key techniques that drive evolution of wireless networks from one generation to another. Techniques in current cellular networks to deal with interference follow the basic principle of orthogonalizing transmissions in time, frequency, code, and space. My PhD work investigate information theoretic models that represent a new perspective/technique for interference management. The idea is to explore the fact that an interferer knows the interference that it causes to other users noncausally and can/should exploit such information for canceling the interference. In this way, users can transmit simultaneously and the throughput of wireless networks can be substantially improved. We refer to the interference treated in such a way as ``dirty interference'' or ""noncausal state"".Towards designing a dirty interference cancelation framework, my PhD thesis investigates two classes of information theoretic models and develops dirty interference cancelation schemes that achieve the fundamental communication limits. One class of models (referred to as state-dependent interference channels) capture the scenarios that users help each other to cancel dirty interference. The other class of models (referred to as state-dependent channels with helper) capture the scenarios that one dominate user interferes a number of other users and assists those users to cancel its dirty interference. For both classes of models, we develop dirty interference cancelation schemes and compared the corresponding achievable rate regions (i.e., inner bounds on the capacity region) with the outer bounds on the capacity region. We characterize the channel parameters under which the developed inner bounds meet the outer bounds either partially of fully, and thus establish the capacity regions or partial boundaries of the capacity regions."
bio_etd_84,Characterization of Genetic Elements of Arabidopsis Thaliana Involved In Defense Responses against Bacterial Pathogen Pseudomonas Syringae,Biology,,"Plants in the field are involved in a constant struggle with various environmental factors to sustain survival. In this research work, I am reporting characterization of three genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, namely DAP1 (atypical aspartyl protease), WDA1 (AAA ATPase) and Aox1d (alternative oxidase), involved in modulating plant defense responses to bacterial pathogens. Our current knowledge about plant aspartic proteases is limited and this work emphasizes the role of these proteins in immune responses. DAP1, DEFENSE- ASSOCIATED ASPARTIC PROTEASE1, encodes an apoplastic protease and has plant growth- and development-associated functions. Plants overexpressing DAP1 display compromised immunity and suggesting that DAP1 negatively regulates plant defense. Deleterious effects of DAP1 overexpression during pathogen infection may be related to its apoplastic localization and biochemical activity. WDA1, WALKER-TYPE DEFENSE ASSOCIATED AAA ATPase, shows a novel expression profile in response to pathogen infection and plays a role in positively regulating plant basal defense responses. Characterization of WDA1 also emphasizes the fact that plants have evolved to recognize different types of pathogens and orchestrate defense responses accordingly in order to maximize energy conservation during defense. Finally, I am presenting the characterization of Aox1d. This gene is induced in response to a myriad of biotic and abiotic stresses. Alternative oxidases are well described for their roles to help plants endure abiotic stresses. They have been shown to be responsive to pathogen infection; however, this is the first report showing a critical role of an alternative oxidase in plant immunity. Here I show that Aox1d positively regulates plant defense, probably by ameliorating damage caused by oxidative stress during such biotic interactions."
etd_206,Characterization of three Arabidopsis genes involved in regulating defense and flowering,Biology,"Abiotic and biotic stress response, Defense response, Flowering time, Gene regulation, miRNA Post-transcriptional gene regulation, Senescence","Due to their sessile nature, plants face multiple threats to their existence that include biotic stresses such as attacks from pathogens, herbivores, insects and abiotic stresses like heat, cold, drought, water logging, lack of nutrients, low/high light, ROS and ionizing radiations. To face these challenges, plants have developed an intricate mechanism of gene regulation that is complex and fine tuned to mount different responses to different signals using the same subsets of genetic resources. Many such genes/proteins that are important to the plant are also important to human beings since plants are a primary source of energy and food, among other necessities. Hence understanding the nature and the mode of regulation of these genes is not only important to our basic understanding but also provides an opportunity to manipulate these genes for the benefit of both plants and humans.Here I have tried to characterize three unknown genes from Arabidopsis - one encoding a senescence marker (SAG13), one encoding a putative nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) gene designated here as DLP1, and one encoding a microRNA named DmiR. My work sheds light for the first time, on a very commonly used marker of senescence and shows that it regulates multiple processes in the plant including disease resistance, senescence, flowering, sugar responses, seed germination and seedling development.I have also characterized another unknown gene DLP1, belonging to a family of genes that encode for many antimicrobial compounds and are components of most of food allergens.   In my work I have shown its role defense and flowering, and provide evidence that it is regulated by a very interesting but yet novel mechanism. Both these genes have similarity to other genes in higher plants, including many crop species. Taken together, my findings suggest novel ways to manipulate plants for better diseases resistance as well as ways to engineer plants for increased biomass for use as use as livestock feed and biofuels."

Even slight variations in thesolid-state packing arrangement of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) can greatlyinfluence the effectiveness of the product. This work investigates various aspects of thepharmaceutical screening process, including: the characterization of polymorphs(external changes in the solid-state packing arrangement of a solid or internalconformational), investigation of disorder (conformational or positional), and theformation of cocrystals. The chosen tool for these investigations is terahertzspectroscopy. Terahertz spectroscopy probes the solid-state lattice specific, lowfrequencyvibrations (sub-100 cm-1) of molecular solids, providing a useful tool for thedifferentiation of polymorphs. In this work, terahertz spectroscopy is used to detect andidentify different polymorphic materials, with up to eight polymorphs that exhibitdisorder (both internal and external), undergo solid-state phase transitions, are affected byhumidity, or exist as cocrystals. The relative stabilities of the crystalline polymorphs arean important aspect of the manufacturing and effective utilization of pharmaceuticals andcan be investigated using solid-state density functional theory in combination withterahertz spectroscopy. The approach of combining these experimental and theoreticalmethods yields insight into the formation and stability of the polymorphs by revealing thebalance between the intermolecular and intramolecular forces that is ultimatelyresponsible for the physical characteristics."
etd_499,Characterizing the Relationship Between Related and Unrelated Items in Recognition Memory,Psychology,"Recognition memory, Semantic similarity, Signal Detection Theory","Previous work has shown that semantic similarity results in a memory bias in which related words are more likely than unrelated words to be labeled as studied in recognition memory. I explored the relationship between semantic similarity memory bias and memory for unrelated words. I varied the strength of the related word memory bias by manipulating the proportion of related to unrelated words, and the type of related word used. I showed that as the bias for related words increases, the unrelated false alarm rate decreases. To further characterize the relationship between related and unrelated words, I examined how the related and unrelated words affect memory decisions when they are experienced separately at test. This manipulation diminished the related word memory bias, but the decrease in unrelated word false alarms remained. These findings suggest a compelling relationship between semantic similarity and unrelated items that warrants further investigation."

However, strong empirical support is lacking along with wide variation of implementation among early childhood programs. Employing a qualitative design, this study investigated child care center directors' perceptions of continuity of care as a quality indicator and best practice in early care and education programs. Twenty-one child care center directors were interviewed using a list of open-ended questions gauging knowledge of and experience with continuity of care. Interviews were transcribed using Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software and loaded into NVivo 8, a qualitative data analysis software package. Three central themes around directors' understanding of and belief in continuity of care, continuity of care relevant to program operation, and career development emerged from the data. Seventy-one percent of child care center directors defined continuity of care as sameness of caregiving routines, daily schedule, and programmatic rules and policies for parents. Eighty-one percent of directors reported continuity of care as advantageous to the caregiver-child relationship, but were uncertain of the establishment of continuity of care as a policy. Child care center directors encountered an array of administrative challenges on a daily basis and were pressured to make decisions based upon the financial stability of the program. Fifty-two percent of directors did not understand how continuity of care could be implemented into a child care center program and 76 percent of directors did not think continuity of care could be implemented at their particular center due to issues with enrollment, staffing and training. Seventy-six percent of child care center directors reported child care as a critical profession.Child care center directors reported difficulty in hiring and retaining quality staff due to limited earnings potential and substandard benefits and believed offering a higher rate of pay would improve upon the professionalism of the field."

Three inventories were used to assess each factor in this research: child violence experience (5 items), interpersonal difficulties (16 items), and adult violence victimization (3 items). Twenty-ninth females from the Syracuse University Couple and Family Therapy Center completed inventories. Respondents were categorized into four groups: no victimization (group 1); child violence (CV) victimization with no adult revictimization (group 2); CV with single adult victimization (group 3); CV with long-term intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization (group 4). The researcher hypothesized that 1) child sexual abuse (CSA) will lead to adult interpersonal difficulties; 2) Re-victimized CSA survivors will have more interpersonal difficulties than those CSA survivors who have not experienced IPV; and 3) CSA victims who stay in IPV relationships will have more interpersonal difficulties. The sample size was small so descriptive and correlational analysis was also conducted. The preliminary results show that CSA can lead to some interpersonal difficulties. The pattern of interpersonal difficulties across four groups were presented, which indicated that people who stayed in abusive intimate relationships might have different profiles from people who experienced single or short-term revictimization. Limitations of this study and suggestions for future researches were included."

Drawing on in-depth interviews with twenty-seven Chinese American women from two universities located on the East Coast, I argue that their segmented assimilation processes involving ongoing negotiations between maintaining ties with their ethnic and cultural backgrounds and selective integration into the mainstream of the society, which, to some extent, are subject to and predetermined by their parents` pre- and post-migration conditions. At the same time, my participants also struggled with how their self-defined ethnic identity intertwined with a socially constructed racial identity.My data show multiple settlement patterns among new Chinese immigrants, including traditional ethnic enclaves, and suburban white areas as well as a diverse class composition of college-educated professionals, small business owners, and working-class laborers. Those professionals from middle-class backgrounds had higher upward mobility and less residential restrictions. Participants who grew up in white neighborhoods and inner-city ethnic enclaves had different ways of understanding what it means to be Chinese American. Their identification is also subject to how they incorporated educational values and resources from their family and formal schooling into their own understandings of the social world they live in, how they negotiated their situatedness between their ethnic culture and the mainstream, and how they were recognized by others while dealing with stereotypes and discrimination. As a consequence, their identities changed over time when they were positioned in different social contexts and locations."

Challenging the academic discourse that reduced the vast range of experiences to linguistic and cultural accumulation (Kasper, 1997; Klomega, 2006; Lewthwaite, 1997; Misra & Castillo, 2004), this study focused specifically on Chinese women’s narratives of negotiating classroom silence, the leftover woman discourse, and the good Chinese woman discourse. For women growing up in China, a country long dominated by patriarchal norms that still define women through motherhood and femininity, attending graduate school in the US not only meant educational achievement, but also offered a chance to advance their careers, and recraft gender roles and boundaries. This study showed that as socially situated complex subjects, Chinese women articulated a wide range of complexities involved in living their lives under different cultural contexts, as well as the multiple ways of living and learning among the complexities. The study has implications for researchers, policy-makers, and educators in the fields of higher education, international education, as well as gender studies."

Forty-eight 5-year-olds and their mothers were recruited from 4 kindergartens from Northeastern China, and participated in two informal mathematical tasks (one geometry puzzle task and one map task). Mother-child teaching interactions were videotaped. The results revealed that Chinese mothers modified their teaching strategies based on the task, and these behavior may reflect their understanding and cultural interpretation of the task. the findings also suggested that there might be a stable structure pattern of maternal teaching across tasks, and the relations between maternal teaching behaviors and children’s activity seems to resemble the white-middle-class pattern, which suggested that open-ended and positive teaching strategies might be more important in promoting children’s independent engagement than directing and focusing teaching strategies."

More specifically, this thesis centers on the city of Chicago to analyze the use of the war metaphor throughout the city's history, from earlier invocations by Mayors to present- day, local appropriations in the form of the metaphor Chiraq, which blends Chicago and Iraq as a statement to the conditions of some of Chicago's most resource deprived neighborhoods. Using Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory I will outline how the war metaphor has been studied in rhetoric and utilized in Presidential, Mayoral, and media discourses in chapter one. In chapter two, I will turn my attention to fragments organized around the metaphorical term Chiraq and apply CMT to highlight how the war metaphor has become a central component of daily language in Chicago's most volatile neighborhoods."

It uses the lived experiences of Indian indentured workers in Mauritius to examine the notions of rights and the development of workers’ claims to citizenship rights. It argues that these claims depended on shifting global historical circumstances, a mesh of colonial governmental networks in India, Mauritius and Britain and the local colonial bureaucratic apparatus. It further contends that workers’ politics in the broadest sense of the term created the idea of the right-bearing citizen even before the emergence of anti-colonial nationalism and the nation-state. I explain how workers’ struggles for rights translated into the eventual making of a multiethnic nation and this differs from earlier historians who have emphasized circular migration and formation of local capital in the colony. The dissertation secondly re-shapes ocean studies in explaining how labor was a critical component of the Indian Oceanic world of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Earlier historians of the Indian Ocean have tended to focus temporally on the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries and thematically on trade and commerce ignoring the role of labor. Finally, the dissertation builds on the premise that indentured workers had agency and expressed it differently through imaginative readings of their contract, petitions and strikes."

phy_etd_128,Classical and Quantum Correlated Percolation,Physics,"classical percolation, isostatic network, k-core, quantum percolation, tricritical point","Percolation is the study of connected structures in disordered networks. As edges are randomly and independently added to the network, clusters of neighboring edges grow in size until there ultimately exists a percolating cluster. The emergence of this percolating cluster exhibits properties of a continuous phase transition. The simplicity of uncorrelated percolation makes it the Ising model of connectivity-driven phase transitions. This thesis documents a quest to go beyond uncorrelated percolation and investigate transitions in correlated percolation models where there are constraints on the addition of edges (or vertices). Such constraints are inspired by glassy and jamming systems, for example. More specifically, we discuss several correlated percolation models, the k-core model on random graphs, and the spiral and counter-balance models in two-dimensions---all exhibiting discontinuous transitions yet with diverging correlation lengths---in an effort to identify the needed ingredients for such a novel transition. We also construct mixtures of these models to interpolate between a continuous transition and a discontinuous transition to search for tricriticality. Then, to capture both the local and global mechanical stability properties of disordered particle packings, we work towards building jamming graphs via the Henneberg construction. This construction is another example of a correlated percolation model since there are constraints on the addition (and removal) of edges. Jamming graphs provide for a more rigorous way to define the jamming transition for repulsive soft spheres as well as a starting point to understanding how the local and global mechanical properties interact and characterize the system. In addition, we study quantum transport properties along these disordered networks with correlations in the connectivity and investigate how such correlations affect, for example, the transition from insulator to metal as the percolating cluster emerges. Treating each occupied edge as a quantum scatterer and invoking the random phase approximation, we find for k=3-core networks on the Bethe lattice (a connected, loop-free graph) that the random first-order phase transition in the connectivity also drives the onset of quantum conduction giving rise to a new type of metal-insulator transition. Finally, we conduct level spacing analysis to go beyond the random phase approximation. This analysis reiterates our findings of a new random first-order phase transition in the world of disorder-driven metal-insulator transitions."
etd_273,"CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION, NATURAL HAZARD MITIGATION, AND INNOVATIVE RESPONSES",Public Administration,,"This dissertation is comprised of three essays which examine innovation, both technological and institutional, as a response aimed to adapting to climate change and natural disasters. Specifically, the first two papers seek to understand the drivers and implications of adaptation-related technological innovations. The third paper draws on the policy innovation theory to examine factors that shape the decision of state governments to engage in comprehensive climate adaptation planning.In Chapter 1, I examine the drivers of technical innovation as an important form of adaptation by investigating the impact of three types of natural disasters—floods, droughts and earthquakes—on the patenting activities of their respective mitigation technologies. Using patent and disaster damage data, this study is the first to empirically examine adaptation responses across multiple sectors at the country level. My empirical analysis, using a panel of 28 countries over a period of 25 years, shows that a country’s risk-mitigating innovations increase significantly with the severity of disasters it has recently experienced, while the degree of impact varies across different types of disasters and technologies.In Chapter 2, I evaluate the effectiveness of the risk-mitigating innovations in reducing disaster impacts in the case of earthquakes. By conceptualizing adaptation as a learning process, I examine the effect of technical knowledge stocks, constructed by patent counts in quake-proof building technologies, and informal knowledge, measured by prior earthquake experiences, on reducing earthquake-related losses. Using a global cross section, I find that countries with more earthquake-mitigation technical innovations and more earthquake exposure in the past suffer fewer fatalities. This “learning-by-doing” effect is much larger in high-income countries, which suggests their stronger adaptive capacity.Finally, Chapter 3 focuses on climate adaptation planning in the U.S. by examining the factors that drive state governments to develop comprehensive adaptation plans. I use an event history analysis to examine both internal factors (states’ climate risks, adaptive capacity and political interests in climate change) and policy diffusion among states within the same climate regions. This study finds that the state-level adaptation decision is highly driven by the extreme weather events the state has recently experienced, and also associated with the state’s potential exposure to climate risks, income level, civic engagement and environmental preferences. By examining the motivation for and barriers to subnational adaptation responses, this research has important implications for environmental federalism and governance.From the innovation perspective, my dissertation contributes to a deeper understanding of adaptation as a dynamic social-learning process, and sheds light on what drives society to adapt to environmental changes and shocks. It also informs an integrated policy approach to facilitating efficient climate adaptation and natural hazard mitigation."
etd_731,Climatic Controls on the Porewater Chemistry of Mid-continental Wetlands,Earth Sciences,"Climate, Geochemistry, Peatlands, Porewater, Prairie Wetlands, Wetlands","Wetlands develop where climate and physiography conspire to maintain saturated soils at the land surface, support diverse plant and animal communities, and serve as globally important sinks for atmospheric carbon. The chemistry of wetland porewaters impacts near-surface biological communities and subsurface biogeochemical processes that influence carbon cycling in the environment. Wetland porewater chemistry is a dynamic byproduct of complex hydrogeological processes that cause meteoric waters to enter groundwater systems (recharge) or groundwater to flow to the land surface (discharge). Changes in climate can alter subsurface hydraulic gradients that determine the recharge and discharge functions of wetlands, which in turn control the hydrogeochemical evolution of wetland porewaters.The climate of mid-continental North America is influenced by competing air masses with vastly different temperature and moisture contents originating from the Pacific Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic. The interactions of these air masses result in large dynamic shifts of climate regimes characterized by decadal-scale oscillations between periods of drought and heavy rain. Over the course of the 20th century, a shift occurred towards wetter climate in the mid-continental region. This dissertation examines the impact of this climate shift on the porewater chemistry of two very different wetland systems, located only 350 km apart: the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) of northern Minnesota and the Cottonwood Lake Study Area (CLSA) of North Dakota. The former study site consists of a large (7,600 km2), circumboreal peatland that developed an extensive blanket of peat over the last ~5000 years on a relatively flat glacial lake bed within a sub-humid to semi-arid climate gradient characterized by small annual atmospheric moisture surpluses and frequent droughts. The latter study site consists of a 0.92 km2 complex of small (meter-scale) “prairie pothole” wetlands located on a hummocky glacial stagnation moraine under semi-arid climate where wetlands frequently fill and dry with surface ponds over low-permeability glacial till in response to snowmelt runoff and evapotranspiration. Both sites have been the subject of long-term hydrological study since c. 1980 and are well-established examples of the sensitivity of wetland functions to changes in climate.The first chapter of this dissertation utilizes a semi-conservative tracer suite (pH, Ca, Mg, Sr, 87Sr/86Sr) to fingerprint discharge of calcareous groundwater to GLAP peat along a ~6 km transect from a bog crest downslope to an internal fen water track and bog islands. However, stable isotopes of the peat porewaters (?18O and ?2H) show that the subsurface throughout the entire study area is currently flushed with recharge from the near surface peat. I hypothesize that back-diffusion of groundwater-derived solutes from the peat matrix to active pore-spaces has allowed the geochemical signal from paleo-hydrogeologic discharge to persist into the current regime of dilute recharge. This effect promotes methane generation in the peatland subsurface by allowing transport of labile carbon compounds from the land surface to depth while maintaining geochemical conditions (i.e. pH) in the deep peat favorable to biogenic methane production. The results of this study show that autogenic hydrogeochemical feedback mechanisms contribute to the resilience of peatlands systems and associated ecological functions against climate change.The second chapter of this dissertation consists of a detailed geoelectrical survey of a well-studied, closed-basin prairie wetland (P1) in the CLSA that has experienced record drought and heavy rains (i.e. deluge) during the late 20th century. Subsurface storage of sulfate (SO4) salts allows many such closed-basin prairie wetlands to maintain moderate surface water salinities (TDS from 1 to 10 g L-1) that influence communities of aquatic biota. I imaged saline lenses of sulfate-rich porewater (TDS > 10 g L-1) in wetland sediments beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland and within the currently ponded area along the shoreline of a prior pond stand. Analyses of long-term (1979 – 2014) groundwater and surface water levels in the wetland suggest that the saline lenses formed during paleo-droughts when the groundwater levels dropped below the wetland bed and are stable in the subsurface on at least centennial timescales. I hypothesize a “drought-induced recharge” mechanism by which wetlands maintain moderate surface water salinity by subsurface storage during droughts when the wetlands dry and intermittent runoff events flush surface salts down secondary porosity created by desiccation fractures and terrestrial plant roots. Drought-derived saline groundwater has the potential to increase wetland salinity during record wet climate conditions currently prevalent in the Prairie Pothole Region.The third chapter of this dissertation extends the findings of the second chapter by a detailed geochemical survey of wetland porewater, pond water, and upland groundwater in the P1 basin. I use a natural geochemical tracer suite of halogens (Cl, Br, and I) to better understand the hydrogeochemical evolution of saline groundwater in the wetland subsurface during prior droughts. I found that saline porewater lenses contain SO4, Cl, and Br that are ~6x more concentrated from levels measured in the surface pond, due to the effects of evapo-concentration and recharge during paleo-droughts. However, I found the highest concentrations of porewater iodine (up to ~4 µM; the highest dissolved iodine concentration ever reported for a terrestrial aquatic system) occurred in vertical profiles above the saline lenses. I hypothesize that chromatographic separation of iodine from SO4, Cl, and Br occurs during droughts when sedimentary iodine oxidizes from its reduced forms (I- and organically bound I) to the less-mobile iodate compound (IO3-). Understanding the hydrogeochemical evolution and composition of drought-derived, saline groundwater can be used to fingerprint sources of salinity to wetland ponds during the record wet climate conditions currently prevalent in the Prairie Pothole Region.The three studies that comprise this dissertation illustrate diverse and complicated ways by which different wetland systems store and release salinity to their porewaters under dry and wet climate conditions. In the GLAP, geochemical buffering from the peat matrix stabilizes subsurface biogeochemical processing against the effects of climate change. At the CLSA, subsurface salinity storage during droughts allows closed-basin prairie wetlands to maintain moderate surface water salinities under semi-arid climate, which can be re-released back to wetland surface ponds during wetter conditions. These studies both have practical applications for forecasting the response of mid-continental wetlands to changes in climate, and highlight autogenic hydrogeochemical feedback mechanisms that help wetlands stabilize their ecological and biogeochemical functions under a changing climate."
etd_641,Cognitive Radio Systems: Performance Analysis and Optimal Resource Allocation,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Cognitive radio, energy efficiency, imperfect channel sensing, Optimal resource allocation, QoS constraints, Wireless Communications","Rapid growth in the use of wireless services coupled with inefficient utilization of scarce spectrum resources has led to the analysis and development of cognitive radio systems. Cognitive radio systems provide dynamic and more efficient utilization of the available spectrum by allowing unlicensed users (i.e., cognitive or secondary users) to access the frequency bands allocated to the licensed users (i.e., primary users) without causing harmful interference to the primary user transmissions. The central goal of this thesis is toconduct a performance analysis and obtain throughput- and energy-efficient optimal resource allocation strategies for cognitive radio systems. Cognitive radio systems, which employ spectrum sensing mechanisms to learn the channel occupancy by primary users, generally operate under sensing uncertainty arising due to false alarms and miss-detections. This thesis analyzes the performance of cognitive radio systems in a practical setting with imperfect spectrum sensing.In the first part of the thesis, optimal power adaptation schemes that maximize the achievable rates of cognitive users with arbitrary input distributions in underlay cognitive radio systems subject to transmit and interference power constraints are studied. Simpler approximations of optimal power control policies in the low-power regime are determined. Low-complexity optimal power control algorithms are proposed.Next, energy efficiency is considered as the performance metric and power allocation strategies that maximize the energy efficiency of cognitive users in the presence of time-slotted primary users are identified. The impact of different levels of channel knowledge regarding the transmission link between the secondary transmitter and secondary receiver, and the interference link between the secondary transmitter and primary receiver on the optimal power allocation is addressed. In practice, the primary user may change its status during the transmission phase of the secondary users. In such cases, the assumption of time-slotted primary user transmission no longer holds. With this motivation, the spectral and energy efficiency in cognitive radio systems with unslotted primary users are analyzed and the optimal frame duration and energy-efficient optimal power control schemes subject to a collision constraint are jointly determined.The second line of research in this thesis focuses on symbol error rate performance of cognitive radio transmissions in the presence of imperfect sensing decisions. General formulations for the optimal decision rule and error probabilities for arbitrary modulation schemes are provided. The optimal decision rule for rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is characterized, and closed-form expressions for the average symbol error probability attained with the optimal detector under both transmit power and interference constraints are derived.Furthermore, throughput of cognitive radio systems for both fixed-rate and variable-rate transmissions in the finite-blocklength regime is studied. The maximum constant arrival rates that the cognitive radio channel can support with finite blocklength codes while satisfying statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints imposed as limitations on the buffer violation probability are characterized.In the final part of the thesis, performance analysis in the presence of QoS requirements is extended to general wireless systems, and energy efficiency and throughput optimization with arbitrary input signaling are studied when statistical QoS constraints are imposed as limitations on the buffer violation probability. Effective capacity is chosen as the performance metric to characterize the maximum throughput subject to such buffer constraints by capturing the asymptotic decay-rate of buffer occupancy. Initially, constant-rate source is considered and subsequently random arrivals are taken into account."

Participants consisted of sixteen sibling pairs between the ages of eight and fourteen who were grouped into the high or low group for number of intrathecal chemotherapies (IT), and then regrouped for high or low time off therapy (TOT). Participants were administered a battery of cognitive, achievement, and neuropsychological tests. Matched sibling difference scores from these tests were analyzed. Results found that children with ALL performed in the average range, although below their healthy siblings in some domains, indicating that treatments appear to be doing less harm than anticipated from the past literature. Results indicate that on reading composite (comprehension and pseudoword reading) and math reasoning the high IT children with ALL, when compared with low IT children with ALL, performed more poorly than their healthy siblings. A large effect size for intelligence quotient indicated that high IT children with ALL, when compared with low IT children with ALL, performed more poorly than their healthy siblings. Large effect sizes also were noted for time off therapy (TOT) for reading composite and math reasoning, with the high TOT children with ALL performing more poorly than the low TOT children with ALL, relative to their healthy siblings. Nevertheless, there is cause for optimism.This study replicated prior research on the effects of high number of intrathecal chemotherapies on the intellectual, reading, and math performance of children with ALL, with late effects becoming most apparent at five or more years post therapy. However, post hoc analyses cautioned that these results should be interpreted conservatively, given the study’s methodological limitations."
eecs_etd_333,Collaborative Estimation in Distributed Sensor Networks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Baseline Drift, Estimaton Theory, Spatial Collaboration, Spatial Whitening","Networks of smart ultra-portable devices are already indispensable in our lives, augmenting our senses and connecting our lives through real time processing and communication of sensory (e.g., audio, video, location) inputs. Though usually hidden from the user's sight, the engineering of these devices involves fierce tradeoffs between energy availability (battery sizes impact portability) and signal processing / communication capability (which impacts the ""smartness"" of the devices). The goal of this dissertation is to provide a fundamental understanding and characterization of these tradeoffs in the context of a sensor network, where the goal is to estimate a common signal by coordinating a multitude of battery-powered sensor nodes. Most of the research so far has been based on two key assumptions --""distributed processing"" and ""temporal independence"" -- that lend analytical tractability to the problem but otherwise are often found lacking in practice. This dissertation introduces novel techniques to relax these assumptions -- leading to vastly efficient energy usage in typical networks (up to 20% savings) and new insights on the quality of inference. For example, the phenomenon of sensor drift is ubiquitous in applications such as air-quality monitoring, oceanography and bridge monitoring, where calibration is often difficult and costly. This dissertation provides an analytical framework linking the state of calibration to the overall uncertainty of the inferred parameters.In distributed estimation, sensor nodes locally process their observed data and send the resulting messages to a sink, which combines the received messages to produce a final estimate of the unknown parameter. In this dissertation, this problem is generalized and called ""collaborative estimation"", where some sensors can potentially have access to the observations from neighboring sensors and use that information to enhance the quality of their messages sent to the sink, while using the same (or lower) energy resources. This is motivated by the fact that inter-sensor communication may be possible if sensors are geographically close. As demonstrated in this dissertation, collaborative estimation is particularly effective in ""energy-skewed"" and ""information-skewed"" networks, where some nodes may have larger batteries than others and similarly some nodes may be more informative (less noisy) compared to others. Since the node with the largest battery is not necessarily also the most informative, the proposed inter-sensor collaboration provides a natural framework to route the relevant information from low-energy-high-quality nodes to high-energy-low-quality nodes in a manner that enhances the overall power-distortion tradeoff.This dissertation also analyzes how time-correlated measurement noise affects the uncertainties of inferred parameters. Imperfections such as baseline drift in sensors result in a time-correlated additive component in the measurement noise. Though some models of drift have been reported in the literature earlier, none of the studies have considered the effect of drifting sensors on an estimation application. In this dissertation, approximate measures of estimation accuracy (Cramer-Rao bounds) are derived as a function of physical properties of sensors -- namely the drift strength, correlation (Markov) factor and the time-elapsed since last calibration. For stationary drift (Markov factor less than one), it is demonstrated that the first order effect of drift is asymptotically equivalent to scaling the measurement noise by an appropriate factor. When the drift is non-stationary (Markov factor equal to one), it is established that the constant part of a signal can only be estimated inconsistently (with non-zero asymptotic variance). The results help quantify the notions that measurements taken sooner after calibration result in more accurate inference."

Using this theoretical approach I focus on two “sites” or cases of musical and kinetic practices in the contemporary United States: mainline Protestant hymn singing and contra dancing.  I argue that this approach helps us to better understand how these practices function religiously for participants.  These practices are of particular interest because of their participatory dimensions and the ways they articulate different relationships between bodies and music and between bodies and other bodies, as compared with the more common presentational modes of engaging in music in mainstream consumer culture.  In this respect they facilitate the actualization of counter-hegemonic potentials for religious life and human flourishing."
etd_330,Collective Phenomena in Active Systems,Physics,"Active Matter, Cell Mechanics, Collective Phenomena, Nonequilibrium, Pattern Formation, Self-propelled particle","This dissertation investigates collective phenomena in active systems of biological relavance across length scales, ranging from intracellular actin systems to bird flocks. The study has been conducted via theoretical modeling and computer simulations using tools from soft condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The work has been organized into two parts through five chapters. In part one (chapter 2 to 3), continuum theories have been utilized to study pattern formation in bacteria suspensions, actomyosin systems and bird flocks, whose dynamics is described generically within the framework of polar active fluids. The continuum field equations have been written down phenomenogically and derived rigorously through explicit coarse-graining of corresponding microscopic equations of motion. We have investigated the effects of alignment interaction, active motility, non-conserved density, and rotational inertia on pattern formation in active systems. In part two (chapter 4 to 5), computer simulations have been performed to study the self-organization and mechanical properties of dense active systems. A minimal self-propelled particle (SPP) model has been utilized to understand the aggregation and segregation of active systems under confinement (Chapter 4), where an active pressure has been defined for the first time to characterize the mechanical state of the active system. The same model is utilized in Chapter 5 to understand the self-assembly of passive particles in an active bath."
etd_688,Combining Smart Material Platforms and New Computational Tools to Investigate Cell Motility Behavior and Control,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Bioengineering, Biomechanics, Biophysics, Cell motility, Time-lapse microscopy, Tissue engineering","Cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions play a critical role in regulating important biological phenomena, including morphogenesis, tissue repair, and disease states. In vivo, cells are subjected to various mechanical, chemical, and electrical cues to collectively guide their functionality within a specific microenvironment. To better understand the mechanisms regulating cell adhesive, differentiation, and motility dynamics, researchers have developed in vitro platforms to synthetically mimic native tissue responses. While important information about cell-ECM interactions have been revealed using these systems, a knowledge gap currently exists regarding how cell responses in static environments relate to the dynamic cell-ECM interaction behaviors observed in vivo. Advances at the intersection of materials science, biophysics, and cell biology have recently enabled the production of dynamic ECM mimics where cells can be exposed to controlled mechanical, electrical or chemical cues to directly decouple cell-ECM related behaviors from cell-cell or cell-environmental factors. Utilization of these dynamic synthetic biomaterials will enable discovery of novel mechanisms fundamental in tissue development, homeostasis, repair, and disease.In this dissertation, the primary goal was to evaluate how mechanical changes in the ECM regulate cell motility and polarization responses. This was accomplished through two major aims: 1) by developing a modular image processing tool that could be applied in complex synthetic in vitro microenvironments to asses cell motility dynamics, and 2) to utilize that tool to advance understanding of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction processes associated with development, wound healing, and disease progression. Therefore, the first portion of this thesis (Chapters 2 and 3) dealt with proof of concept for our newly developed automated cell tracking system, termed ACTIVE (automated contour-based tracking for in vitro environments), while the second portion of this thesis (Chapter 4-7) addressed applying this system in multiple experimental designs to synthesize new knowledge regarding cell-ECM or cell-cell interactions.In Chapter 1, we introduced why cell-ECM interactions are essential for in vivo processes and highlighted the current state of the literature. In Chapter 2, we demonstrated that ACTIVE could achieve greater than 95% segmentation accuracy at multiple cell densities, while improving two-body cell-cell interaction error by up to 43%. In Chapter 3 we showed that ACTIVE could be applied to reveal subtle differences in fibroblast motility atop static wrinkled or static non-wrinkled surfaces at multiple cell densities. In Chapters 4 and 5, we characterized fibroblast motility and intracellular reorganization atop a dynamic shape memory polymer biomaterial, focusing on the role of the Rho-mediated pathway in the observed responses. We then utilized ACTIVE to identify differences in subpopulation dynamics of monoculture versus co-culture endothelial and smooth muscle cells (Chapter 6). In Chapter 7, we applied ACTIVE to investigate E. coli biofilm formation atop poly(dimethylsiloxane) surfaces with varying stiffness and line patterns. Finally, we presented a summary and future work in Chapter 8. Collectively, this work highlights the capabilities of the newly developed ACTIVE tracking system and demonstrates how to synthesize new information about mechanobiology and mechanotransduction processes using dynamic biomaterial platforms."
eng_etd_64,"Coming Home: Mobile Women, Non-Linear Temporalities, South Asian Diasporic Texts",English,"Globalization, Mobile Woman, Non-Linear Temporality, Queer Diaspora, Transnational Feminism, Transnational Modernism","Coming Home examines a set of feminist and proto-feminist texts across multiple genres and mediums (fiction, memoir and film) by women cultural producers in the South Asian diaspora over the last two decades. Common to these texts is the trope of the mobile woman who travels through non-linear space and time. The trope of the mobile woman has been a site of contestation between western colonial and liberal feminist scripts of rescue and patrilineal nationalist scripts of return in South Asia since the colonial times. In my dissertation, I argue that these apparently competing scripts of rescue and return, which have proliferated in the South Asian diaspora during the nineties and the 9/11 decade, are in fact ideologically twin narratives. Both prescribe a linear, singular, and fixed ""home"" for the mobile South Asian woman, and both rely on a linear and teleological understanding of modernity and temporality. With the intensification of neo-liberal capitalism and fundamentalist nationalist discourses of home and nation in South Asian political economies during the last two decades, these narratives of rescue and return have been increasingly used to justify colonial and xenophobic nationalist projects against the gendered, sexualized, and racialized Other in South Asian (alongside other ethnic) communities in both the global North and the global South. There has also been a disturbing revival of these scripts as interpretive frameworks within the reception of Third World women's cultural texts in the global North after 9/11. In turn, I examine how, and to what end and extent, my chosen cultural texts deploy non-linear temporal aesthetics to defamiliarize the trope of the South Asian woman as mobile/immobile woman, as witness-bearer, and as cultural producer in narratives of rescue and return. I contend that the non-linear temporal aesthetics--time-travel, palimpsestic memory, and non-metric chronotopes--in my chosen cultural texts are not inherently subversive, but when deployed within decolonial feminist frameworks, they can become powerful analytical and political strategies for disrupting both rescue and return scripts"
etd_405,Commercial Capital and the Political Economy of Agricultural Overproduction,Political Science,"agro-food systems, Cargill, commercial capital, global commodity / value chains, Marx, merchant capital","This dissertation examines the role of commercial capital in constructing and maintaining a globalized agro-food system undergirded by the overproduction of grain and other basic commodity crops. Drawing on Marx’s Capital, I develop a theory of commercial capital that delineates the accumulation strategies of transnational corporations governing the production and circulation of wage-goods through their control over global supply chains. Capitalism’s structural drive to maintain a cheap stock of wage-goods, as a universal source of relative surplus value, means that commercial capital faces difficulties in raising wage-good prices through the pursuit of monopoly power. Accordingly, commercial capital seeks monopsony power over its suppliers in order to widen chronically low profit margins, which are further offset by increasing the volume and velocity of commodities in circulation. The general effects of wage-good supply chains governed by commercial capital are heightened rates of labor exploitation and systematic overproduction.This theory of commercial capital is applied to the global grain economy, with specific attention to the Cargill Corporation, arguably the world’s most powerful agricultural commodities trader and food processor. Cargill’s high-volume, low-margin business model has rested upon the globalization of industrial grain production and the successful absorption of crop surpluses. Cargill has worked to construct the global grain economy in its own image by 1): putting downward price pressure on farmers through supply chain monopsony power; and 2): working within the state-capital nexus to institutionalize policies that promote systemic overproduction, global supply chain expansion, and surplus absorption. In the United States, Cargill and its agribusiness rivals won the institutionalization of the grain overproduction regime during the depths of the Great Depression by coopting large commercial farmers with a weak supply management system that has been ineffectual in curbing overproduction. Since the postwar era, the progressive retrenchment of price supports and the further weakening of supply management schemes illustrates the power of the overproduction coalition in setting the developmental trajectory of the American, and global, agro-food systems.Overproduction is at the core of many problems facing the global agro-food system today, from depeasantization and the decline of smallholding to obesity and environmental degradation. The centrality of overproduction to Cargill’s business model suggests fundamental incompatibilities between our current food regime – a food regime governed by the logic of commercial capital – and an alternative system, democratically designed to sustainably maximize human developmental capacities."
eecs_etd_336,Common Information and Decentralized Inference with Dependent Observations,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Common information, Data reduction, Decentralized inference, Dependent observations, Sufficiency statistics","Wyner's common information was originally defined for a pair of dependent discrete random variables. This thesis generalizes its definition in two directions: the number of dependent variables can be arbitrary, so are the alphabets of those random variables. New properties are determined for the generalized Wyner's common information of multiple dependent variables. More importantly, a lossy source coding interpretation of Wyner's common information is developed using the Gray-Wyner network. It is established that the common information equals to the smallest common message rate when the total rate is arbitrarily close to the rate distortion function with joint decoding if the distortions are within some distortion region.The application of Wyner's common information to inference problems is also explored in the thesis. A central question is under what conditions does Wyner's common information capture the entire information about the inference object. Under a simple Bayesian model, it is established that for infinitely exchangeable random variables that the common information is asymptotically equal to the information of the inference object. For finite exchangeable random variables, connection between common information and inference performance metrics are also established.The problem of decentralized inference is generally intractable with conditional dependent observations. A promising approach for this problem is to utilize a hierarchical conditional independence model. Utilizing the hierarchical conditional independence model, we identify a more general condition under which the distributed detection problem becomes tractable, thereby broadening the classes of distributed detection problems with dependent observations that can be readily solved.We then develop the sufficiency principle for data reduction for decentralized inference. For parallel networks, the hierarchical conditional independence model is used to obtain conditions such that local sufficiency implies global sufficiency. For tandem networks, the notion of conditional sufficiency is introduced and the related theory and tools are developed. Connections between the sufficiency principle and distributed source coding problems are also explored. Furthermore, we examine the impact of quantization on decentralized data reduction. The conditions under which sufficiency based data reduction with quantization constraints is optimal are identified. They include the case when the data at decentralized nodes are conditionally independent as well as a class of problems with conditionally dependent observations that admit conditional independence structure through the hierarchical conditional independence model."
it_etd_73,Community Interest as An Indicator for Ranking,Information Science and Technology,"Community Interest, Evaluation, Information Retrieval, Methodology, Ranking, User Study","Ranking documents in response to users' information needs is a challenging task, due, in part, to the dynamic nature of users' interests with respect to a query. We hypothesize that the interests of a given user are similar to the interests of the broader community of which he or she is a part and propose an innovative method that uses social media to characterize the interests of the community and use this characterization to improve future rankings. By generating a community interest vector (CIV) and community interest language model (CILM) for a given query, we use community interest to alter the ranking score of individual documents retrieved by the query. The CIV or CILM is based on a continuously updated set of recent (daily or past few hours) user oriented text data. The interest based ranking method is evaluated by using Amazon Turk to against relevance based ranking and search engines' ranking results. Overall, the experiment result shows community interest is an effective indicator for dynamic ranking."
etd_344,Comparison of Cost Function Against Positional Analysis for Automated Tracking of Three-Cell Interactions,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Automated Cell Tracking, MATLAB, Orthogonal Design, Weighting Factor Optimization","Localization and tracking of cells generates raw digital information from microscopy images, including images of stained nuclei and highly precise determination of central positions of cells, which can be analyzed for investigation of cell motility. In a previous study by this group, an algorithm termed automated contour-based tracking for in vitro environments (ACTIVE) was established for tracking large cell populations for long periods of time. For the two-cell interaction events on which ACTIVE was initially focused, error rate was reduced as much as 43% compared to a traditional positional analysis algorithm by Kilfoil and colleagues. In the present thesis, we investigated whether the ACTIVE algorithm could be improved when applied to a more complicated condition: three-cell interactions. To determine whether modification of the ACTIVE algorithms could allow ACTIVE to outperform the Kilfoil benchmark method when applied not only to two-cell interaction cases but also to three-cell interaction cases, two approaches were developed and studied: 1) optimization of the existing ACTIVE cost-function weighting factors by orthogonal design with addition of two new factors, velocity and directionality, and detection of ranges and effects for all factors, and 2) modification of the circumstances under which the Kilfoil approach and the cost function approach were executed. We found the position factor to be the most important and accurate among all the factors, and optimized all factors. What is more, the directionality was determined to be the second most significant factor of the cost function for correctly tracking cells. However, modification of neither the position nor directionality factor could achieve higher accuracy than the Kilfoil method. Having evaluated the new strategy that combines both the cost function and the Kilfoil method, we found that the new strategy did not result in higher accuracy for three-cell interactions, as compared to the pure Kilfoil benchmark method. The accuracy of the new strategy was 6% lower on average than the Kilfoil method. Although the results of the present work do not yet achieve a method for analysis of three-cell interactions that outperforms purely positional analysis, the work provides a method for optimization of the cost function and new understanding of characteristics of three-cell interactions that lead to reduced accuracy in the cost function and/or positional (Kilfoil) approaches."
geo_etd_78,"Competing Sovereignties: Corporate Social Responsibility, Oil Extraction, and Indigenous Subjectivity in Ecuador",Geography,"Corporate social responsibility, Ecuador, Governmentality, Indigenous peoples, Neoliberal natures, Oil","Corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs developed in recent years as the business response to social and environmental criticism of corporate operations, and are most debated in those societies where neoliberalism emerged most prominently, the United States and the United Kingdom. My dissertation expands these debates investigating the CSR programs of a Spanish-owned multinational oil company, Repsol-YPF operating in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. It explores CSR programs as institutions that can facilitate ongoing resource extraction, and particular technologies of rule that serve to discipline indigenous peoples at the point of extraction. I conducted an institutional ethnography to examine the social relationships produced through CSR programs, and contend that the relationships formed within CSR programs enable ongoing resource extraction. This dissertation argues that CSR programs produce entanglements between state, corporate and indigenous actors that lead to competing and conflicting spaces of governance in Ecuador. These entanglements reflect the Ecuadorian state's attempts to 'erase' indigenous difference in the name of securing wealth and membership in the nation-state. In turn, CSR programs can both contain indigenous mobilization and resistance in Ecuador, but also highlight indigenous difference and rights and access to resources, predicated on membership in the nation-state. To that end, the dissertation is attentive to the ambivalence and uncertainty of indigenous actors produced through engagement with corporate capital, and suggests that ambivalence can also be a productive space."
etd_383,Composite Minimization: Proximity Algorithms and Their Applications,Mathematics,,"Image and signal processing problems of practical importance, such as incompletedata recovery and compressed sensing, are often modeled as nonsmooth optimizationproblems whose objective functions are the sum of two terms, each of which is thecomposition of a prox-friendly function with a matrix. Therefore, there is a practicalneed to solve such optimization problems. Besides the nondifferentiability of theobjective functions of the associated optimization problems and the larger dimensionof the underlying images and signals, the sum of the objective functions is not,in general, prox-friendly, which makes solving the problems challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed in literature to attack these problems by making use of the prox-friendly functions in the problems. However, the efficiency of these algorithmsrelies heavily on the underlying structures of the matrices, particularly for large scaleoptimization problems. In this dissertation, we propose a novel algorithmic frameworkthat exploits the availability of the prox-friendly functions, without requiringany structural information of the matrices. This makes our algorithms suitable forlarge scale optimization problems of interest. We also prove the convergence of thedeveloped algorithms.This dissertation has three main parts. In part 1, we consider the minimizationof functions that are the sum of the compositions of prox-friendly functions withmatrices. We characterize the solutions to the associated optimization problems asthe solutions of fixed point equations that are formulated in terms of the proximity operators of the dual of the prox-friendly functions. By making use of the flexibilityprovided by this characterization, we develop a block Gauss-Seidel iterative schemefor finding a solution to the optimization problem and prove its convergence. Wediscuss the connection of our developed algorithms with some existing ones and pointout the advantages of our proposed scheme.In part 2, we give a comprehensive study on the computation of the proximityoperator of the ?p-norm with 0 ? p < 1. Nonconvexity and non-smoothness havebeen recognized as important features of many optimization problems in image andsignal processing. The nonconvex, nonsmooth ?p-regularization has been recognizedas an efficient tool to identify the sparsity of wavelet coefficients of an image or signalunder investigation. To solve an ?p-regularized optimization problem, the proximityoperator of the ?p-norm needs to be computed in an accurate and computationallyefficient way. We first study the general properties of the proximity operator of the?p-norm. Then, we derive the explicit form of the proximity operators of the ?p-normfor p ? {0, 1/2, 2/3, 1}. Using these explicit forms and the properties of the proximityoperator of the ?p-norm, we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the proximityoperator of the ?p-norm for any p between 0 and 1.In part 3, the usefulness of the research results developed in the previous twoparts is demonstrated in two types of applications, namely, image restoration andcompressed sensing. A comparison with the results from some existing algorithmsis also presented. For image restoration, the results developed in part 1 are applied to solve the ?2-TV and ?1-TV models. The resulting restored images have higherpeak signal-to-noise ratios and the developed algorithms require less CPU time thanstate-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, for compressed sensing applications, ouralgorithm has smaller ?2- and ??-errors and shorter computation times than state-ofthe-art algorithms. For compressed sensing with the ?p-regularization, our numericalsimulations show smaller ?2- and ??-errors than that from the ?0-regularization and?1-regularization. In summary, our numerical simulations indicate that not only canour developed algorithms be applied to a wide variety of important optimizationproblems, but also they are more accurate and computationally efficient than stateof-the-art algorithms."
etd_704,Computer Vision Algorithms for Mobile Camera Applications,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Computer Vision, Fall Detection, Image Processing, Mobile Cameras, Step Counting, Traffic Sign Detection","Wearable and mobile sensors have found widespread use in recent years due to their ever-decreasing cost, ease of deployment and use, and ability to provide continuous monitoring as opposed to sensors installed at fixed locations. Since many smart phones are now equipped with a variety of sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, microphone and camera, it has become more feasible to develop algorithms for activity monitoring, guidance and navigation of unmanned vehicles, autonomous driving and driver assistance, by using data from one or more of these sensors. In this thesis, we focus on multiple mobile camera applications, and present lightweight algorithms suitable for embedded mobile platforms. The mobile camera scenarios presented in the thesis are: (i) activity detection and step counting from wearable cameras, (ii) door detection for indoor navigation of unmanned vehicles, and (iii) traffic sign detection from vehicle-mounted cameras.First, we present a fall detection and activity classification system developed for embedded smart camera platform CITRIC. In our system, the camera platform is worn by the subject, as opposed to static sensors installed at fixed locations in certain rooms, and, therefore, monitoring is not limited to confined areas, and extends to wherever the subject may travel including indoors and outdoors. Next, we present a real-time smart phone-based fall detection system, wherein we implement camera and accelerometer based fall-detection on Samsung Galaxy S™ 4. We fuse these two sensor modalities to have  a more robust fall detection system. Then, we introduce a fall detection algorithm with autonomous thresholding using relative-entropy within the class of Ali-Silvey distance measures. As another wearable camera application, we present a footstep counting algorithm using a smart phone camera. This algorithm provides more accurate step-count compared to using only accelerometer data in smart phones and smart watches at various body locations.As a second mobile camera scenario, we study autonomous indoor navigation of unmanned vehicles. A novel approach is proposed to autonomously detect and verify doorway openings by using the  Google Project Tango™ platform.The third mobile camera scenario involves vehicle-mounted cameras. More specifically, we focus on traffic sign detection from lower-resolution and noisy videos captured from vehicle-mounted cameras. We present a new method for accurate traffic sign detection, incorporating Aggregate Channel Features and Chain Code Histograms, with the goal of providing much faster training and testing, and comparable or better performance, with respect to deep neural network approaches, without requiring specialized processors. Proposed computer vision algorithms provide promising results for various useful applications despite the limited energy and processing capabilities of mobile devices."

In the U.S. energy market, although wind energy is one of the fastest increasing sources of electricity generation (by annual installed capacity addition), and is expected to play an important role in the future energy demographics of this country, it has also been plagued by project underperformance and concept-to-installation delays.There are various factors affecting the quality of a wind energy project, and most of these factors are strongly coupled in their influence on the socio-economic, production, and environmental objectives of a wind energy project. To develop wind farms that are profitable, reliable, and meet community acceptance, it is critical to accomplish balance between these objectives, and therefore a clean understanding of how different design and natural factors jointly impact these objectives is much needed.In this research, a Multi-objective Wind Farm Design (MOWFD) methodology is developed, which analyzes and integrates the impact of various factors on the conceptual design of wind farms. This methodology contributes three major advancements to the wind farm design paradigm: (I) provides a new understanding of the impact of key factors on the wind farm performance under the use of different wake models; (II) explores the crucial tradeoffs between energy production, cost of energy, and the quantitative role of land usage in wind farm layout optimization (WFLO); and (III) makes novel advancements on mixed-discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm through a multi-domain diversity preservation concept, to solve complex multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems.A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the wind farm power generation is performed to understand and compare the impact of land configuration, installed capacity decisions, incoming wind speed, and ambient turbulence on the performance of conventional array layouts and optimized wind farm layouts. For array-like wind farms, the relative importance of each factor was found to vary significantly with the choice of wake models, i.e., appreciable differences in the sensitivity indices (of up to 70%) were observed across the different wake models. In contrast, for optimized wind farm layouts, the choice of wake models was observed to have no significant impact on the sensitivity indices.The MOWFD methodology is designed to explore the tradeoffs between the concerned performance objectives and simultaneously optimize the location of turbines, the type of turbines, and the land usage. More importantly, it facilitates WFLO without prescribed conditions (e.g., fixed wind farm boundaries and number of turbines), thereby allowing a more flexible exploration of the feasible layout solutions than is possible with other existing WFLO methodologies. In addition, a novel parameterization of the Pareto is performed to quantitatively explore how the best tradeoffs between energy production and land usage vary with the installed capacity decisions. The key to the various complex MO-WFLOs performed here is the unique set of capabilities offered by the new Multi-Objective Mixed-Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (MO-MDPSO) algorithm, developed, tested and extensively used in this dissertation.The MO-MDPSO algorithm is capable of dealing with a plethora of problem complexities, namely: multiple highly nonlinear objectives, constraints, high design space dimensionality, and a mixture of continuous and discrete design variables. Prior to applying MO-MDPSO to effectively solve complex WFLO problems, this new algorithm was tested on a large and diverse suite of popular benchmark problems; the convergence and Pareto coverage offered by this algorithm was found to be competitive with some of the most popular MOO algorithms (e.g., GAs). The unique potential of the MO-MDPSO algorithm is further established through application to the following complex practical engineering problems: (I) a disc brake design problem, (II) a multi-objective wind farm layout optimization problem, simultaneously optimizing the location of turbines, the selection of turbine types, and the site orientation, and (III) simultaneously minimizing land usage and maximizing capacity factors under varying land plot availability."

Specifically, the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) and the Change Facilitator Stages of Concern Questionnaire (CFSoCQ) were administered three times during the initial year of implementation of a new mathematics program in a small city school district in Central New York State. Qualitative methodology included focus groups with teachers and with school leaders, and semi-structured interviews with each school leader. (N=12 teachers and N=5 school leaders).Findings from this study indicated that school leaders were unconcerned about the innovation and about becoming better change facilitators. School leaders were concerned about other aspects of their leadership including safety, discipline, parent concerns and staffing. Teachers' Self concerns in the quantitative data combined with Consequence concerns in the qualitative data suggest that teachers want to feel efficacious and they are concerned about their students' success. Additionally, teachers' concerns were intense around opportunities for collaboration. Interventions employed by principals largely focused on Informational and Management concerns and, therefore, alignment was low relative to teachers' highest concerns."

This qualitative study, situated within the social networking site Facebook, as well as an urban public library, explored the ways in which black adolescent girls make meaning of culturally relevant texts. The focus of this inquiry was to examine broadly how societal, institutional, and situational factors influence the ways black adolescent girls make meaning of street literature texts. Three interconnected research questions drove this study: (a) How do media representations of black adolescent girls influence how they see themselves? (Societal); (b) How do black adolescents girls make meaning of street literature texts in out-of-school spaces? (Institutional); and (c) How does the role of the researcher influence the ways in which black adolescent girls make meaning of street literature texts? (Situational).Three theoretical frameworks, including Reader Response Theory, New Literacy Studies, and Hip-hop Feminist Theory (3rd Wave) drove this qualitative study. Several ethnographic methods were employed, including audiotaped transcriptions of fieldnotes, online book discussions, focus group interviews, participant journal writing, and a researcher journal. Critical Discourse Analysis was the analytical tool employed to interpret data (Fairclough, 1989; Rogers, 2003). Concrete Roses contributes to the current body of literature by positioning black adolescent girls at the center and bringing visibility to the ways in which their positionalities (raced, gendered, and classed identities) influence how they ""do"" literacy. By doing so, it addresses the dearth of research in LIS scholarship focusing on the intersection of raced, gendered, and classed identities. Concrete Roses also contributes to the current body of literature by addressing educational approaches to urban literacies and highlighting pedagogical strategies designed to bridge black adolescent girls' out-of-school and in-school literacy and language practices. Overall, Concrete Roses stresses the importance of creating inclusive learning environments, in order to effectively meet the literacy and language practices of diverse populations."
etd_163,Confessional Politics and Religious Identity in the Early Jesuit Missions to the Ottoman Empire,History,"Early modern Catholicism, Eastern Christianity, Mediterranean World, Ottoman Empire, Society of Jesus","In its first century, the Society of Jesus undertook numerous missions to the various Christian communities of the Ottoman Empire. In each instance, the Jesuits faced obstacles to their efforts to Catholicize the Christian Orient. Through an examination of the Jesuit experience in the early modern Ottoman Empire, I argue that particular historiographical trends concerning confession-building, early modern empire-building, and globalization need to be revised. First, rather than seeing the consolidation and alliance of religious practice and political allegiance as institutionally forced through negotiation and resistance, I argue that the unique experiences of individuals demonstrate how confessionalization was not just a question of institutional control or communal solidarity, but was driven by individual desires to conform to a confessional identity, a process I call self-confessionalization. Second, this project revises the historiographical notion of the Jesuits as participants in European imperialism. I argue against the notion that the Jesuits were willful agents of European monarchs and the papacy, but rather that the Jesuits were forced to negotiate their place between Rome and the Ottoman world. They had to amend their missionary efforts based on the circumstances in which they found themselves, and this often ran contrary to the wishes of their patrons. Finally, I argue that the Jesuits in the early modern Ottoman Empire were equal participants in a global process of group identity formation that centered on the development and maintenance of borders along the lines of religious confession and larger cultural identities. They participated in this global exchange on both individual and collective levels, demonstrating that the early stages of globalization depended upon cooperation between the major powers of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In sum, the Jesuit missions to the Ottoman world lay bare the existence of intersecting processes of religious solidification, empire-building, and global interconnectedness that are all indicative of the collaborative character of the early modern world."
etd_286,Constructing a Counter-Discourse: Agroecological Formação at the MST's Milton Santos School,Geography,"Agrarian Reform, Agroecology, Gramsci, MST, Popular Education, Social Movements","The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (Movimento Sem Terra, MST) is one of the largest social movements in the world. Situated in a country with extremely unequal land distribution, the MST was originally concerned with obtaining land for agrarian reform settlements through the occupation of latifúndia (large estates of the landed elite). However, after realizing its struggle over land rights was rooted in deeper structural issues in Brazilian society, the MST broadened its goals to seeking wider societal change. Over the past thirty years, it has evolved into a movement that pursues social justice by challenging dominant capitalist discourses. This thesis focuses on one tactic in the pursuit of this goal: the movement’s incorporation of agroecology into its official discourse and the subsequent establishment of agroecological schools to disseminate agroecological knowledge across the movement. It argues that adoption of agroecology as both a set of scientific agricultural practices and a new way of life serves as a key strategy in the MST’s counter-hegemonic project. Drawing on Antonio Gramsci’s theory of hegemony, complemented by Michel Foucault’s understanding of discourse, this thesis traces the incorporation of agroecology as a strategy in the MST’s “war of position” to change the “common sense” in Brazilian and wider global discourses on agrarian reform. Through peasant pedagogy (“formação”) – both in the classroom and through daily activities – the MST’s agroecological project seeks to construct new understandings of people’s relationships with nature and each other."
etd_83,"CONSTRUCTING THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS: Development of the Automotive Industry in Changchun and Shenyang, China",Geography,"Automotive Industry, China, FDI, Global Production Networks, Innovation and technology, State","The automotive industry has long been of interests to economic geographers because of social and political importance and the crucial role the state has played in supporting local firms and coordinating relationships between suppliers and assemblers. In the Chinese automotive industry, since the 1980s, the ""exchange market for technology"" policy aimed to foster industrial development through introducing foreign capital and technology by forming joint ventures. However, it is found that the Chinese automotive industry has become more dependent on foreign technologies and failed to obtain indigenous innovations as Japan and Korea. In my two cases in Changchun and Shenyang, I find that the technological dependency on FDI undermined the contribution the rapid market and production expansion of the automotive industry could make to regional development.Although the lack of innovation is identified as a key factor, I argue that it is insufficient in providing a deep-rooted explanation. My case studies demonstrate how the ""exchange market for technology"" policy has constructed technological dependency through restructuring China's institutional arrangements that prioritize foreign technology and hinder indigenous innovation. Contrary to those scholars that advocate technology transfer as an effective strategy for development, especially among developmental states, I instead understand technology as being political; it is a means for both development and institutional reform. Through disclosing the power relations embedded within the foreign technologies, I investigate the industrial restructuring and institutional transformation it brings in the technology transfer process.However, by considering the impact of WTO on the Chinese automotive industrial policy, I show how these transformations have been a result of the political struggles within the state elites and how these relations have been rearranged in ways that accord with an increasing engagement with the neoliberal global economy. I demonstrate it is crucial to understand the differences and connections between growth and development, between ""made in China"" and ""made by China"", paying special attention to their material and institutional conceptualizations of geography."
etd_626,"CONSUMERISM, SOCIAL PRACTICE, AND SLAVERY: CONSUMER PRACTICES AMONG ENSLAVED LABORERS AT POPLAR FOREST PLANTATION (1828-1861)",Anthropology,"consumerism, material culture, slavery, Virginia","This dissertation is a study of the intersections of slavery, daily practice, and consumerism of enslaved laborers at antebellum Poplar Forest plantation in Central Virginia. Key developments in the antebellum period, including expanded transportation options, industrialization, and increased slave leasing shaped the enslaved laborer’s lives. These factors resulted in increased access to the market economy for many enslaved laborers, which transformed social and economic relationships between whites and African Americans and among African Americans as well. The conditions that shaped this process varied according to regional differences, the forms of labor in which the enslaved were engaged, and the individual practices of slave owners. My work centers itself within the growing field of consumerism studies, which have been useful to scholars of slavery and post-emancipation African American communities, but have not been applied to slavery in the antebellum period of Central Virginia. By employing consumer strategies to negotiate the experiences of slavery and craft identities that resisted the imposed definition of “slave,” enslaved laborers gained a measure of control over their daily lives and degrees of personal empowerment. Enslaved men and women adapted to the uncertain realities of antebellum slavery by acquiring and using goods to shape their identities and to promote and maintain health and well-being for themselves and their families. This study demonstrates that control and empowerment were situational for enslaved laborers and they came with costs and benefits."
etd_482,Containment and Dewatering of Heavy Metal Contaminated Sediments using Reactive Soil Minerals and Cellulose Materials,Civil and Environmental Engineering,,"The aim of this study is to investigate effective and sustainable measures to contain heavy metal contaminated sediments inside a geotextile tube during dewatering process. The efficacy of cellulosic materials (Jute fibers, Peanut hull, and Kraft pulp) on adsorption of selected heavy metals (Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+) and dewatering performance inside a geotextile tube was studied by a series of Batch Adsorption and Pressure Filtration tests (PFT). The cellulosic materials were chosen keeping in mind their cost, accessibility, ease of handling and use, and sustainability. The studied adsorbents are inexpensive, easily available, and sustainable. In order to understand the optimum amount of cellulosic materials to be added into the slurry as well as the optimum mixing time for maximum removal, an independent study was conducted with the heavy metal ions and the cellulose materials. In this study, batch adsorption tests were conducted on a 500 ppm metal solution by changing the amount of cellulose materials from 0.5 g to 2g equilibrated for 4 hours. Two filtrate samples were collected at tested for metal concentration using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) at 0.5hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr to understand the time of mixing on removal efficiency of studied heavy metal ions. The adsorption data were fitted using Langmuir isotherm to quantify their maximum adsorption capacity to heavy metal ions. It was found out that among the studied metals, all adsorbents exhibited highest affinity towards Pb ions, the order being jute> peanut hull> kraft pulp. A removal efficiency of 47% and maximum adsorption capacity of 100 mg/g Pb ions was highest for all combinations of adsorbents and metal ions. A maximum removal efficiency of 28% of Cu was achieved by the kraft pulp and the decreasing affinity was kraft pulp>peanut hull>jute. The maximum adsorption capacity of kraft pulp determined from Langmuir isotherm for Cu was 13 mg/g. Similarly, kraft pulp exhibited highest affinity for Cd and Zn followed by peanut hull and jute. The removal efficiency of Cd and Zn by kraft pulp was almost 28%, significantly higher than 13% removal of Cu or Pb. The maximum adsorption capacity of kraft pulp for Cd and Zn were 24 mg/g and 11 mg/g respectively.It has been seen that the dredged sediments contain soil particles with varying sizes and properties. Hence, understanding the role of different sediments in adsorption and retention of heavy metal ions inside geotextile tube is very important to predict the fate of contaminants leaching out from the tubes. To address this issue, a separate study was conducted where two soil sediments, Tully coarse (55% coarse and 45% fine fractions), and Tully fines (100% fine fractions) were mixed with heavy metal solution (500 ppm-2500 ppm) to form a 15% solid concentration slurry. The slurries was mixed for 1 hour and the filtrate samples collected after mixing were tested for metal concentration using ICP-OES. Moreover, Kaolinite clay was also used in this study. It was seen from these tests that the presence of fine fractions, hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum, reactive clay minerals Illite and Chlorite, surface charge, and pH of a soil play dominant role in adsorption and retention of heavy metal ions specially Pb and Cu. Tully fine sediments exhibited excessively high affinity towards Pb as the more than 99% of Pb was adsorbed and retained. Tully coarse also had high affinity to Pb and Cu with removal efficiency ranging between 85-95%. Kaolinite (1:1 clay) being less reactive and having high molecular stability than most of the 2:1 clays (e.g. Illites, Smectites) exhibited less affinity towards Pb and Cu. However, Kaolinite had better affinity towards Cd ions (approximately 3 times) than both Tully fine and Tully coarse soils. In terms of adsorption of Zn, both Tully soils adsorbed more than Kaolinite. Generally, it was concluded that the presence of reactive clay minerals plays a significant role in adsorption of Pb and Cu.After the understanding of the role of cellulose materials as well as soil sediments in studied heavy metal adsorption, PFT tests were conducted to see the role of cellulose materials in dewatering performance. A 15% solid concentration contaminated slurry was prepared by mixing soil, cellulose materials (2% weight of solids) and heavy metal solution (1000 ppm Pb+500 ppm Cu+500 ppm Cd+500 ppm Zn). It was observed from the PFT tests that in both sediment slurries, the addition of cellulose materials except kraft pulp significantly increased the dewatering rate irrespective of the contamination. However, profound effect of jute fibers and peanut hull on increasing dewatering rate was observed in case of contaminated slurries. A reduction in turbidity of more than 80% was observed with the addition of jute fibers. Peanut and kraft pulp were successful in reducing the turbidity of the filtrate by 78 and 69% respectively. Addition of peanut hulls and jute on contaminated Tully coarse increased the solid content by approximately 33% and 46% respectively. However, in case of contaminated Tully fines a minor increase of 12% was achieved with the addition of jute. The addition of kraft pulp had no significant effect in the solids content. The filtrates collected from dewatering of contaminated Tully fines showed that approximately 98-99% of Cu and Pb was retained, whereas, in Tully coarse slurries 89% Cu and 96% Pb were retained. Although not very high adsorption, both Tully soils were able to retain more than 75% Cd and Zn."
etd_651,Contributions On Theory And Practice For Multi-Mission Wireless Systems,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"The field of wireless systems has long been an active research area with various applications. Recently much attention has been given to multi-mission wireless systems that combine capabilities including information sensing, data processing, energy harvesting as well as the traditional data communication. This dissertation describes our endeavor in addressing some of the research challenges in multi-mission wireless systems, including the development of fundamental limits of such multi-mission wireless systems and effective technologies for improved performance.The first challenge addressed in this dissertation is how to handle interference, which is encountered in almost all wireless systems involving multiple nodes, an attribute shared by most multi-mission systems. To deepen our understanding on the impact of interference, we study a class of Gaussian interference channels (GICs) with mixed interference. A simple coding scheme is proposed based on Sato's non-naive frequency division. The achievable region is shown to be equivalent to that of Costa's noiseberg region for the one-sided Gaussian interference channel. This allows for an indirect proof that this simple achievable rate region is indeed equivalent to the Han-Kobayashi (HK) region with Gaussian input and with time sharing for this class of Gaussian interference channels with mixed interference.Optimal power management strategies are then investigated for a remote estimation system with an energy harvesting sensor. We first establish the asymptotic optimality of uncoded transmission for such a system under Gaussian assumption. With the aim of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) at the receiver, optimal power allocation policies are proposed under various assumptions with regard to the knowledge at the transmitter and the receiver as well as battery storage capacity. For the case where non-causal side information (SI) of future harvested energy is available and battery storage is unlimited, it is shown that the optimal power allocation amounts to a simple 'staircase-climbing' procedure, where the power level follows a non-decreasing staircase function. For the case where battery storage has a finite capacity, the optimal power allocation policy can also be obtained via standard convex optimization techniques. Dynamic programming is used to optimize the allocation policy when causal SI is available. The issue of unknown transmit power at the receiver is also addressed. Finally, to make the proposed solutions practically more meaningful, two heuristic schemes are proposed to reduce computational complexity.Related to the above remote sensing problem, we provide an information theoretic formulation of a multi-functioning radio where communication between nodes involves transmission of both messages and source sequences. The objective is to study the optimal coding trade-off between the rate for message transmission and the distortion for source sequence estimation. For point-to-point systems, it is optimal to simply split total capacity into two components, one for message transmission and one for source transmission. For the multi-user case, we show that such separation-based scheme leads to a strictly suboptimal rate-distortion trade-off by examining the simple problem of sending a common source sequence and two independent messages through a Gaussian broadcast channel.Finally we study the design of a practical multi-mission wireless system - the dual-use of airborne radio frequency (RF) systems. Specifically, airborne multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems are leveraged for the detection of moving targets in a typical airborne environment that is characterized by the lack of scatterers. With uniform linear arrays (ULAs), angular domain decomposition of channel matrices is utilized and target detection can be accomplished by detection of change in the resolvable paths in the angular domain. For both linear and nonlinear arrays, Doppler frequency analysis can also be applied and the change in frequency components indicates the presence of potential airborne targets. Nonparametric detection of distribution changes is utilized in both approaches."
etd_260,Control of Inflammation Using Drug Delivery Strategies in in vitro Models,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Cellular signaling, Decoy oligonucleotide, Drug delivery, Polysialic acid","Regulation of inflammation is a crucial component of the immune system in response to injury and infection. In otherwise healthy individuals, an initial acute inflammatory response will subside once the injury or infection is eradicated. However, in certain disease states including autoimmune disease and persistent infection, miscommunication between cells of the immune system leads to a chronic inflammatory response, contributing to disease pathology and exacerbating symptoms. A major regulator of inflammation communication at the cellular level is transcription factor (TF) NF-?B. Under normal conditions, NF-?B is bound to an inhibitor in the cytoplasm. In a chronic disease state, NF-?B is overactive and found in the unbound form, resulting in increased production of inflammatory signals.Transcription factor decoys (TFD) are small nucleic acid sequences (~20 base pairs) that mimic the binding site for the TF on the native DNA, but do not encode for any proteins. By binding to the TF in the cytoplasm, TFD have potential to limit excessive immune signaling and inflammatory protein production. Unfortunately, clinical success of TFD has been hampered by a lack of an effective delivery method. Lack of stability and ease of degradation of the TFD require a protective carrier for delivery; however many synthetic carrier systems induce toxicity or an enhanced inflammatory response. In disease states characterized by excessive inflammation, treatment-induced toxicity or immune response is highly undesirable.The Bader lab has previously reported a nanoparticle carrier system based on natural polysaccharides, designed specifically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The materials used in this system have properties that can be exploited for the additional application of DNA delivery. This thesis will detail the adaptation of polysialic acid-N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles to be used as delivery vehicles for an NF-?B TFD treatment in in vitro models of rheumatoid arthritis and cystic fibrosis."
bce_etd_68,Controlling Bacterial Persister Cells and Biofilms by Synthetic Brominated Furanones,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"antibiotic tolerance, biofilm, brominated furanones, persister, quorum sensing","Bacteria are well known to obtain tolerance to antibiotics by forming multicellular structures, known as biofilms, and by entering dormancy and forming persister cells. Both mechanisms allow bacteria to tolerate antibiotics at concentrations hundreds to thousands of times higher than the lethal dose for regular planktonic cells of the same genotype. Persister formation increases in biofilms; thus, effective control of persister cells, especially those in biofilms is critically important to infection control. Over the past decades, a bacterial signaling system based on cell density, named quorum sensing (QS), has been found to regulate biofilm formation and, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the level of persistence.In this study, we characterized the effects of synthetic brominated furanones, a group of QS inhibitors, on the persistence of P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Our results revealed that (Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (BF8) can reduce persister formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. coli RP437 and restore the antibiotic susceptibility of isolated persister cells at growth non-inhibitory concentrations. In addition to planktonic persister cells, BF8 was also found to reduce persister formation in the biofilms of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. coli RP437.Study at the genetic level using DNA microarrays demonstrated that BF8 induced the gene mdaB in both strains and 7 genes encoding oxidoreductases in P. aeruginosa. In E. coli RP437 persister cells, BF8 was also found to repress the genes for synthesizing indole, a signaling molecule reported to induce persister formation in E. coli. Interestingly, although BF8 is a QS inhibitor, the QS signal 3-oxo-C12- acyl homoserine-lactone also rendered the persister cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its mucoid mutant PDO300 more sensitive to antibiotics. Furthermore, BF8 was found to have cidal effects on PDO300.Besides BF8, some other BFs were also found to restore the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells to ciprofloxacin. Collectively, these results indicate that this group of QS inhibitors has promising activities to control multidrug tolerant persister cells; and there might be other bacterial targets of BFs in addition to QS inhibition."
etd_377,CONTROLLING BIOFILM AND PERSISTER CELLS BY TARGETING CELL MEMBRANES,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptides, biofilm, Escherichia coli, persister cells, Pseudomonas aeruginosa","The rapid increase in antibiotic resistant infections and the slowing pace of antibiotic development emphasize the need for alternative therapeutic agents to cure infectious diseases especially those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Bacteria obtain resistance to antibiotics through multiple mechanisms. One of intrinsic mechanisms of drug resistance is persister formation, by which bacterial cells enter a metabolically inactive stage and become highly tolerant to essentially all antibiotics, even at the concentrations that are hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose required to kill normal planktonic cells of the same strain. Persister cells in biofilms are even more difficult to kill due to the presence of an extracellular matrix that can block or retard the penetration of antibiotics. Thus new antimicrobials that are effective against these drug tolerant cells are urgently needed for infection control.In this study, we characterized the antimicrobial activities of newly designed synthetic peptides on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains including regular planktonic cells and those in biofilms and at the persister stages. Our results revealed that 2D-24, an RW-rich dendrimeric peptide, can kill planktonic cells of both P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PDO300 (a mucoid strain) in a dose-dependent manner. Killing effect on biofilm and persister cells was observed at the concentrations without significant toxicity to IB3-1 cells originated from human lung tissues.We also demonstrated that TN-5, a 1,3,5-triazine derivative, has antimicrobial effects on E. coli RP437, P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PDO300 cells, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.8 µM, and kills regular planktonic cells of both species dose dependently. TN-5 was also found effective against persister and biofilm cells of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa; and the killing of biofilm cells of the mucoid PDO300 was enhanced by alginate lyase.To understand the effects of AMP charge on the killing effects, we modified the net charge of calcitermin originated from human airway secretions, and tested the effects on E. coli and P. aeruginosa planktonic and persister cells at different pH values. The neutral derivative of calcitermin showed better killing effect on persister cells at pH 7.4.Along with synthetic peptides, we also studied the membrane potential of persister cells with cell sorting and flow cytometry techniques using potentiometric dyes. Persister cells showed lower membrane potential along with lower efflux pump activities compared to normal cells. Based on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that persister cells can be effectively killed by antibiotics that are substrates of efflux pumps. Consistent with this hypothesis, erythromycin was found effective in killing persister cells of E. coli  while normal cells are resistant to it. This higher killing activity of erythromycin was corroborated with higher erythromycin accumulation in persister cells based on the results of Mass Spectrometry analysis."
etd_317,Controlling Microbial Multicellular Behaviors With Saccharide Derivatives,Chemistry,"BIOFILM INHIBITION, CHEMICAL BIOLOGY, MULTICELLULAR BEHAVIORS, PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA, SWARMING","Microbial multicellular behaviors like biofilm formation and swarming motility are known to increase their tolerance against antimicrobials. From microbial standpoint, nonmicrobicidal agents that do not impede growth are tolerable and therefore, there is a lower propensity to develop resistance against such agents as compared to microbicidal ones (antibiotics). This study describes a new antibiofilm approach of using nonmicrobicidal saccharide derivatives for controlling the multicellular behaviors of gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungus, Candida albicans.Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to secrete rhamnolipids, a class of biosurfactants that plays an important role in maintaining the architecture of its biofilm and promoting its swarming motility. Here we show the ability of certain synthetic nonmicrobicidal disaccharide derivatives (DSDs) to mimic the biofunctions of rhamnolipids. The rhlA mutant of P. aeruginosa is incapable of synthesizing rhamnolipids and also unable to swarm on semi-solid agar gel. When the natural ligands, rhamnolipids were externally added into the semi-solid agar gel in a concentration dependent manner, the swarming of the rhlA mutant reactivated at lower concentrations (10 ?M) and then at relatively higher concentrations (15 ?M), the swarming reactivation was reversed. When some active synthetic DSDs were tested on the rhlA mutant, the bacterial swarming first reactivated and then the activation reversed at higher DSD concentrations, similar to the effect of externally added rhamnolipids. Previously, a known bacterial signalling molecule has been shown to exhibit a similar concentration dependent activation and then activation reversal for light simulation by Vibrio fischeri. Some DSDs having disaccharide stereochemistries (cellobiose or maltose) and a bulky aliphatic tail (3, 7, 11-trimethyl-dodecanyl) caused swarming reactivation of the rhlA mutant at concentrations lower than that caused by the externally added rhamnolipids.The synthetic nonmicrobicidal DSDs were also very effective at inhibiting the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to polystyrene surface, and at inhibiting the bacterial biofilm formation. These DSDs were also potent dispersers of pre-formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. The potent antibiofilm (inhibition and dispersion) activities were observed for those DSDs that possessed a disaccharide (cellobiose or maltose) stereochemistry and a bulky aliphatic chain such as 3, 7, 11-trimethyl-dodecanyl. These potent DSDs had half-maximal inhibitory concentrations for biofilm inhibition (IC50) and dispersion (DC50) comparable to those of known potent antibiofilm agents against P. aeruginosa. Gene-reporting assays indicate that the mechanism of action of such DSDs is not via the known las or rhl quorum sensing systems of P. aeruginosa but that the adhesin potein, pilin maybe a likely target of such molecules.Biofilms formed under natural settings are usually formed by both bacteria and fungus that co-reside in the same microenvironment. Therefore, agents that can prevent mixed biofilms are desirable from a therapeutic standpoint. Despite being nonmicrobicidal to both fungal blastospores and hyphae, the synthetic DSDs were able to inhibit the biofilm formation of fungus Candida albicans. Microscopic evaluation showed that most DSDs did not prevent the blastospores-to-hyphae morphogenesis. The DSDs were effective at inhibiting biofilm formation of Candida albicans when applied within five minutes of seeding the test surface with fungal cells. Using a surface based assay it was shown that one DSD dramatically reduced the surface adhesion of Candida albicans hyphae. The antibiofilm activity of such DSDs against Candida albicans is probably due to their ability to prevent hyphae surface adhesion."
etd_309,Controlling Pseudomonas aeruginosa Persister Cells by Human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Antibiotic tolerance, Flagella, GM-CSF, Persister cells, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pyocins","Bacteria are well known to cause chronic infections in humans by entering dormancy and by developing biofilms. These mechanisms allow bacteria to exhibit antibiotic tolerance and relapse to an active virulent state when the antibiotic treatments are discontinued. During bacterial invasions, the host immune cells secrete special signaling proteins, known as cytokines which orchestrate events leading to human immune response and elimination of bacterial pathogens. However, compared to the well documented activitiesof cytokines in immune reaction, little is known about the direct effects of cytokines on bacterial cells.In this study, we focused on granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine produced by macrophages, T-cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. We chose Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model bacterium. It is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium and a major cause of nosocomial infections in individuals with compromised immune systems and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We show for the first time that GM-CSF can sensitize the persister cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin. The mucoid variant, P. aeruginosa PDO300 was also sensitized by GM-CSF to tobramycin in the presence of alginate lyase. In addition, GM-CSF sensitized the biofilm cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PDO300 to tobramycin in presence of biofilm matrix degrading enzymes DNase I and alginate lyase, respectively. In comparison, the normal cells of P. aeruginosa and the non-pathogenic Escherichia coli K12 persister cellswere not affected by GM-CSF.DNA microarray and qPCR analyses revealed that GM-CSF induced flagella and pyocin associated genes in persister cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1, while the same genes in normal cells did not show significant change. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and cross-linking, GM-CSF was found to interact with the protein FliC (flagellin). Deletion of fliC gene abolished the effects of GM-CSF on P. aeruginosa persister cells, which was restored by complementation of the fliC gene. Overall, the findings from thisstudy suggest that cytokines have a direct interaction with bacterial cells and disturb their persistence. The results are helpful for understanding bacterial physiology and for developing new persistence control methods."

Such mechanisms lead to hundreds to thousands times higher tolerance to antimicrobials. With the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and lack of new antibiotics, developing alternative therapies to combat antibiotic resistant pathogens have become an urgency in modern medicine.In this study, we aimed to develop a new inhibitory strategy for persister control using chitosan based N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) – polysialic acid (PSA) nanoparticles. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as a model species. TMC-PSA nanoparticles (NPs) were found to effectively reduce the persistence level of P. aeruginosa PAO1 both in planktonic populations and in biofilms.(Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-methylfuran- 2(5H)-one (BF8) is a synthetic brominated furanone with strong activities against bacterial quorum sensing. It can reduce persister formation during bacterial growth (including that in biofilm), and sensitize isolated persisters to antibiotics. To further develop BF8 based control methods, we encapsulated BF8 into TMC-PSA nanoparticles, evaluated BF8 release and tested inhibitory effects of BF8 encapsulated nanoparticles (BFNPs) on bacterial persistence. The inhibitory effects of both NPs and BFNPs on P. aeruginosa PAO1 persistence were found to increase with the concentration of NPs, and the inhibitory activities of NPs and BFNPs were found to increase as pH decreased. Collectively, TMC-PSA nanoparticles exhibited potent inhibition of P. aeruginosa PAO1 persistence and are potential drug carrier system for BF8."
etd_658,CONVENIENT ETHERIFICATION USING TRICHLOROACETIMIDATES AND SYNTHESIS OF AMINOSTEROID SHIP INHIBITORS,Chemistry,,"Alcohols are a common form of functionality in organic chemistry, and are often present in biologically active molecules.  The protection of hydroxy groups is crucial in long multi-step synthetic routes, as the unprotected alcohol is typically not compatible with many reagents.  Alcohols are often protected as corresponding benzyl ether, which can then be removed when desired to reveal the alcohol functional group. Classic methodology for protection of alcohols as benzyl ethers requires harsh conditions utilizing strong acids and bases, which functions well for simple substrates. In more complex multifunctional molecules this can lead to degradation and side products.  Therefore, there is a need for the development of milder conditions for the protection of alcohols.Recently a number of reagents have been developed to form benzyl ethers under mild, neutral conditions that and do not disturb the sensitive functionality in complex molecules.  Many of these reagents have been based on imidate-type systems. The most common imidate system, the trichloroacetimidate, is often utilized for the installation of ethers under Lewis acid catalyzed conditions.  Given their ready availability, a reevaluation of the reactivity of alcohols and trichloroacetimidates has been undertaken.  In many cases, simply heating the imidate with an alcohol in refluxing toluene without an exogenous acid or base is an effective method for the formation of the desired ether. This operationally simple procedure is most effective for trichloroacetimidates that are precursors to highly stabilized cations (i.e. the 4-methoxybenzyl and diphenylmethyl group). The use of this new procedure with a number of acid and base sensitive substrates, which are protected in excellent yield without disturbing the delicate functionality present in these molecules, is presented.Cancer is a group of disorders that are all defined by abnormal cell growth in an organism.  This is a very broad set of diseases that can affect multiple organs.  While classic cancer treatments have focused on killing all cells that divide quickly, more modern treatments attempt to selectively stop cancer progression by influencing cell signaling pathways. There are many studies about how cancer cells coopt cell signaling pathways and use these systems, which control cell growth in normal cells, to facilitate their own uncontrolled progression.  One of the major cell signaling pathways implicated in tumor development is the PI3K pathway, which is governed by the kinase PI3K and the phosphatases PTEN and SHIP.SHIP1 is an SH2-containing inositol 5’-phosphatase found in blood cells that is responsible for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.  This enzyme is part of a major cellular signaling pathway (the PI3K pathway) that controls many important cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation and adhesion.  SHIP1 inhibition has been found to increase blood cell production and slow the growth of blood cancer cells. Certain aminosteroids show selectivity as SHIP1 inhibitors and therefore may have therapeutic applications.  In this study, syntheses of a number of aminosteroid derivatives were performed and these compounds are evaluated for their potential as SHIP1 inhibitors."

One type of bifunctional chelator is the single amino acid chelates (SAACs), which can be effectively coordinated to the {Re(CO)3}+ core through the chelating terminus.  The other terminus can be used to fuse the SAAC into a variety of different peptides or biomolecules.  Based on these strategies, syntheses of various SAAC ligands were investigated.

Additionally, fluorescence and UV-Vis studies were done on Re(I)-SAAC compounds sent from collaborators."
etd_200,Coordination polymers of the alkaline earth metals for applications in synthesis and gas storage,Chemistry,,"The work presented in this thesis outlines our efforts to synthesize alkaline earth metalcoordination complexes that could potentially serve as gas storage and synthetic precursormaterials. The properties of these complexes are heavily influenced by factors such as thepropensity to aggregate and the absence of energetically available d-orbitals which providedirectionality. These often pose a challenge in obtaining suitable, stable compounds.Some challenges in the crystallization of alkaline earth coordination complexes involvethe precipitation of insoluble aggregates. Thus, a great part of the work focused on studyingsuitable reaction conditions towards the formation of X-ray quality crystals for structuralelucidation. Slow concentration and hydro/solvothermal techniques, among others, were primecrystallization methods in this work.The bulk of this thesis is divided in two parts. The first part details our attempts tosynthesize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba. Our ligands of choice werethe p, m, o-pyridinecarboxylic acids which provide two different binding sites. These consist ofan N-donor and an anionic carboxylic acid, the N-donor located at different positions in thepyridyl ring depending on the isomer. These are also of low cost and soluble in different organicsolvents.The use of pyridinecarboxylic acids resulted in the systematic isolation of fivemagnesium coordination complexes, three of which exhibit open-framework character andremain stable after removal of guests, and two of which are hydrogen bonded networks. Further,systematic work with the heavier metals resulted in three fully 3-dimensional complexes basedon Ca, Sr and Ba and one hydrogen-bonded Ca complex. A pattern is observed when using thelinear p or angular m-pyridinecarboxylic acid in the presence of MeOH/DMF mixtures, in which3-dimensional motifs with open-framework (p) and dense (m) character (Mg, Ca and Sr) aredisplayed. The dimensionality decreases in the presence of water or strongly coordinatingdonors, leading to the formation of hydrogen bound or 2-dimensional complexes.The second part of this thesis involves the isolation of crown stabilized alkaline earthtosylates. The work resulted in the isolation of four new crown stabilized alkaline earth tosylates.Trends observed include an increase in coordination number as the size of the metal increases.Variation of crown:metal stoichiometry was also studied and resulted in two different calciumspecies displaying fully separated (1:1) and contact separated (1:2) ion association modes. For Srand Ba, (1:1) stoichiometries resulted in hydrogen bound contact species.This thesis provides a selection of alkaline earth metal coordination complexes. Thepreparation of these complexes has led to the elucidation of their synthetic routes. Fullcharacterization of the complexes is also provided."
psy_etd_180,Coping with College Stress: Does Sense of Coherence Influence the Use of Alcohol and OTC Medication?,Psychology,"Alcohol, Over the Counter medication, Sense of Coherence, SOC","The combination of stress and psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) have been associated with alcohol consumption and the nonindicated use of over the counter (OTC) medications. However, some people have personal resources that contribute to a successful management of the stress response. Antonovsky's (1987) salutogenic theory proposes that a person's sense of coherence (SOC) buffers the relationship between stress appraisal and stressor-induced reactions. This study examined the SOC in relation to associations of stress-related indices with substance-related coping behaviors. One hundred and sixty-five college student participants completed questionnaires that assessed their demographics, stressors, perceived stress, SOC, psychological/physical symptoms, as well as their past thirty-day use of alcohol and OTC cold/pain medications. Path analyses of these data yielded some reasonably fitting models, with mixed support for study hypotheses. Results from these analyses showed that college students may consume alcohol for reasons unrelated to the reported stress experience. Results also showed that students use OTC cold and pain medications in response to stressors and psychological symptoms. Although there is limited evidence for gender differences among the variables in this study, findings showed that when experiencing stress, males tended to consume more alcohol and OTC medications relative to females. The clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed."

Qualitative content analysis research method was applied with references made to secondary research drawn from books, articles and electronic databases.The purpose of this thesis was to systematically analyze corporate social responsibility (CSR) content featured in the annual reports of 14 leading Southern African companies for the 2013 financial year. The objective of the study was to investigate how Southern African companies report on corporate social responsibility initiatives. The following research questions were addressed:Research Question 1: How are CSR reporting trends manifested in Annual Reports?Research Question 2: What is the scope of CSR activities demonstrated?Research Question 3: Is there a clear mandate for undertaking CSR strategies?The following trends were identified: commitment to the community, corporate pledge to society, scope of activities, employees living the values and declaration of CSR spending. The study found that the scope of CSR activities demonstrated seems to support sustainable development as an overarching concept for engaging in CSR. Lastly, companies did display a clear mandate for carrying out CSR initiatives."
etd_239,"COSTS AND BENEFITS OF EMPLOYEE INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC: EXTENDING THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE TYPOLOGY, CONSEQUENCES, PROCESSES, AND CONTINGENCIES",Business Administration,"Customer service, Job performance, Multilevel analysis, Personality, Scale development and validation, Work stress","Two areas of research approach employee interactions with the public in different ways; research on emotional labor and burnout describes it as solely harmful, while research on job design considers its merits. I propose that each area of the literature adopts a narrow perspective that creates these different views. This dissertation constructs and validates a framework based on valence (negative and positive) and content (affect-based and task-based) dimensions that identify four types of employee experiences with the public: mistreatment, gratitude, problematic demands, and cooperation. Then, I use these measures to predict employee well-being (i.e., emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction) and performance (i.e., prescribed task performance, proactive customer service, and incivility toward customers), the mechanisms that underlie these outcomes, and the boundary conditions. Based on multilevel analyses of 403 service employee-supervisor dyads from various organizations in Thailand, I found that both negative and positive interactions with the public contribute to employee well-being and performance. Moreover, I found that negative experiences with the public do not always cause deleterious effects on employees (e.g., poor proactive customer service and incivility toward customers). This paper systematically explores the patterns, mediating processes, and boundary conditions of the relationships between different types of interactions with the public and key work-related outcomes. These findings offer important implications for research and practice in the area of customer service performance."
etd_412,Coteaching in Secondary Schools,Teaching and Leadership,"collaboration, coteaching, pedagogical content knowledge","The use of coteaching as a means of supporting students with disabilities in the general education classroom is becoming more common. The literature base on the effectiveness of coteaching in elementary grade levels is well established; however, coteaching in secondary school is a less documented topic. Therefore, this study examines coteaching in secondary schools. Coteaching, as defined in this study, is one general and one special education teacher sharing instructional responsibilities for at least one group of students in one classroom for at least one instructional period. The research questions guiding the study focused on the models of coteaching used at the secondary level, coteachers’ understanding of coteaching, reported challenges in sustaining coteaching, and the matters that influence coteaching practices.For this study, qualitative research methods were used to collect data on coteaching practices in two suburban school districts. There were 13 participants in this study comprising seven coteaching pairs; one special educator was a member in two participant pairs. The grade levels represented by the participants were seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth; the content areas represented were English, French, mathematics, science, and social studies. Data was gathered during two school years (May 2011 to March 2012) through two in-depth interviews and one observation of the participant pairs coteaching. Each coteacher participated in one individual semi-structured interview. Six of the seven participant pairs also participated in one semi-structured interview with their coteaching partner; one participant pair was not able to complete the joint interview because of scheduling difficulties. Each coteaching pair was observed for one instructional period. The interviews and observations yielded data on the coteaching practices of the participants.Significant findings of the study include a deeper understanding of the complexities of coteaching at the secondary level. The six models of coteaching (one teach – one assist, station teaching, parallel teaching, alternative teaching, teaming, and one teach – one observe), are a useful framework for coteachers. The use of one particular coteaching model over another one seems to be influenced by the open communication and the level of trust between the partners. Likewise, open communication may lead to a richer understanding of coteaching for each partner and development of shared pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Shared PCK, a new conceptualization of teacher knowledge based on the collaborative work of coteachers, is an amalgam of knowledge of content, knowledge of pedagogy, and knowledge of student learning characteristics. Findings of this study indicate that shared PCK led the participant pairs to engage in more synergistic coteaching practices. In addition to the development of shared PCK, personal principles of teaching, contextual matters, and the role each teacher negotiates while coteaching also influenced coteaching practices. The participants reported that challenges to their coteaching practices included inadequate time to collaborate, connect and co-plan; the demands on the special educators’ time; and the class roster composition.The findings of this study should be considered in light of the limitations of the study. Limitations include the limited amount of interview and observational data on coteaching practices and the lack of data on student achievement in cotaught classes. Implications are offered for further research as well as considerations for teacher education and coteaching practices in secondary schools."

This mixed-qualitative methods study explores what effects convicted criminals report experiencing in the wake of media coverage of their alleged crimes and trials. There are two primary areas of focus in this study: What effects inmates perceive media coverage has had on their cases and how they feel they have been personally affected by media coverage of their alleged crimes and subsequent trials.
che_etd_191,Covalent Modification that Enhances Protein Properties and Functions and Folds Random Coil into Alpha-Helix,Chemistry,Chemistry,"Understanding the fundamental science of aggregation and surface adsorption of proteins is critical for developing protein-based drugs, understanding aggregation-induced diseases and for preventing biofouling that impacts a wide range of industries. In spite of the advances in sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods, the commercialization of protein drugs has been impeded by poor solubility, inevitable aggregation, and difficulty in purification. The primary aim of this dissertation is to modify proteins covalently to induce folding in random coil sequences, prevent aggregation, surface adsorption and for increasing the thermal stability against aggregation of proteins.The first chapter describes the chemistry for modifying the lysine residues in proteins with alditols (organic kosmotropes), via an amide bond using the traditional N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated carboxylic acids or via an efficient water-driven ligation generating a squaramide linkage. Conjugating such organic kosmotropes to proteins via a squaramide linkage, results in the formation of a hydrolytically stable bond together with higher amount of modification when compared to amide bond formation using N-activated carboxylic acids.The second chapter presents a general approach for preventing both protein aggregation and surface adsorption by modifying proteins with beta-cyclodextrins (betaCD) via a squaramide linkage. As compared to native unmodified proteins, the beta-cyclodextrin-modified proteins (lysozyme and RNase A) exhibited significant reduction in aggregation, surface adsorption and increase in thermal stability against aggregation.The third chapter describes the covalent modification of a random coil mutant (L44A) of the coiled coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMPcc) with squarate derivatives. The covalent modification with betaCD-amino squarates or methyl squarate alone folded the random coil into an a-helix. The COMPcc is capable of binding small molecule such ascurcumin, retinol and vitamin D. Curcumin exhibited an increase in the fluorescence signal upon binding to L44A(betaCD)n as compared to the wild type protein suggesting that the folding stability of L44A is either enhanced or preserved.The fourth chapter describes the synthesis and development of an adamantane-platinum conjugate (analog of carboplatin) hosted in beta-cyclodextrin. This inclusion complex formed by betaCD and the adamantane-platinum conjugate exhibited higher cytotoxicity towards neurobalstoma (SK-N-SH) cells than carboplatin. This approach provides versatility for enhancing drug properties via structural modification and targeted delivery using protein&ndashdrug; conjugates"
etd_435,Crack Growth Mechanisms under Anti-Plane Shear in Composite Laminates,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"anti-plane shear, delamination, fracture, mode III, polymer matrix composite","The research conducted for this dissertation focuses on determining the mechanisms associated with crack growth in polymer matrix composite laminates subjected to anti-plane shear (mode III) loading. For mode III split-beam test methods were proposed, and initial evaluations were conducted. A single test method was selected for further evaluation. Using this test method, it was determined that the apparent mode III delamination toughness, GIIIc, depended on geometry, which indicated a true material property was not being measured. Transverse sectioning and optical microscopy revealed an array of transverse matrix cracks, or echelon cracks, oriented at approximately 45° and intersecting the plane of the delamination. Subsequent investigations found the echelon array formed prior to the onset of planar delamination advance and that growth of the planar delamination is always coupled to echelon array formation in these specimens. The evolution of the fracture surfaces formed by the echelon array and planar delamination were studied, and it was found that the development was similar to crack growth in homogenous materials subjected to mode III or mixed mode I-III loading, although the composite laminate architecture constrained the fracture surface development differently than homogenous materials.  It was also found that, for split-beam specimens such as those used herein, applying an anti-plane shear load results in twisting of the specimen’s uncracked region which gives rise to a mixed-mode I-III load condition. This twisting has been related to the apparent mode III toughness as well as the orientation of the transverse matrix cracks. A finite element model was then developed to study the mechanisms of initial echelon array formation. From this, it is shown that an echelon array will develop, but will become self-limiting prior to the onset of planar delamination growth."

To do so, this study examines five moments in Clinton’s career in which she actively employs rhetoric that affects the public’s perception of Clinton as a trustworthy or untrustworthy figure. The five case studies analyzed in this study are Bill and Hillary Clinton’s 1992 interview on 60 Minutes, following accusations of Bill’s extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers; Hillary Clinton’s tears in New Hampshire on the 2008 presidential campaign trail; Hillary’s “3am Phone Call” ad, released during the 2008 primary campaign; Hillary’s social media efforts to brand herself as a grandmother during the 2016 presidential campaign; and Hillary’s infamous email scandal that unfolded during the 2016 presidential campaign. With the theoretical foundation of Walter Fisher’s narrative theory, Michael McGee’s ideograph, Kenneth Burke’s identification theory, and Shawn Parry-Giles’ work in gender authenticity, this study concludes with a discussion of Clinton’s most frequently and successfully- deployed rhetorical strategies for building trust with the American people."
etd_313,"Creating the American Teenager:  Experts, Authority, and Youth in the Cold War",History,"Childhood, Education Reform, Home Economics, Life Adjustment Education, Social Sciences","This dissertation examines the way life adjustment education shaped the experiences of reformers, teachers, and students in the public school system during the 1940s and 1950s. Intended by educational theorists to reform curriculum and teach practical life skills in the classroom, this program reflected the socio-cultural tensions in the United States following World War II and exemplifies the way public institutions worked to develop an image of the ideal American teenager: civic-minded, psychologically healthy, and adjusted to society.Adjustment education advocates' emphasis on young people as the key to creating a stable society made youth the central figures of mid-century America. The reformers' actions spoke to their belief in the importance of mental health, a concern which should not be dismissed lightly. Their belief in expert intervention into personal development also suggests a new function for schools, one that intervened in personal life, blending public and private issues. Despite how later educators and scholars dismissed the ideas behind adjustment education, life adjustment advocates concern with mental health indicated an early interest in an education system that might benefit all students.  Life adjustment educators wanted to use psychology to improve American life; however, in the end it was not enough to solve the divisions of race, gender, and class that existed in society."

Many healthcare professionals struggle to communicate with Deaf individuals because they have little awareness of how to interact with these patients in culturally sensitive ways. This study sought to understand the perspectives and experiences of hearing border-crossers -- hearing people who cross ""borders,"" figuratively, to interact and communicate with Deaf people. Hearing border crossers hold useful knowledge that will shed light in facilitating communication between Deaf patients and hearing healthcare professionals. Using symbolic interactionism as the epistemological framework, qualitative interviews were conducted with three clusters of hearing border crossers--those with deaf family members, those who work professionally with deaf people, and those who interact with deaf people in everyday community settings. Direct observations of hearing-Deaf interactions at public spaces offered further insight into hearing border-crossers' experiences. Focus group data from Deaf consultants were combined with interview and observational data to include at least a partial Deaf perspective on hearing border crossers' accounts. The analysis examines how hearing border crossers enter Deaf worlds, how they gain competence and negotiate difficulties, and what strategies they offer for successful interactions. The dissertation offers an instructional design planning approach that incorporates community perspectives. Ideas from this study were extended and the analysis generated the elements of a learning environment where hearing and Deaf people might interact and learn to communicate effectively. Implications from the study are developed for healthcare instruction"
etd_246,Crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel Networks Designed as Mechanical Actuators,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"hyaluronic acid, hydrogels, peripheral nerve regeneration, polymeric actuators","Bioengineers are in constant pursuit of solutions to problems facing the medical and pharmaceutical field by designing biomaterials that closely mimic the target natural systems. A unique collection of polymers, known as polymeric actuators, have been devised with the ability to convert an external stimulus to a change in shape, size or permeability. The current options within polymeric biomaterials with multi-functionality include matrices that are biocompatible, biodegradable, quick transitioning / shape changing, and mechanically tunable. These properties have been harnessed for application such as stents, valves, semi permeable membranes, and dynamic cell culture substrates. For such applications quick and uniform actuator response that does not need to be sustained for more than a few hours is desired. However there exist other areas of biomedical applications, such as wound closure/healing and nerve regeneration, where polymeric actuators have been underutilized. These applications however call for a polymer system that can actuate at controlled slow speeds and sustain this actuation for several days. At present there is a lack of such slow actuating polymer system. Each year over 50,000 peripheral nerve repair procedures are performed (National Center for Health Statistics, 1995). The total annual costs in U.S alone exceed $ 7 billion (American Paralysis Association, 1997). The treatment of a nerve transection is dependent on the size of the injury gap. Similarly, the extent of regeneration and re-innervation in the PNS is also governed by the size of the gap. For a smaller gap (<10 mm) the surgeon can pull the severed nerve ends closer and suture them to repair the injury. For larger gaps autologous nerve transplant is the gold standard treatment despite the inherent disadvantages. Over the past decades biomaterial researchers have tested several polymeric nerve conduits as an alternative to autologous nerve grafts. However none have been able to match the success rates of autologous grafts. There is a lack of an effectivebiomaterial solution to the problem of a large gap nerve injury. For many years there has been a hypothesis that nervous tissue can be successfully elongated via application of an external mechanical force alone which could be used to treat peripheral nerve gap injuries. Mechanical actuation studies have been shown to produce successful stretch growth in individual axons and axonal bundles. This phenomenon is at play in nature during embryonic growth and development of the body of organisms to adulthood. Applying tensional forces at appropriate rates (< 100 ?m/hr) causes sustained axonal stretch growth. The solution we propose in this work is a biomaterial that can be programmed to perform the function of a mechanical actuator at rates suitable for axonal stretch growth. We designed, fabricated, and characterized a novel hyaluronic acid based hydrogel that shrinks over time along a pre-defined axis thereby providing the source for tension that could be used for sustained axonal stretch growth. The shear thinning property of hyaluronic acid (HA) enabled us to test if we could store a retractive stress in a rapidly crosslinked network under shear flow and then controllably release this stress and achieve shrinkage of the network scaffold along one desired axis. We investigated two strategies to achieve this goal. The retractive stress trapped in the crosslinked network was released either by manipulating the main backbone HA chains or by selectively breaking the crosslinks. The shrinkage rates obtained were within the range of stretching rates that have successfully stretched neuronal cells. We also confirmed that the material's cytocompatibility was unaffected by the chemical modifications that HA was subjected to. This polymer system is a novel addition to the existing polymeric actuators and is a step towards filling the void of a slow, long term actuating polymer."
psc_etd_111,"Cultivating Reform: Richard Nixon's Illicit Substance Control Legacy, Medical Marijuana Social Movement Organizations, And Venue Shopping",Political Science,"Medical marijuana, Controlled Substance Act of 1970","Over the course of the last two decades, organizations representing the medical marijuana social movement have campaigned for, proposed state level legislation, and supported numerous legal arguments that challenge and attempt to reform U.S. federal illicit substance policies. This set of social regulatory policies, commonly known as the Controlled Substance Act of 1970 (CSA), were drafted, promoted, and implemented by the Nixon Administration then subsequently entrenched by multiple presidents with acquiescent congresses adopting supplemental supply-side resource allocating legislation. My dissertation research uncoils the convoluted history and institutional dynamics of path dependent U.S. illegal drug control policies to answer the question of how social movement organizations (SMOs) challenge and reform executively entrenched policies. First, I examine the Nixon Administration's decision-making process via archival materials in order to understand why and how the CSA was ""framed,"" introduced, and ratified. Second, two presidential illicit substance control case studies (Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush) are presented to demonstrate how U.S. illicit substance control is executively entrenched. Third, periodical challenges prior to the first state-level medical marijuana law are presented as antecedent and instructional to contemporary SMO institutional mobilization. Last, through interviews, media portrayals, and institutional rulings I demonstrate how medical marijuana SMOs have ""reframed"" the drug's definition then ""shopped"" institutional venues for the purpose of reforming existing policies."
etd_723,Cytotoxicity of Galvanically Coupled Magnesium and Titanium Particles for Therapeutic Effect,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Cytotoxicity, Galvanic corrosion, Magnesium and magnesium alloys, Oxidation and reduction reactions, Reactive oxygen species","This dissertation characterized how galvanic coupling of magnesium (Mg) with titanium (Ti) via sputtering enhanced the cytotoxicity of Mg particles due to increased corrosion rate.  Mg and Mg-Ti particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which showed that Mg and Mg-Ti particles have the average diameter of 50 µm, which makes them slightly larger than an average mammalian cell.  Therefore, the cytotoxicity of the particles is not due to the ingestion of the particles by cells via phagocytosis, but solely due to electrochemical effects.  Sputtering of Ti to partially cover Mg particles results in a very thin layer, in the range of nm.  The surface area of Ti covering the Mg particles matters more than the thickness of the Ti layer, as the Ti layer serves as a catalyst for the reduction reactions, spatially separating the oxidation reaction of Mg and the reduction reaction of water/oxygen.The first part of the dissertation focuses on the in vitro cell viability experiments to show that Mg and Mg-Ti particles kill cells in a dosage-dependent manner, where Mg-Ti particles kill cells more effectively than Mg alone.  Cytotoxicity of Mg and Mg-Ti was measured on different types of cells, such as murine pre-osteoblast cells, human osteosarcoma cells, and bacterial Escherichia coli cells.  For murine pre-osteoblast cells, Mg killed cells completely at 1500 µg/ml (less than 1%), while Mg-Ti killed cells completely at 750 µg/ml, which is half of the concentration of Mg.  Doubling and tripling the pre-osteoblast cell density did not increase the particle concentration that required to kill cells completely, but did decrease the rate of cell viability drop over particle concentration.  Mg and Mg-Ti killed pre-osteoblast cells within 18-24 hours, and if many cells were viable, cells proliferated and recovered after 24 hours, while if more than 50% cells died, remaining cells stayed alive but did not proliferate.  Cytotoxicity of Mg and Mg-Ti also depended on proximity, where only cells less than 2 mm away from the cluster of particles were killed.  For osteosarcoma cells, Mg could not kill cells completely even at 2500 µg/ml, while Mg-Ti killed cells completely at 1250 µg/ml by 24 hours.  By 72 hours, Mg killed cells completely at 2500 µg/ml, and Mg-Ti killed cells completely at 1000 µg/ml.  Higher concentrations and longer periods of time were needed to kill osteosarcoma cells, compared to murine pre-osteoblast cells.  Osteosarcoma cells also showed the same trend as pre-osteoblast cells, where at low particle concentrations, the cells were able to proliferate and recover, at medium particle concentrations, the remaining live cells did not proliferate, and at high particle concentrations, the cells died and did not recover.  The remaining live cells and their daughter cells did not gain resistance to the particle treatment as they were killed again without having to increase the particle concentration.  24-hour grown E. coli biofilms and planktonic cells were also treated with high concentrations of particles, and compared to conventional antibiotics, such as ofloxacin, Mg and Mg-Ti were able to kill biofilm more significantly, although not completely (down to 2%).  However, Mg and Mg-Ti showed great promise in killing and preventing biofilms.The second part of the dissertation focuses on investigating whether pH is the main cause of Mg cytotoxicity as many studies have claimed, and if the pH is the major or sole cause of enhanced cytotoxicity of Mg-Ti.  This study showed that the pH levels of Mg and Mg-Ti were the same at the same particle concentration, which does not explain the increased killing of Mg-Ti.  Also, Mg and Mg-Ti did not just kill cells directly, but also affected the components, such as the proteins, in the cell culture medium.Overall, this study provides better understanding of cytotoxicity of Mg and Mg-Ti, so that not only Mg and Mg-Ti can be used to target and kill cancer and bacterial infections for the therapeutic effect, but to show that Mg and Mg-based alloys may not be as biocompatible, which is still the common conception of this biomaterial."
mae_etd_77,Damage Characterization and Analytical Modeling of Quasi-statically Indented Graphite/Epoxy-Honeycomb Core Composite Sandwich Stru,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Mechanical engineering,"The research conducted for this dissertation focused on understanding the nature and extent of barely visible impact damage (BVID) in composite sandwich structures. This was part of a larger research effort that included studies on the influence of BVID on the compressive strengths and failure modes of composite sandwich structures. In this dissertation, the nature and extent of BVID is studied in aluminum honeycomb core sandwich panels with eight and sixteen ply, quasi-isotropic, graphite/epoxy face sheets. The damage in the sandwich structure is created quasi-statically using spherical indentors of two different sizes. Apart from the face sheet thickness and indentor size, other parameters that are varied in the experimental investigations include the core thickness, core density and face sheet layup. The effects of these parameters on the nature and extent of damage in the sandwich structure is evaluated. The different damage metrics of dent diameter, dent depth and planar area of delamination are used for damage characterization and these damage metrics are evaluated non-destructively. The damage resistance of the different sandwich configurations based on these damage metrics is then assessed. It is shown that when the extent of damage in a sandwich structure is determined based on the dent depth or the dent diameter, the sandwich structure that uses a higher density core is the most damage resistant. However, when the extent of damage is based on the planar area of delamination, the parameters that govern the damage size differ for the different face sheet thicknesses. An analytical model is developed in this dissertation to predict the quasi-static load versus displacement response of the sandwich structure during loading, including the onset of damage and the subsequent unloading behavior. It is shown that the analytical model is capable of predicting the residual dent depth and the residual dent diameter of the sandwich structure for damage within the vicinity of BVID"

To investigate this problem, the purpose of this study was to explore how Chinese women audience members produce different meanings in terms of gender identity and gender relations through viewing The Golden Era (2014), directed by a female filmmaker Ann Hui. To deeply understand the viewing experiences of Chinese women audience members, this qualitative research project was designed as a reception analysis. To gather data, interviews with 18 Chinese women with viewing experiences of this film were collected from December 2014 to January 2015. The transcribed interviews were translated and analyzed. Under the framework of feminist cultural studies, the portrayal of gender roles and gender relations in this film incited various reactions and reading practices of Chinese audience members throughout these data. Through feminist standpoint theory, these findings were useful for subtly recognizing how Chinese women's multiple reading practices problematize and complicate the oppressor/oppressed binary of the power relations in terms of gender."
etd_531,Data Driven Nonparametric Detection,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Date driven, Detection, Nonparametric","The major goal of signal detection is to distinguish between hypotheses about the state of events based on observations. Typically, signal detection can be categorized into centralized detection, where all observed data are available for making decision, and decentralized detection, where only quantized data from distributed sensors are forwarded to a fusion center for decision making. While these problems have been intensively studied under parametric and semi-parametric models with underlying distributions being fully or partially known, nonparametric scenarios are not well understood yet. This thesis mainly explores nonparametric models with unknown underlying distributions as well as semi-parametric models as an intermediate step to solve nonparametric problems.One major topic of this thesis is on nonparametric decentralized detection, in which the joint distribution of the state of an event and sensor observations are not known, but only some training data are available. The kernel-based nonparametric approach has been proposed by Nguyen, Wainwright and Jordan where sensors' quality is treated equally. We study heterogeneous sensor networks, and propose a weighted kernel so that weight parameters are utilized to selectively incorporate sensors' information into the fusion center's decision rule based on quality of sensors' observations. Furthermore, weight parameters also serve as sensor selection parameters with nonzero parameters corresponding to sensors being selected. Sensor selection is jointly performed with decision rules of sensors and the fusion center with the resulting optimal decision rule having only a sparse number of nonzero weight parameters. A gradient projection algorithm and a Gauss-Seidel algorithm are developed to solve the risk minimization problem, which is non-convex, and both algorithms are shown to converge to critical points.The other major topic of this thesis is composite outlier detection in centralized scenarios. The goal is to detect the existence of data streams drawn from outlying distributions among data streams drawn from a typical distribution. We study both the semi-parametric model with known typical distribution and unknown outlying distributions, and the nonparametric model with unknown typical and outlying distributions. For both models, we construct generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRT), and show that with the knowledge of the KL divergence between the outlier and typical distributions, GLRT is exponentially consistent (i.e, the error risk function decays exponentially fast). We also show that with the knowledge of the Chernoff distance between the outlying and typical distributions, GLRT for semi-parametric model achieves the same risk decay exponent as the parametric model, and GLRT for nonparametric model achieves the same performance when the number of data streams gets asymptotically large. We further show that for both models without any knowledge about the distance between distributions, there does not exist an exponentially consistent test. However, GLRT with a diminishing threshold can still be consistent."

Using Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress and coping as a theoretical framework, as well as a coding scheme, a content analysis of 568 posts to online support groups for caregiver-spouses/partners, patients, and caregivers was conducted. The differences between the independent variables poster status (i.e., caregiver-spouse/partner, patient, caregiver), poster gender, post length, group participation level, and emoticons and the dependent variables emotion- and problem-focused coping style, coping category, and coping strategies were explored. Analyses for all posts and at the poster group level revealed that posts from caregiver-spouses/partners and caregivers contained more emotion-focused coping than patient posts. Gender, post length, group participation level, and presence of emoticons revealed varied results."
etd_364,Deciphering the Neuroprotective Potential of Interleukin-1? (IL-1?) using in vitro Murine Models of Oxidative Stress,Biology,"Glutathione, Interleukin-1 ?, Neuroprotection, Oxidative stress","Interleukin-1? (IL-1?), a key cytokine driving neuroinflammation in the Central Nervous System (CNS), is enhanced in many neurological diseases/disorders, including but not limited to ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The dominant view is that IL-1? contributes to and/or sustains pathophysiological processes. However, other studies demonstrate that IL-1? can play an important role in neural protection and repair. It may do so by modifying astrocyte behavior. Indeed, studies from our laboratory demonstrate that IL-1? increases the synthesis and release of the antioxidant molecule glutathione (GSH) from astrocytes and that IL-1?-treated astrocytes show increased resistance to oxidative stress [He, Jackman et al. 2015], a pathological process that leads to neural damage in the above-mentioned maladies. Given this, the overall goal of this thesis was to study the protective potential of IL-1? against oxidant injury in astrocytes, neurons and astrocyte and neurons in co-culture.We confirmed that IL-1? mediates an increase in extracellular GSH levels in cortical wild-type astrocytic (as shown by our laboratory earlier [He, Jackman et al. 2015]) and mixed cultures but not neuronal culture. IL-1?-mediated GSH enhancement rendered protection to mixed culture against oxidative stress induced by the stressor tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). GSH production and the resultant protection were blocked by the inhibition of GSH transport through Mrp1. Additionally, IL-1? failed to increase GSH or to provide protection against t-BOOH toxicity in chimeric cultures made using il1r1 null mutant astrocytes (lacking a functional IL-1R1 receptor) indicating the necessity of astrocytic signaling for the observed phenomenon. Overall, these findings suggest that under certain conditions IL-1? may be an important stimulus for GSH production and consequent neuroprotection through astrocyte-specific signaling."
etd_733,Defects and Rearrangements in Disordered Solids,Physics,"disorder, jammed, vibration","In this thesis, I will investigate the properties of disordered materials under strain.  Disordered materials encompass a large variety of materials, including glasses, polymers, granular matter, dense colloids, and gels.  There is currently no constitutive equation based on microscopic observables that describes these materials. Given the prevalence and usefulness of these materials, we derive tools to aid our understanding of them.We develop a new method to isolate localized defects from extended vibrational modes in disordered solids.  This method augments particle interactions with an artificial potential that acts as a high-pass filter: it preserves small-scale structures while pushing extended vibrational modes to higher frequencies.  The low-frequency modes that remain are ``bare"" defects; they are exponentially localized without the quadrupolar tails associated with elastic interactions. We demonstrate that these localized excitations are excellent predictors of plastic rearrangements in the solid. We characterize several of the properties of these defects that appear in mesoscopic theories of plasticity, including their distribution of energy barriers, number density, and size, which is a first step in testing and revising continuum models for plasticity in disordered solids.We additionally study the properties of rearrangement types in 2D disordered packings of particles with a harmonic potential at a range of packing fractions above jamming.  We develop a generalizable procedure that classifies events by stress drop, energy drop, and reversibility under two protocols.  Somewhat surprisingly, we find a large population of contact change events that have no associated stress drop. Reversible events become more common at high pressures above a packing fraction of $\phi=0.865$, at which point line reversible events are more common than loop reversible events. At low pressures, irreversible events are associated with spatially extended events, while at high pressures reversible events are much more spatially localized."
etd_165,"Deficit Discourse, Urban Teachers' Work and the Blame Game",Cultural Foundations of Education,"Deficit thinking, Neoliberalism, Teacher labor, Urban education","This dissertation explores how urban public school teachers navigate the contradictory social position of having little power over their work and considerable power over their students. This qualitative interpretive study begins from a perspective that is attentive to and critical of both (a) neoliberal approaches to education, particularly the market-based, audit culture logics and practices that devalue, discipline and target teachers as workers, and (b) the racialized deficit discourse, a predominant framework in urban schools--often taken up by urban teachers--that blames poor urban youth and youth of color for school problems, constructs them as objects in need of control and correction, and misrepresents their families and communities. Rather than study urban teachers as simply figures worthy of defense from neoliberal effects or as objects worthy of blame for their deficit-inspired perspectives on urban students, this dissertation examines how urban teachers negotiate both of these powerful, complicated and often interrelated forces in their teaching. This research shines a light on urban teachers, not to add to their hypervisibility as problems, but to explore the complexities of urban teachers' work which are largely invisible. This multi-sited ethnography traces how teachers make sense of these blaming discourses in two urban educational contexts: Teach For America (TFA), a national program that recruits college graduates to teach in poor schools, and Project Voice, a small, university-based research project that aimed to develop a model for adults to collaborate with urban students to improve their schools. Findings indicate that despite that urban teachers were often critical of the neoliberal pressures that constrained their work, the deficit discourse constructed urban students themselves as primary constraints for teachers. Deficit discourse was not all-encompassing, and some teachers resisted it, but deficit thinking seemed to intensify in conjunction with neoliberalism."
etd_35,"Déjà Viewed: Nation, Gender, and Genre in Bollywood Remakes of Hollywood Cinema",English,"Bollywood, Movies commercial aspects","Little has been written on transnational remakes. Most remake scholarship remains focused on Hollywood and explores issues of copyright and plagiarism or borrows from adaptation studies to interrogate concerns of homage, update, and anxiety of influence. On the other hand, while changes in the Bollywood film industry that have occurred since the 1990s--including its transnationalization, corporatization, and the related ideological mobilization of gender--have received a lot of critical attention, connections have yet to be made between these changes in the industry and the increase in and audience awareness of Bollywood remakes. ""Déjà Viewed: Nation, Gender, and Genre in Bollywood Remakes of Hollywood Cinema"" connects and contributes to both conversations: instead of deliberating on issues of imitation that recreate hierarchical binaries between Hollywood and Bollywood, this project approaches remakes as economic products thus shifting discussion on remakes within a context of industrial practices. Furthermore, the dissertation analyzes the Bollywood remake as a gendered response to changes brought about by globalization and the liberalization of India's economy.""Déjà Viewed"" looks closely at the intersection of cultural and industrial transformation in the remakes from 1990s onwards by analyzing the representation of gender in several genres. I argue that the Bollywood remakes in the post-liberalization decades try to fall back on (and update) the codes and conventions previously utilized by post-independence Hindi cinema in the 1950s. In films of that era, women were figured as the repositories of an imagined idea of ""Indianness"" so that the nation could be modernized through men. However, the borrowing from Western texts in the nineties and the later decades has resulted in hybridic treatments of codes and conventions that defamiliarize gender representations, a development which I argue is symptomatic of the changes wrought within the industry since the 1990s as it sought expansion into Western markets. The first chapter analyzes the Bollywood remake as a metaphor for the industry's simultaneous embrace and rejection of Westernization through the translation of the female protagonist. The next two chapters focus on gender and feminist debates but also explore the blurred boundaries between remakes and other economic categories like cycles, genres and sequels especially in a cross-cultural context. The last two chapters analyze masculinity and queerness in remakes that also indulge in auteurist homage and post-modern intertextuality. These chapters are also chronological, thus charting the changing process of remake from un-acknowledged imitation to self-reflexive pastiche, a process which is also reflective of Bollywood's trajectory from a decentralized industry run by a few producers to a government sanctioned and corporation-backed institution."
etd_701,Delay QoS Provisioning and Optimal Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"delay, optimal resource allocation, QoS, wireless networks","Recent years have witnessed a significant growth in wireless communication and networking due to the exponential growth in mobile applications and smart devices, fueling unprecedented increase in both mobile data traffic and energy demand. Among such data traffic, real-time data transmissions in wireless systems require certain quality of service (QoS) constraints e.g., in terms of delay, buffer overflow or packet drop/loss probabilities, so that acceptable performance levels can be guaranteed for the end-users, especially in delay sensitive scenarios, such as live video transmission, interactive video (e.g., teleconferencing), and mobile online gaming. With this motivation, statistical queuing constraints are considered in this thesis, imposed as limitations on the decay rate of buffer overflow probabilities. In particular, the throughput and energy efficiency of different types of wireless network models are analyzed under QoS constraints, and optimal resource allocation algorithms are proposed to maximize the throughput or minimize the delay.In the first part of the thesis, the throughput and energy efficiency analysis for hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocols are conducted under QoS constraints. Approximations are employed for small QoS exponent values in order to obtain closed-form expressions for the throughput and energy efficiency metrics. Also, the impact of random arrivals, deadline constraints, outage probability and QoS constraints are studied. For the same system setting, the throughput of HARQ system is also analyzed using a recurrence approach, which provides more accurate results for any value of the QoS exponent. Similarly, random arrival models and deadline constraints are considered, and these results are further extended to the finite-blocklength coding regime.Next, cooperative relay networks are considered under QoS constraints. Specifically, the throughput performance in the two-hop relay channel, two-way relay channel, and multi-source multi-destination relay networks is analyzed. Finite-blocklength codes are considered for the two-hop relay channel, and optimization over the error probabilities is investigated. For the multi-source multi-destination relay network model, the throughput for both cases of with and without CSI at the transmitter sides is studied. When there is perfect CSI at the transmitter, transmission rates can be varied according to instantaneous channel conditions. When CSI is not available at the transmitter side, transmissions are performed at fixed rates, and decoding failures lead to retransmission requests via an ARQ protocol.Following the analysis of cooperative networks, the performance of both half-duplex and full-duplex operations is studied for the two-way multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system under QoS constraints. In full-duplex mode, the self-interference inflicted on the reception of a user due to simultaneous transmissions from the same user is taken into account. In this setting, the system throughputis formulated by considering the sum of the effective capacities of the users in both half-duplex and full-duplex modes. The low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime is considered and the optimal transmission/power-allocation strategies are characterized by identifying the optimal input covariance matrices.Next, mode selection and resource allocation for device-to-device (D2D) cellular networks are studied. As the starting point,  ransmission mode selection and resource allocation are analyzed for a time-division multiplexed (TDM) cellular network with one cellular user, one base station, and a pair of D2D users under rate and QoS constraints. For a more complicated setting with multiple cellular and D2D users, two joint mode selection and resource allocation algorithms are proposed. In the first algorithm, the channel allocation problem is formulated as a maximum-weight matching problem, which can be solved by employing the Hungarian algorithm. In the second algorithm, the problem is divided into three subproblems, namely user partition, power allocation and channel assignment, and a novel three-step method is proposed by combining the algorithms designed for the three subproblems.In the final part of the thesis, resource allocation algorithms are investigated for content delivery over wireless networks. Three different systems are considered. Initially, a caching algorithm is designed, which minimizes the average delay of a single-cell network. The proposed algorithm is applicable in settings with very general popularity models, with no assumptions on how file popularity varies among different users, and this algorithm is further extended to a more general setting, in which the system parameters and the distributions of channel fading change over time. Next, for D2D cellular networks operating under deadline constraints, a scheduling algorithm is designed, which manages mode selection, channel allocation and power maximization with acceptable complexity. This proposed scheduling algorithm is designed based on the convex delay cost method for a D2D cellular network with deadline constraints in an OFDMA setting. Power optimization algorithms are proposed for all possible modes, based on our utility definition. Finally, a two-step intercell interference (ICI)-aware scheduling algorithm is proposed for cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), which performs user grouping and resource allocation with the goal of minimizing delay violation probability. A novel user grouping algorithm is developed for the user grouping step, which controls the interference among the users in the same group, and the channel assignment problem is formulated as a maximum-weight matching problem in the second step, which can be solved using standard algorithms in graph theory."
cie_etd_33,"Deposition and Fate of Atmospheric Mercury in Forested Landscapes of the Adirondack Park, NY",Civil and Environmental Engineering,Mercury,"In this dissertation, I investigated the deposition and fate of atmospheric mercury (Hg) to forested landscapes of the Adirondack region in Upstate New York. Despite the fact that forests are the dominant land cover in North America, there has been relatively little research on the deposition, transport, and fate of Hg within forested ecosystems. The objective of this dissertation was to quantify pathways of Hg deposition in forested sites in the Adirondack Park and to examine spatial and geographic patterns of Hg deposition and fate.The research for this dissertation was conducted in three phases. In Phase One, I compared and contrasted Hg deposition processes and Hg soil pools in a deciduous hardwood plot and a coniferous plot for 2009 and 2010 at Huntington Wildlife Forest. Mercury deposition due to litterfall was similar between the two stands, but total Hg deposition was greater in the coniferous plot due to larger fluxes of throughfall Hg. Soil evasion losses of Hg were significantly higher in the hardwood plot. Despite the fact that Hg deposition was greater and evasion losses were lower, soil Hg pools in the conifer plot were smaller than in the hardwood plot. The loss mechanism of Hg in the conifer stand is not clear. Annual variability in climate conditions was substantial between 2009 and 2010, and changes in Hg deposition quantities appear to be related to variation in temperature and precipitation quantity.In Phase Two of this dissertation, I evaluated the effects of elevation and landscape position on atmospheric Hg deposition. Two transects were established along the eastern and western sides of Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks. The 24 sample sites ranged from approximately 450-1450 m above sea level and covered three distinct forest types: deciduous/hardwood forest, spruce/fir conifer forest, and stunted growth alpine/fir forest. Throughfall Hg inputs and Hg accumulation in organic soils were greater in the spruce/fir and alpine areas than the deciduous forest areas. Estimates of cloud water Hg deposition demonstrate that cloud water is an important contributor to total Hg fluxes in alpine environments. Total Hg deposition was correlated to Hg concentrations in organic soil layers. Variation in both physical orographic effects and biological forest types appear to drive Hg deposition processes along this mountainous elevation gradient.In Phase Three of this study, I evaluated spatial patterns of Hg deposition by collecting canopy foliage and organic soils from 45 different plots across the Adirondack Park. The results showed species-specific differences in foliar uptake of Hg with the lowest concentrations found in first-year growth conifer needles and the highest concentrations found in black cherry (Prunus serotina). Latitude and longitude were negatively correlated with Hg concentrations in foliage and humus layer soils, while elevation was positively correlated with Hg concentrations in foliage and humus layer soils. Elemental analysis of foliage and soil also showed strong, positive correlations between Hg concentrations and nitrogen concentrations in foliage and soil. The spatial patterns of Hg deposition within the Adirondack Park are similar to patterns found for other atmospheric contaminants that originate largely from combustion sources, such as nitrogen and sulfur."
etd_538,Depressive Symptoms as a Longitudinal Predictor of Sexual Risk Behaviors among  African American Adolescents: Findings from Project iMPPACS,Psychology,"depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, sexual risk","Research that clarifies individual level factors associated with sexual risk behavior among African American adolescents remains an important public health priority. The current study examined the longitudinal association of depressive symptoms to sexual risk behaviors, and determined whether the association of depressive symptoms to risky sex varies as a function of gender in a sample of African American adolescents. A secondary aim was to examine whether self-efficacy for sex refusal and condom use mediate the depression-sexual risk relationship. Data analyses focused on baseline and three-month assessments of depressive symptoms and sexual behaviors assessed for the previous three-months, including: (a) engagement in vaginal sex; (b) having two or more sexual partners; (c) relative frequency of condom use; and (d) condom use at last sex. Analyses confirmed that depressive symptoms predict sex with two or more partners and both indices of inconsistent condom use. Further, gender moderates the association of depression and sex with two or more partners, such that depressive symptoms are a more powerful risk factor for females relative to males. Lastly, mediation analyses revealed that condom use self-efficacy significantly mediates the effects of depressive symptoms on inconsistent condom use. Depression is not a significant predictor of sexual activity status, nor did sex refusal self-efficacy mediate the association of depressive symptoms to engagement in vaginal sex or having two or more sexual partners. Nonetheless, current study findings have important implications for HIV/STI prevention, where behavioral interventions may benefit from modules that include a focus on the influence of mood on sexual behaviors and self-efficacy for safer sex practices."

The intermediate 3-amino-4-chloropyridinium trifluoroacetate salt combined with trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) effectively facilitates condensation with a carbonyl moiety. The corresponding imine is subsequently reduced using sodium triacetoxyborohydride. The product, N-alkyl-3-amino-4-halopyridines, provides an effective synthon for our previously reported synthesis of imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines. The current approach greatly improves upon previously alkylation methods of these aryl amines; providing an expanded substrate scope with excellent yields."
etd_106,"Describing students' talk about physical science phenomena outside and inside the classroom: A case of secondary school students from Maragoli, Western region of Kenya",Science Teaching,"Cultural knowledge, Science education, Science learning outside the classroom, Students' talk in science","Because of cultural and linguistic influences on science learning involving students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, calls have been made for teachers to enact teaching that is sensitive to these students' backgrounds. However, most of the research involving such students has tended to focus on students at elementary grade levels from predominantly two linguistic backgrounds, Hispanic and Haitian Creole, learning science concepts mainly in the life sciences. Also, most of the studies examined classroom interactions between teachers and the students and among students. Not much attention had been paid to how students talk about ideas inherent in scientific phenomena in an outside-the-classroom context and much less on how that talk relates to that of the classroom. Thus, this research extends knowledge in the area of science learning involving students learning science in a language other than their first language to include students from a language background other than Hispanic and Haitian Creole at not only the high school level but also their learning of ideas in a content area other than the life science (i.e., the physical sciences).  More importantly, this research extends knowledge in the area by relating science learning outside and inside the classroom.This dissertation describes this exploratory research project that adopted a case study strategy. The research involved seven Form Two (tenth grade) students (three boys and four girls) from one public, mixed gender day secondary school in rural Kenya. I collected data from the students through focus group discussions as they engaged in talking about ideas inherent in selected physical science phenomena and activities they encountered in their everyday lives, as well as learned about in their science classrooms. I supplemented these data with data from one-on-one semi-structured interviews with two teachers (one for chemistry and one for physics) on their teaching of ideas investigated in this research, the secondary school syllabus (KIE, 2002) as well as the students' responses to questions on teacher-made assessments involving the ideas investigated.Three main findings emerged through this research. The findings are: (1) the students adopted everyday ways of making sense of the world (i.e., everyday language and everyday observations) in talking about ideas investigated both outside- and inside-the-classroom contexts, (2) cultural knowledge emerged from the student's talk related to the nature and form of lightning different from that emphasized in science, and (3) students who may initially seem uninterested in participating in discussions involving science ideas showed possibilities for participation in such discussions. Drawing on the work of scholars such as Aikenhead (2001), Ballenger (1997), Brock-Utne (2007), Herbel-Eisenmann (2002) and Warren et al. (2001), I argue that students' everyday ways of makings sense of the world are rich starting points from which to leverage students towards meaningful learning in science. However, this may happen only if instructional materials such as the syllabus are explicit in not only giving examples of phenomena and students' experiences with them in outside the classroom contexts, but also acknowledging that possibilities exist for cultural understanding and talk about ideas inherent in the phenomena involving ideas students learn about in their science classrooms."
cfe_etd_56,"Desegregation in a ""Color-Blind"" Era: Parents Navigating School Assignment and Choice in Louisville, KY",Cultural Foundations of Education,"busing, color-blind racism, cultural reproduction, desegregation, school assignment, school choice","This dissertation is a qualitative study of how parents in Louisville, Kentucky navigate the marketplace of schools. The study focuses on how parents choose schools in a metropolitan area where the primary public school district, Jefferson County Public Schools, which was originally racially desegregated by court order, instituted an assignment plan that relies on a measure of race, income and education level in neighborhood clusters to assign students to schools. I argue that this assignment plan, although crafted to increase equity among students, is resisted by parental decision-making. Parents represent this resistance as ""color-blind,"" connected to the logistical and academic needs of their children. The study uses two levels of analysis: a policy analysis that examines the strengths and weaknesses of the assignment plan, and a critical analysis of how parents both understand the plan and use their cultural capital to reproduce their own social location through the school choice process."
etd_714,Design and Behavior of Steel Delta Girders,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Delta girder, finite element analysis, lateral-torsional buckling, residual stresses, shear capacity, torsional properties","In steel structures, I-sections are commonly used for beams and columns. These cross-sections usually lack lateral rigidity and torsional stiffness. An effective method to improve their lateral rigidity and overall flexural resistance is to weld two inclined rectangular plates to the compression flange and the compression portion of the web of hot-rolled or welded I-section to form what is known as a Delta girder. This mixed cross-section, i.e., cross-section composed of an open profile attached to a closed profile, can provide enhanced torsional stiffness and hence noticeably higher lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) capacity for the beam. While Delta girders can be used for any beams, their main applications are the design of crane runway and bridge beams and strengthening of existing beams.The main objectives of this dissertation are to study the static behavior of these girders and to provide a set of design equations for their nominal flexural and shear capacities. The research includes deriving closed-form equations for the cross-section properties of Delta girders. These equations are then verified against solutions obtained numerically. Using these cross-section properties, the theoretical lateral-torsional buckling capacity of Delta girders are determined and compared against results obtained from a finite element (FE) analysis. The results show that the theoretical LTB equation derived for general monosymmetric sections can be applied to these Delta girders. Additionally, it is shown that a simplified expression for the coefficient of monosymmetry ?x derived for I-sections can be used in the computation of the elastic LTB capacity of Delta girders. A parametric study is then performed based on elastic LTB capacity to demonstrate the effectiveness of Delta girders in achieving a favorable capacity-to-weight ratio when compared to standard I-section members.A refined three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear inelastic FE models are then developed to examine the capacity of simply-supported Delta girders under uniform bending and pure shear. The models take into considerations the effects of initial geometrical imperfections and residual stresses on the behavior of Delta girders. The FE model and the modeling techniques used are verified against the experimental result of a test beam that failed by inelastic LTB. The analysis covers a comprehensive range of Delta girder dimensions based on the dimensions of standard hot-rolled European H- and I-sections. A sensitivity study on the effects of using reduced imperfections magnitudes shows up to 18.2% increase in the LTB capacity of the girder.Based on the FE LTB simulation results, it is shown that the buckling curve in the AISC (2016a) specifications overestimates the buckling capacity of Delta girders by an average of 9% and a maximum value of 21%. On the other hand, buckling curves “a” and “b” for rolled sections or equivalent welded sections case in the EuroCode 3 (2005) for Delta girders with d?bc ?2 and d?bc >2, respectively, provide an average difference of only 2% and a maximum difference of 7% in comparison to the FE results. Hence, these two curves are recommended for the LTB design of Class 1 (compact) Delta girders. Additionally, design recommendations are provided for selecting the proper delta stiffeners dimensions based on the cross-section geometries of the corresponding I-sections.Shear capacity equations for Class 1 (compact) Delta girders are proposed based on FE simulation results. The equations provide the option of selecting a conservative value that ignores strain hardening in the cross-section or a value that allows for some strain hardening to occur. In comparison to I-sections, the Delta girders analyzed in this study show an increase in shear capacity in the range of 41% to 89%. Furthermore, it is shown that in contrast to I-sections, yielding is a gradual process in Delta girders due to the presence of a non-uniform elastic shear stress distribution in the cross-section."
etd_620,Design and development of an in vitro vascular model using 3D printing-enabled hydrogel casting technique,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"The inability to adequately vascularize tissues in vivo or in vitro currently limits the development of tissue engineering. Especially, to fabricate formation of functional vascular bed within the tissue construct is becoming the key challenge in tissue engineering. Answering the question on how to build up micro-channels in 3D environment to mimic the vascular structure and function inevitably becomes the essence of this challenge. As a first step towards address this problem, we aim to develop a functional blood vessel by using a Microfluidic device with relevant cell types using an easy-to-use 3D printing approach.In this work, we developed a strategy to mimic the vascular structure by using multicellular vascular channels are formed using a 3D printed template, which is then coated by using gelatin methacrylate hydrogel construct encapsulated with murine 10T1/2, and lined with human endothelial cells (HUVECs) within the channels. This approach has multiple advantages. 3D printing techniques offer an approach to fabricate complex geometries capable of controlling the geometry-induced flow changes precisely. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) was coated inside of the PDMS channel to form an inner layer. Then, GelMA layer laden with murine 10T1/2s cells is lined with a monolayer of human endothelial cells (HUVECs) to form the vascular inner environment. Lastly, high/low molecular weight dextran molecules conjugated with fluoresces were flowed through the channel to test the integration and diffusion features of the L-shape hydrogel microfluidic. Corresponding shear flow effects were demonstrated using COMSOL simulations. Overall, our work demonstrates a robust, inexpensive, and biocompatible method of developing a vascular model in user-defined geometry, with a potential for drug delivery research, tumor cells invasion research and disease modeling applications.Results prove that, first, 3D printing technique can be used to fabricate microfluidic devices. 3D printing is a low-cost, easy-to-use, fabrication method as compared to the expensive expertise-driven clean-room based lithography process used conventionally to fabricate microfluidic chips/devices. Secondly, gelatin methacrylate is an optimal biomaterial to facilitate nutrient diffusion and is sufficient to support cell viability of encapsulated 10T1/2 cells and HUVECs binding. Last, the L-shaped hydrogel microfluidic model performs a functional barrier both large/small molecular weight dextran molecules.This functional micro-vessel platform serves as a unique experimental tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms of vascular remodeling. In the future use, the fabrication strategy used in this work can be used for the tumor cell invasive research and vascular drug delivery tests."
etd_265,Design and Fabrication of Multicomponent Heterostructured Nanoparticles,Chemistry,,"The design and fabrication of sophisticated nanoparticle (NP) architectures are of increased desire as potential applications of these materials expand. In this dissertation research, I focus on designing and synthesizing heterostructured NPs, with complex morphology and tunable composition. Chapter 2 focuses on the synthesis of dumbbell NPs. I was able to make Au/Pd-Ag NPs, which are comprised of an Au core, and a Pd shell, where the addition of a third metal, Ag, yielded the epitaxial growth of Ag on one side of Au/Pd NP. Results suggest that with increased shell layers (n) of Ag, deposition occurs in a sub-monolayer fashion forming small-detached islands on the surface of the Au/Pd. By increasing n, these small islands eventually coalesce into one primary domain that resides asymmetrically with respect to the Au/Pd core. Chapter 3 uses the Au/Pd-Ag NPs as nano templates, where through the use of galvanic exchange, the composition of the heterostructure can be tuned to Au/Pd-Pt, Au/Pd-Au, or Au/Pd-Pd. More importantly, the finalized NPs all exhibited personalized morphology, of core/shell-hollow Au/Pd-Pt, core/shell-parachute Au/Pd-Au, and core/shell-uniform Au/Pd-Pd NPs. The respective systems were tested for catalytic activity, where Au/Pd-Pt nanoparticles exhibited superior catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation compared to its neighboring systems and a Pt/C standard. Finally, Chapter 5 discusses the work of catalytically active Au/Pt NPs, where modifications in the Pt morphology resulted in core/shell Au/Pt NPs or porous Au/Pt dumbbell NPs respectively. Catalytic comparison between the two systems demonstrated the higher catalytic activity of the porous Au/Pt dumbbell NP."

The design and synthesis of hybrid organic-inorganic materials constructed from various anionic polyoxomolybdate units and cationic secondary metal-ligand units, and the synthesis and ligand-exchange capacity of the giant polyoxomolybdate cluster Mo-132 are described. These studies aim to increase our understanding of the formation and physiochemical properties of these materials, and thereby aid in the ability to control and predict their structural chemistry.The analysis of a number of structural determinants in the oxomolybdenum-organodiphosphonate system aims to expand the current knowledge of this family of materials. We have focused on variables such as: the organic tether length of alkyldiphosphonate ligands; the size, flexibility, and number of nitrogen donor groups of secondary organoimine ligands; the oxidation state of the cationic transition metal center; and the incorporation of fluoride into the molybdodiphosphonate substructure.In order to explore the range of possible anionic charges that the polyoxomolybdate Mo-132 cluster may posses, ligand-exchange reactions were conducted. This has been accomplished through the incorporation of various ratios of ligands contributing different degrees of anionic charge into the molybdate framework.

The xylyldiphosphonate families of materials which were examined were the metal(II) series of Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, Cd and Zn, with an addition of an organo-nitrogen chelate. With success in these families of materials, a secondary metal of vanadium or molybdenum was added to these metal(II) systems to increase the complexity of the structure produced. For the organoarsonate series of compounds, the chemistry of the Mo/metal(II)/organoarsonate/organo-nitrogen chelate family of materials was expanded upon and preliminary studies were conducted into the V/metal(II)/organoarsonate/organo-nitrogen chelate group of materials.The analysis of a number of structural determinants in the xylyldiphosphonate family of compounds aims to expand upon the current knowledge of metal-diphosphonate chemistry. We have focused on variables such as the xylyldiphosphonate ligand used- whether 1,4-, 1,3- or 1,2-xylyldiphosphonate. Furthermore, we have varied the denticity and size of the organo-nitrogen co-ligand. We have also investigated the incorporation of fluoride into the vanadium and molybdenum series of compounds. Through our examination of these systems we have discovered that all possible dimensionalities are represented in the xylyldiphosphonate series of compounds; we postulate that the unique flexibility of the xylyldiphosphonate ligands allows a number of unique structures to be produced.In expanding upon the organoarsonate family of materials we have discovered the preferences for molecular structures in the Mo/metal(II)/organoarsonate/organo-nitrogen chelate family of materials. In our preliminary studies of the vanadium group of materials, a one-dimensional chain was produced and with a minor change in reaction conditions we saw a drastic structural change which yielded a mixed-dimensional structure consisting of clusters and chains. We conclude that minor changes in reaction conditions can lead to large structural changes with the use of hydrothermal synthesis."
etd_393,"Design of a High Capacity, Scalable, and Green Wireless Communication System Leveraging the Unlicensed Spectrum",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"4G Wireless Networks, Distributed & Parallel Processing, Interference Mitigiation, LTE-U, Performance Optimization, Unlicensed Spectrum","The stunning demand for mobile wireless data that has been recently growing at an exponential rate requires a several fold increase in spectrum. The use of unlicensed spectrum is thus critically needed to aid the existing licensed spectrum to meet such a huge mobile wireless data traffic growth demand in a cost effective manner. The deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE) in the unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) has recently been gaining significant industry momentum. The lower transmit power regulation of the unlicensed spectrum makes LTE deployment in the unlicensed spectrum suitable only for a small cell. A small cell utilizing LTE-L (LTE in licensed spectrum), and LTE-U (LTE in unlicensed spectrum) will therefore significantly reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a small cell, while providing the additional mobile wireless data offload capacity from Macro Cell to small cell in LTE Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), to meet such an increase in wireless data demand. The U.S. 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) bands that are currently under consideration for LTE deployment in the unlicensed spectrum contain only a limited number of 20 MHZ channels. Thus in a dense multi-operator deployment scenario, one or more LTE-U small cells have to co-exist and share the same 20 MHz unlicensed channel with each other and with the incumbent Wi-Fi.This dissertation presents a proactive small cell interference mitigation strategy for improving the spectral efficiency of LTE networks in the unlicensed spectrum. It describes the scenario and demonstrate via simulation results, that in the absence of an explicit interference mitigation mechanism, there will be a significant degradation in the overall LTE-U system performance for LTE-U co-channel co-existence in countries such as U.S. that do not mandate Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) regulations. An unlicensed spectrum Inter Cell Interference Coordination (usICIC) mechanism is then presented as a time-domain multiplexing technique for interference mitigation for the sharing of an unlicensed channel by multi-operator LTE-U small cells.  Through extensive simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed usICIC mechanism will result in 40% or more improvement in the overall LTE-U system performance (throughput) leading to increased wireless communication system capacity.The ever increasing demand for mobile wireless data is also resulting in a dramatic expansion of wireless network infrastructure by all service providers resulting in significant escalation in energy consumption by the wireless networks. This not only has an impact on the recurring operational expanse (OPEX) for the service providers, but importantly the resulting increase in greenhouse gas emission is not good for the environment. Energy efficiency has thus become one of the critical tenets in the design and deployment of Green wireless communication systems. Consequently the market trend for next-generation communication systems has been towards miniaturization to meet this stunning ever increasing demand for mobile wireless data, leading towards the need for scalable distributed and parallel processing system architecture that is energy efficient, and high capacity. Reducing cost and size while increasing capacity, ensuring scalability, and achieving energy efficiency requires several design paradigm shifts.This dissertation presents the design for a next generation wireless communication system that employs new energy efficient distributed and parallel processing system architecture to achieve these goals while leveraging the unlicensed spectrum to significantly increase (by a factor of two) the capacity of the wireless communication system. This design not only significantly reduces the upfront CAPEX, but also the recurring OPEX for the service providers to maintain their next generation wireless communication networks."

Various models and approaches have been proposed, but current thinking on a ""design science"" for HCI is in flux.This multi-paper dissertation draws upon existing literature from HCI, various design communities, and information systems (IS) to develop a new model of design science: the theory, design, and evaluation (TDE) model. The TDE model, informed by an included research paper, envisions that scholarly activities and design activities can occur in parallel across the three stages of theory, design, and evaluation.The TDE model is demonstrated using an additional three included papers, each one taken from a separate TDE design science project. These ongoing projects occur in widely varied contexts - gaming for citizen science, online nuisances, and military history education - but each has the TDE model as its central organizing structure. The papers are examples of TDE knowledge outcomes, but also address design outcomes from each project. The three projects are analyzed and connected directly to various elements of the TDE model itself. In addition, the final chapter describes future directions for the three projects and the TDE model, as well as thinking on the importance of design science in HCI scholarship."
etd_685,"Design, Material and Surgical Assembly Effects on Fretting Corrosion Behavior of Modular Tapers in Orthopedic Implants",Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"biomechanics, corrosion, electrochemistry, hip implants, medical device, orthopedic","Mechanically assisted crevice corrosion (MACC) has become a significant problem in the orthopedic device industry, particularly in modular devices with metal-on-metal (MoM) tapered interfaces. Oxide film abrasion, leading to fretting corrosion in the presence of a crevice, accelerates the corrosion process and in some instances may lead to failure of the implant. Failure is defined as the need for revision surgery. The basic processes of oxide film abrasion and repassivation, and the associated effects (chemical, transport, mechanical and electrical) of these processes have been well described and studied over time.Despite these advancements, there is much that is still not well understood about modular taper performance and the role of design, materials, surgical techniques and biological factors, and their effects on MACC performance. For example, the load-displacement behavior of taper junctions during seating, the effect of seating load magnitude, rate of loading and loading orientation, and the role of taper contamination on seating mechanics, pull-off mechanics and MACC behavior remain to be well understood. In addition, few studies have been carried out to improve the understanding of the relationship between MACC, local tissue reaction, taper design and material combination.Thus, with continued concerns surrounding fretting corrosion and MACC of modular taper junctions there is a continuing need to develop appropriate in vitro tests to evaluate the roles of specific design, material and surgical techniques. These concepts are complex, interdependent and need to be clearly understood for effective design of, and surgical practice using modular taper junctions. Therefore, the goals of this dissertation are to systematically assess the effects of seating mechanics in terms of load magnitude, load rate and load orientation, contamination, taper design and material combination on the MACC behavior of head-neck taper junctions and taper locking stability (pull-off behavior) for commercially-used total hip replacements. The information provided from these studies offers a more detailed understanding of the interactions that arise between taper design and material combination based on surgical techniques and taper contamination in reference to taper fretting motions and corrosion.Preliminary testing consisted of a novel test protocol in which the seating (load-displacement) behavior and taper pull-off load were monitored in 12/14 Ti6Al4V/CoCrMo modular taper junctions. The seating behavior for four load magnitudes, three load orientations and five contamination groups was reported. The results showed an increase in seating load magnitude increased seating displacement, work of seating and the taper pull-off load while an increase in load orientation (to 20°) had no significant effect. Taper contamination testing presented findings which suggest the inclusion of lipids into the junction resulted in increased taper stability. The presence of contaminants increased seating displacement and work of seating compared to a control (dry) taper.Fretting corrosion testing incorporated identical taper testing conditions (load magnitude, orientation and contamination) and underwent incremental cyclic fretting corrosion testing. The goal was to investigate the effects of taper seating conditions on fretting motions and fretting corrosion. The outcome of testing highlighted the significant effects of taper seating conditions on each sample group. In the seating load magnitude groups, a correlation between subsidence and current at the end of testing was reported. An increased seating load orientation reduced micromotion throughout testing and the average onset load but had no effect on subsidence, current at the end of testing or taper pull-off. And the introduction of lipid contaminants into the taper junction reduced fretting corrosion currents.Lastly, the effects of taper geometry (C taper vs. V40 taper) and material combination (Ti-6Al-4V/CoCrMo vs. TMZF (Ti-Mo-Zr-Fe)/CoCrMo) as well as load rate and compliance were investigated using novel methodologies. The findings from these studies showed changes in the taper geometry affected the stiffness of the construct, fretting motions and the fretting corrosion performance while material combination had no significant effect. In terms of load rate and compliance, the study presented evidence to suggest load rate and system compliance had no significant effect on work of seating or taper locking stability."
eecs_etd_330,"Design, Modeling and Analysis of Non-classical Field Effect Transistors",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"FinFET, HEMT, III-V compound, semiconductor, simulation, TCAD","Transistor scaling following per Moore's Law slows down its pace when entering into nanometer regime where short channel effects (SCEs), including threshold voltage fluctuation, increased leakage current and mobility degradation, become pronounced in the traditional planar silicon MOSFET. In addition, as the demand of diversified functionalities rises, conventional silicon technologies cannot satisfy all non-digital applications requirements because of restrictions that stem from the fundamental material properties. Therefore, novel device materials and structures are desirable to fuel further evolution of semiconductor technologies. In this dissertation, I have proposed innovative device structures and addressed design considerations of those non-classical field effect transistors for digital, analog/RF and power applications with projected benefits. Considering device process difficulties and the dramatic fabrication cost, application-oriented device design and optimization are performed through device physics analysis and TCAD modeling methodology to develop design guidelines utilizing transistor's improved characteristics toward application-specific circuit performance enhancement. Results support proposed device design methodologies that will allow development of novel transistors capable of overcoming limitation of planar nanoscale MOSFETs.In this work, both silicon and III-V compound devices are designed, optimized and characterized for digital and non-digital applications through calibrated 2-D and 3-D TCAD simulation. For digital functionalities, silicon and InGaAs MOSFETs have been investigated. Optimized 3-D silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and body-on-insulator (BOI) FinFETs are simulated to demonstrate their impact on the performance of volatile memory SRAM module with consideration of self-heating effects. Comprehensive simulation results suggest that the current drivability degradation due to increased device temperature is modest for both devices and corresponding digital circuits. However, SOI FinFET is recommended for the design of low voltage operation digital modules because of its faster AC response and better SCEs management than the BOI structure. The FinFET concept is also applied to the non-volatile memory cell at 22 nm technology node for low voltage operation with suppressed SCEs.In addition to the silicon technology, our TCAD estimation based on upper projections show that the InGaAs FinFET, with superior mobility and improved interface conditions, achieve tremendous drive current boost and aggressively suppressed SCEs and thereby a strong contender for low-power high-performance applications over the silicon counterpart. For non-digital functionalities, multi-fin FETs and GaN HEMT have been studied. Mixed-mode simulations along with developed optimization guidelines establish the realistic application potential of underlap design of silicon multi-Fin FETs for analog/RF operation. The device with underlap design shows compromised current drivability but improve analog intrinsic gain and high frequency performance. To investigate the potential of the novel N-polar GaN material, for the first time, I have provided calibrated TCAD modeling of E-mode N-polar GaN single-channel HEMT. In this work, I have also proposed a novel E-mode dual-channel hybrid MIS-HEMT showing greatly enhanced current carrying capability. The impact of GaN layer scaling has been investigated through extensive TCAD simulations and demonstrated techniques for device optimization."

This phenomenon can also be used for multi-metallic nanoparticles (NPs), where in conjunction with the size effects induced by quantum confinement, new properties or phase behavior can emerge. The properties of nanoalloys are highly dependent on their composition and morphology, which are contingent upon the method in which they are synthesized. Finding ways to control, or even design, the composition and morphology of nanoalloys could potentially open the door for a standardized approach for creating nanomaterials with unique and desirable properties. In my dissertation research, I designed core/alloy NPs by manipulation of interfacial oxidation and atomic diffusion via galvanic exchange, Cabrera-Mott oxidation, and Kirkendall diffusion. A novel method for the fabrication of FeNi-M3O4 (M = Ni, Fe) heterostructures by galvanic exchange is discussed. Using ?-Fe NPs as a template, galvanic exchange was shown to occur if a significant redox potential occurs between the template nanoparticle and the deposition metal. Deposition of metallic Ni or Cr onto the Fe template NP allows for effective alloying as well as control over the symmetry of the final core/alloy NP morphology. Depending on alloy shell thickness, oxidation results in Kirkendall void formation essentially allowing for control over the morphology of hollow core/alloy NP. Formation of an outer oxide shell creates a stainless steel-like interface, which results in passivation from further oxidation. Finally, I describe Mn doping into ZnSe quantum dots, where energy transfer occurs from the host semiconductor, ZnSe, to the dopant excited state, which lies within the bandgap of the host material."

One such screen, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C; Bush, Kivlahan, McDonnell, Fihn, & Bradley, 1998), has yet to be validated for detecting at-risk alcohol consumption and negative drinking consequences among students presenting to a university student health service for primary care. Accordingly, the proposed study aimed to assess the construct validity of the AUDIT-C among students (N = 387) recruited from Syracuse University's University Health Service (UHS). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses were used to determine optimal cut-off scores for at-risk consumption and negative drinking consequences. Optimal cut-off scores were also examined separately by gender. Results support the construct validity and utility of the AUDIT-C as a screen for at-risk levels of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems among students presenting to UHS. Results also indicate optimal cut-off scores of 5 for females and 7 for males as indicators of at-risk consumption levels as well as likelihood of experiencing an elevated number of negative drinking consequences. These results support the use of the AUDIT-C in university primary care settings and have implications for screening and brief interventions for at-risk drinking."
etd_142,DETECTION OF DEMENTIA RISK IN PRIMARY CARE:  PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF A COMPOSITE DEMENTIA RISK SCORE IN VETERANS,Psychology,"Alzheimer's, Composite Risk, Dementia, Risk, Veterans","Dementia is becoming a significant public health concern as the United States population rapidly ages. Veterans, accounting for a substantial portion of the United States population, may be at even higher risk for developing dementia as they generally have more risk factors for dementia than the general population. The current study sought to develop a modifiable composite dementia risk score, based on routinely gathered data from the primary care setting, that would predict an individual's risk for developing dementia in 10 years. A composite risk score--based on age, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, current smoking, alcohol use disorder, and pulse pressure--was created using 10 years of Veterans' electronic medical record information. The predictive accuracy of the composite risk score was in the ""good"" range (AUC = 0.78) and less conservative estimates were even more accurate (AUC=0.85). The sensitivity was 50% and the specificity was 80%. This risk score is the first composite dementia risk score created for Veterans and provides optimism for future research in this area. Once further validated, this type of risk score could be seamlessly introduced into the primary care setting where its components are usually available. This type of assessment holds promise of being a considerable step forward in the prevention or delay or dementia onset in a rapidly aging Veteran population."

Confidentdetection of gravitational waves requires an understanding of instrumental noise transientsand artifacts that can reduce the sensitivity of a search for gravitational waves.Studies of the quality of the detector data yield insights into the cause of instrumentalartifacts and data quality vetoes specific to a search are produced to mitigate theeffects of problematic data.This dissertation provides an overview of the methods used to characterize noisein the LIGO interferometers and provides examples of successful removal of transientnoise. The data set used in the first observing run is validated. Further, the systematicremoval of noisy data from analysis time is shown to improve the sensitivity of searchesfor compact binary coalescences. The output of the PyCBC pipeline is used as ametric for improvement.The first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914, was a loud enoughsignal that removing data with excess noise did not improve its significance. However,the removal of data with excess noise decreased the false alarm rate of GW151226 bya factor of 567, from 1 in 320 years (3.9 ?) to 1 in 183000 years (> 5.3 ?)."

Transnationalism is an increasingly dominant phenomenon that characterizes the way in which diaspora groups live their lives across borders. In fact, refugee diaspora, like the Vietnamese Americans, signify a unique dimension in the arena of transnational political practices, given their potential for raising awareness about their country's political struggles and affecting change.     The central argument of this dissertation is that a stable and significant transnational field of political action connecting Vietnamese Americans with their country of origin does exist. My research demonstrates that certain practices - protests, petitions and participation in internet forums - emerge as the most frequent forms of transnational political activity that Vietnamese Americans engage in. This dissertation adds insights to the transnationalism literature from the perspective of a vehemently anti-communist community that fled from political violence or the threat thereof - thus, all three forms of political action have a strong anti-communist agenda.     My dissertation speaks directly to the fact that the dynamics of political transnationalism among Vietnamese Americans are not uniform. Rather, demographic, contextual and socio-economic factors foster or hamper their political mobilization. From the logistic regression analyses, political transnationalism among Vietnamese Americans is found to be significantly associated with age, gender, college degree, arrival in the U.S., English proficiency, employment status and income. Vietnamese Americans who are most likely to engage in protesting and sign petitions are older males who arrived in the U.S. during the early waves of refugee influx and are not very proficient in English. Unemployed Vietnamese Americans with lower incomes are also more likely to attend protests, while obtaining a college degree in both the U.S. and Vietnam is associated with more frequent participation in internet forums related to homeland issues"

The LHCb detector is a single arm forward spectrometer and is designed to perform high precision measurements of Charge Parity (CP) violation parameters and rare decays of the beauty and charm hadrons. The detector was successfully operated at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2010 and 2011 and at 8 TeV in 2012. Over 3 fb-1 of data has been collected by the LHCb. The LHCb experiment is also well suited for studies on hadron spectroscopy.Besides the well established mesons consisting of quark-antiquark pairs (qq-bar), it has been proposed that ""exotic"" qqq-barq-bar mesons could exist. One of the candidates for a four-quark state is the charmonium-like state X(3872) which was first observed by the Belle experiment in 2003. This narrow state has a mass of about 3872 MeV which is located in a region of excited charmonium states (cc-bar). However its mass does not match to any theoretically predicted charmonium state. In order to investigate the nature of this anomalous state, we analyze its quantum number which is the key for its interpretation. The X(3872) events are reconstructed from B+->X(3872)K+, where X(3872)->pi+ pi- J/psi , J/psi->mu+mu-; based on 1 fb-1 of 2011 data collected by LHCb detector. We implement a method which is guaranteed by statistics to be the most powerful way to discriminate between spin hypotheses; namely unbinned likelihood ratio test using full angular phase-space. The 5-dimensional analysis shows that 1++ hypothesis is preferred with overwhelming significance. The only alternative assignment allowed by the previous measurements, JPC = 2-+, is rejected with a confidence level equivalent to more than eight Gaussian standard deviations. This result favors exotic explanations of the X(3872) state, such as a mesonic molecule or a tetraquark."
etd_299,Developing a Framework for Stigmergic Human Collaboration with Technology Tools: Cases in Emergency Response,School of Information Studies,"emergency response, geospatial technology, human cognitive stigmergy, mass collaboration, social media","Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs), particularly social media and geographic information systems (GIS), have become a transformational force in emergency response. Social media enables ad hoc collaboration, providing timely, useful information dissemination and sharing, and helping to overcome limitations of time and place. Geographic information systems increase the level of situation awareness, serving geospatial data using interactive maps, animations, and computer generated imagery derived from sophisticated global remote sensing systems. Digital workspaces bring these technologies together and contribute to meeting ad hoc and formal emergency response challenges through their affordances of situation awareness and mass collaboration. Distributed ICTs that enable ad hoc emergency response via digital workspaces have arguably made traditional top-down system deployments less relevant in certain situations, including emergency response (Merrill, 2009; Heylighen, 2007a, b). Heylighen (2014, 2007a, b) theorizes that human cognitive stigmergy explains some self-organizing characteristics of ad hoc systems. Elliott (2007) identifies cognitive stigmergy as a factor in mass collaborations supported by digital workspaces. Stigmergy, a term from biology, refers to the phenomenon of self-organizing systems with agents that coordinate via perceived changes in the environment rather than direct communication. In the present research, ad hoc emergency response is examined through the lens of human cognitive stigmergy. The basic assertion is that ICTs and stigmergy together make possible highly effective ad hoc collaborations in circumstances where more typical collaborative methods break down. The research is organized into three essays: an in-depth analysis of the development and deployment of the Ushahidi emergency response software platform, a comparison of the emergency response ICTs used for emergency response during Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and a process model developed from the case studies and relevant academic literature is described."
etd_174,Developing Critical Loads and Dynamic Critical Loads for Acidification for Watersheds in the Adirondack region of New York and Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GRSM),Civil and Environmental Engineering,"acidification, Adirondacks, Critical Loads, Dynamic Critical Loads, Great Smoky Mountain, Sulfate and nitrate","Critical loads (CLs) and dynamic critical loads (DCLs) are important tools for the management of ecosystems that are impacted by high sulfate, nitrate and ammonium deposition. In this study, a biogeochemical model (PnET-BGC) was applied to 20 watersheds in the Adirondack region and 12 watersheds in Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GRSM) to calculate CLs and DCLs. I evaluated ecosystem changes in response to historical and potential future changes in acidic deposition. I analyzed factors affecting CLs and DCLs for acidification in the acid impacted Constable Pond Watershed in the Adirondack region, specifically evaluating trade-offs of sulfate and nitrate deposition, supply of dissolved organic carbon, land disturbance and lake hydrological residence time. I also calculated CLs and DCLs for 20 watersheds in the Adirondack Region. Based on chemical indicators (acid neutralizing capacity-ANC and soil base saturation) and biological indicators (fish and total zooplankton species richness). I defined two metrics - historical acidification and maximum recovery based on changes in ANC. I explored the factors affecting historical acidification and maximum recovery. I determined the conditions where acidified lakes can recover and the long-term sustained deposition loads that would be required to achieve such recovery and identified the types of watersheds for which recovery is unlikely, regardless of the emission reductions. I also projected the response of aquatic species (fish and total zooplankton species richness) to historical and potential future changes in acidic deposition. Using methods similar to those developed for the Adirondack region, I also applied PnET-BGC to the GRSM region to obtain CLs and DCLs and evaluated how watershed-ecosystems changed in response to historical and future decreases in NO3-, SO42- and NH4+ deposition.Results from Constable Pond watershed showed that ANC increased more in response to equivalent decreases in SO42- deposition than NO3- deposition. Moreover, DOC in the surface water, lake hydrological residence time and forest cutting disturbance had substantial effects on historical acidification and the recovery of lake ANC.Results from lakes of the Adirondack region also showed that future increases in ANC will be accomplished more effectively in response to further decreases in SO42- deposition than in NO3- deposition. Historical acidification was related to the current deposition of SO42-+NO3-, Ca2+ weathering rate, and pre-industrial ANC (~1850). Lake recovery was likewise related with the current deposition of SO42-+NO3-, Ca2+ weathering rate and current ANC. Fish and total zooplankton species richness are projected to increase under decreases in SO42- or NO3- deposition. However, complete chemical and biological recovery will not be attainable by 2200 even under decreases in atmospheric deposition to pre-industrial conditions.Results from the GRSM showed that ANC in the future will also increase in response to decreases in acidic deposition. However, ANC increases will be accomplished more effectively with decreases in NO3- than in SO42- deposition. This difference in response is due to the strong retention of SO42- by soil adsorption in this unglaciated landscape, coupled with the limited watershed retention of atmospheric N deposition. Historical acidification and maximum recovery were also related to Ca2+ weathering rate and pre-industrial ANC. Some watersheds are projected to achieve target ANC in the future under different DCLs for SO42-+NO3- deposition. Other GRSM watersheds will not be able to achieve target ANC in the future due to sensitive soil conditions and are experiencing watershed N saturation"
etd_466,Developing iodine proxies for oceanic oxygenation conditions during greenhouse episodes,Earth Sciences,"greenhouse climate, I/Ca, I/TOC, OAE 2, PETM, redox","Anthropogenic global warming affects marine ecosystems in complex ways, and declining ocean oxygenation is a growing concern. Forecasting the geographical and bathymetric extent, rate, and intensity of future deoxygenation and its ecological effects, however, remains highly challenging because of the complex feedbacks in the climate-ocean-biota system. Global warming lowers the solubility of oxygen in the ocean and drives an enhanced hydrological cycle with increased nutrient delivery to the oceans, leading to increases in organic production, the degradation of which causes a further decrease in dissolved oxygen. In extreme cases in the geological past, this trajectory has led to strong marine oxygen depletion during the so-called oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). How the water column oscillated between generally oxic conditions and local/global anoxia remains a challenging question, exacerbated by a lack of sensitive redox proxies, especially at the interface between oxic and anoxic conditions. To address this problem, I use I/Ca in bulk carbonate and I/TOC in black shale to reconstruct redox changes in the upper and deep waters in multiple ocean basins through the Cretaceous OAE 2 at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (94 Ma). The iodine proxy records are interpreted in the context of a wide range of other geochemical data and Earth system biogeochemical model simulations.Iodate and iodide are the most thermodynamically stable iodine ions in seawater. The speciation of iodine depends on the redox condition of the ambient seawater. Iodate is abundant in oxic water, and iodide dominates in anoxic water. Iodate is the only iodine ion that can precipitate with carbonate, and carbonate associated iodine increases with iodate concentration in the matrix solution. Therefore, I/Ca values in carbonate can be used as a redox proxy of seawater.In general, I/Ca ratios were relatively low preceding and during the OAE interval, indicating deep suboxic or anoxic waters exchanging directly with near-surface waters. However, individual sites display a wide range of initial values and variability in I/Ca through the OAE interval, reflecting the importance of local controls and potentially suggesting a high spatial variability in redox state. Both I/Ca and cGENIE model suggest that the northeast proto-Atlantic had notably higher oxygen levels in the upper water column than the rest of the North Atlantic, highlighting important regional differences in redox conditions during OAE 2. A lack of correlation with calcium, lithium, and carbon isotope records suggests that neither enhanced global weathering nor carbon burial was a dominant control on the I/Ca proxy during OAE 2.I/TOC and Iorg records were generated from six sections in proto-North Atlantic and southern Indian Ocean. I/TOC in modern surface and subsurface sediment decreases with decreasing bottom-water oxygen, a feature potentially useful for reconstructing seafloor paleo-redox. I/TOC decreases into OAE 2, suggesting more reducing bottom-water conditions. Higher I/TOC values (more oxic conditions) are recorded in two high-latitude and possibly in one low-latitude site, where higher oxygen levels are also indicated by other redox indicators and Earth System Modeling by cGENIE. I/TOC and I/Ca records at a near-equatorial coastal site in Morocco (Tarfaya) decreased during OAE 2, likely suggesting reducing water throughout the water column due to strong vertical mixing and shallow paleo-depth, consistent with a wide range of other proxies. These observations indicate that coeval carbonate and shale iodine records may be able to depict oxygenation changes in different parts of the water column, and reflect the change in marine iodine reservoir.Another rapid global warming event, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~55.5 Ma), may represent a better analog for present and future global warming. I apply the iodine to calcium ratio (I/Ca) in bulk coarse fraction sediment and planktonic foraminiferal tests from pelagic sites in different oceans, and compared the reconstruction with modeled oxygen levels. The reconstructed iodate gradients indicate that deoxygenation occurred in the upper water column in the Atlantic, Indian Oceans, and possibly the Pacific Ocean, as well during the PETM, due to vertical and potentially lateral expansion of OMZs.Overall, this thesis further establishes the use of iodine as a proxy for ocean oxygen levels in the geological history."

For that reason, it is reasonable to assume that lesson study can help schools and teachers implement the Common Core State Standards and the Standards for Mathematical Practice in the United States. Yet, lesson study can take on many forms and can be difficult to integrate or adapt effectively to improve instruction. This research study explored case studies of five teachers at a K-6 public, elementary school as they went through the process of lesson study, developed mathematical-task knowledge, and made changes to their instruction. Mathematical-task knowledge includes the knowledge needed to use worthwhile, cognitively demanding mathematical tasks to increase students’ conceptual understanding and to provide students with rich opportunities to learn mathematics. Data included: (1) classroom observations and semi-structured interviews with teachers before and after lesson study, (2) video and observational notes of all lesson study meetings, and (3) classroom and lesson artifacts. This study answers the following research question: How does lesson study contribute to the development of teachers' mathematical-task knowledge, including teachers’ abilities to understand, select, modify, and implement cognitively demanding tasks? Findings revealed how features of lesson study created unique pathways for learning for each teacher. Each teacher added to their understanding of worthwhile mathematical tasks in different ways. Features of lesson study prompted teachers to collaborate on solving and analyzing tasks that varied in terms of cognitive demand, to anticipate student strategies, to explore curricular resources, to observe students working on challenging tasks, and to collect evidence on student thinking demonstrating students’ understanding, difficulties and misconceptions. As a result these teachers reflect on their knowledge and practice, and altered the way they selected or modified mathematical tasks. Findings demonstrated that many of the teachers still required support around implementing tasks and facilitating mathematical discussion to support student thinking. Further lesson study cycles and inquiry around mathematical tasks and mathematics instruction would enable these teachers to continue to develop their knowledge and make lasting changes to their instructional practice."
etd_158,Development and Application of Explicitly Correlated Wave Function Based Methods for the Investigation of Optical Properties of Semiconductor Nanomaterials,Chemistry,"chemistry, electron hole, explicitly correlated, quantum dots, theoretical chemistry","Semiconductor nanoparticles, or quantum dots (QDs), are well known to have very unique optical and electronic properties. These properties can be controlled and tailored as a function of several influential factors, including but not limited to the particle size and shape, effect of composition and heterojunction as well as the effect of ligand on the particle surface. This customizable nature leads to extensive experimental and theoretical research on the capabilities of these quantum dots for many application purposes.However, in order to be able to understand and thus further the development of these materials, one must first understand the fundamental interaction within these nanoparticles.In this thesis, I have developed a theoretical method which is called electron-hole explicitly correlated Hartee-Fock (eh-XCHF). It is a variational method for solving the electron-holeSchrodinger equation and has been used in this work to study electron-hole interaction in semiconductor quantum dots. The method was benchmarked with respect to a parabolic quantum dot system, andground state energy and electron-hole recombination probability were computed. Both of these properties were found to be in good agreement with expected results. Upon successful benchmarking,I have applied the eh-XCHF method to study optical properties of several quantum dot systems including the effect of dot size on exciton binding energy and recombination probability in  a CdSe quantum dot, the effect of shape on a CdSe quantum dot, the effect of heterojunction on a CdSe/ZnS quantum dot and the effect of quantum dot-biomolecule interaction within a CdSe-firefly Luciferase protein conjugate system. As metrics for assessing the effect of these influencers on the electron-hole interaction, the exciton binding energy, electron-hole recombination probability and the average electron-hole separation distance have been computed. These excitonic properties have been found to be strongly infuenced by the changing composition of the particle. It has also been found through this work that the explicitly correlated method performs very well when computing these properties as it provides a feasible computational route to compare to both experimental and other theoretical results."
etd_169,Development and Delivery of a Brief Intervention to Reduce Suicidal Ideation among Veterans in a Primary Care Setting,Psychology,"Ecological Momentary Assessment, Primary Care, Suicidal Ideation, Suicide, Veteran","An elevated rate of suicide among Veterans remains a growing and pressing public health concern. Available interventions often lack empirical support or are too protracted and expensive to implement on a wide scale. Primary care represents a unique opportunity with which to engage those Veterans who are experiencing suicidal ideation. However, Veterans who are not at imminent risk often fall into a treatment gap and experience significant wait times until beginning treatment with a specialty mental healthcare provider. An efficacious intervention introduced into this gap in services may reduce suicidal ideation among Veterans and increase rates of follow-up with specialty care. One therapeutic intervention that has been identified as being efficacious in the reduction of suicidal ideation and suicidal self-directed violence is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). A brief intervention aimed at reducing suicidal ideation was piloted among a sample of Veterans enrolled in primary care at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (n = 4; 1 completed full protocol). The intervention drew on elements of DBT and included four brief training modules including (mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation). Using single-case experimental design methodology and ecological momentary assessment, preliminary data from daily assessments indicate this method of data collection is feasible and suggests that the emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness modules may help to reduce the variability of suicidal ideation, as well as alcohol consumption."
etd_464,Development and implementation of efficient noise suppression methods for emission computed tomography,Physics,"emisison computed tomography, iterative reconstruction, maximum a posteriori, penalized likelihood reconstruction, regularization, SPECT","In PET and SPECT imaging, iterative reconstruction is now widely used due to its capability of incorporating into the reconstruction process a physics model and Bayesian statistics involved in photon detection. Iterative reconstruction methods rely on regularization terms to suppress image noise and render radiotracer distribution with good image quality. The choice of regularization method substantially affects the appearances of reconstructed images, and is thus a critical aspect of the reconstruction process. Major contributions of this work include implementation and evaluation of various new regularization methods. Previously, our group developed a preconditioned alternating projection algorithm (PAPA) to optimize the emission computed tomography (ECT) objective function with the non-differentiable total variation (TV) regularizer. The algorithm was modified to optimize the proposed reconstruction objective functions.First, two novel TV-based regularizers—high-order total variation (HOTV) and infimal convolution total variation (ICTV)—were proposed as alternative choices to the customary TV regularizer in SPECT reconstruction, to reduce “staircase” artifacts produced by TV. We have evaluated both proposed reconstruction methods (HOTV-PAPA and ICTV-PAPA), and compared them with the TV regularized reconstruction (TV-PAPA) and the clinical standard, Gaussian post-filtered, expectation-maximization reconstruction method (GPF-EM) using both Monte Carlo-simulated data and anonymized clinical data. Model-observer studies using Monte Carlo-simulated data indicate that ICTV-PAPA is able to reconstruct images with similar or better lesion detectability, compared with clinical standard GPF-EM methods, but at lower detected count levels. This implies that switching from GPF-EM to ICTV-PAPA can reduce patient dose while maintaining image quality for diagnostic use.Second, the ?1 norm of discrete cosine transform (DCT)-induced framelet regularization was studied. We decomposed the image into high and low spatial-frequency components, and then preferentially penalized the high spatial-frequency components. The DCT-induced framelet transform of the natural radiotracer distribution image is sparse. By using this property, we were able to effectively suppress image noise without overly compromising spatial resolution or image contrast.Finally, the fractional norm of the first-order spatial gradient was introduced as a regularizer. We implemented ?2/3 and ?1/2 norms to suppress image spatial variability. Due to the strong penalty of small differences between neighboring pixels, fractional-norm regularizers suffer from similar cartoon-like artifacts as with the TV regularizer. However, when penalty weights are properly selected, fractional-norm regularizers outperform TV in terms of noise suppression and contrast recovery."
etd_497,DEVELOPMENT OF A “2-D” TEST SYSTEM FOR VISUALIZING FRETTING CORROSION: A STUDY OF THE FRETTING CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF Co-Cr-Mo ALLOY,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"Fretting corrosion, one of the most common forms of mechanically-assisted corrosion (MAC), has become a major concern in orthopedic medical devices. In order to a better understand of the mechanism of fretting corrosion in orthopedic alloys and the ways to prevent implants from corroding, custom test systems need to be developed to simulate fretting corrosion in vitro and to allow visualizing of the process. This study aimed to develop a new “two dimensional” fretting crevice corrosion test system with the capacity to visualize damage progression during systematic controlled fretting corrosion processes. Another goal of the study was to experimentally verify a tribocorrosion heredity integral approach to predict abrasion-current-impedance-voltage relationships by systematic variation of fretting frequency and area. The results of Open Circuit Potential (OCP) tests, fretting current tests and visualization of fretting showed this device could achieve the basic requirement for triboelectrochemical testing and also provided direct evidence of debris generation during fretting corrosion. The fretting region was surrounded by a halo of fretting debris after removal from the solution. One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the redeposition of fretting product. It was also found that higher fretting frequency and smaller second electrode areas lead to larger and faster voltage drops during abrasion. This is because the smaller area of the second electrode resulted in less surface area for electrons to be reduced. Higher frequency abrasion also resulted in higher film currents and faster electron generation rate which would cause more electrons accumulating at the working electrode."

The VDS is intended to assist collaborating architects, engineers and project management team members throughout from the early phases to the detailed building design stages. It can be used to plan design tasks and workflow, and evaluate the potential impacts of various green building strategies on the building performance by using the state of the art simulation tools as well as industrial/professional standards and guidelines for green building system design.Based on the review and analysis of existing professional practices in building system design, particularly those used in U.S., Germany and UK, a generic process for performance-based building design, construction and operation was proposed. It included Assess, Define, Design, Apply, and Monitoring (ADDAM) stages. The current VDS focused on the first three stages.The VDS considers the building design as a multi-dimensional process involving multiple design teams, design factors, and design stages. The intersection among these three dimensions defines a specific design task in terms of ""who"", ""what"" and ""when"". It also considers building design as a multi-objective process that aims to enhance the five aspects of performance for green building systems: site sustainability, materials and resource efficiency, water utilization efficiency, energy efficiency and impacts to the atmospheric environment, and IEQ. The current VDS development has been limited to the energy efficiency and IEQ performance with particular focus on thermal, air quality and lighting environmental quality because of their strong interaction with the energy performance of buildings.The VDS software framework contains four major functions:1) Design coordination: It enables users to define tasks using the Input-Process-Output flow approach, which specifies the anticipated activities (i.e., the process), required input and output information, and anticipated interactions with other tasks. It also allows task scheduling to define the work flow, and sharing of the design data and information via internet.2) Modeling and simulation: It enables users to perform building simulations to predict the energy consumption and IEQ conditions at any of the design stages by using EnergyPlus and a combined heat, air, moisture and pollutant simulation (CHAMPS) model. A method for co-simulation was developed to allow the use of both models at the same time step for the combined energy and indoor air quality analysis.3) Results visualization: It enables users to display a 3-D geometric design of the building by reading BIM (building information model) file generated by design software such as SketchUp, and the predicted results of heat, air, moisture, pollutant and light distributions in the building.4) Performance evaluation: It enables the users to compare the performance of a proposed building design against a reference building that is defined for the same type of buildings under the same climate condition, and predict the percent of improvements over the minimum requirements specified in ASHRAE Standard 55-2010, 62.1-2010 and 90.1-2010. An approach was developed to estimate the potential impact of a design factor on the whole building performance, and hence can assist the user to identify areas that have most pay back for investment.The VDS software was developed by using C++ with the conventional Model, View and Control (MVC) software architecture. The software has been verified by using a simple 3-zone case building. The application of the VDS concepts and framework for building design and performance analysis has been illustrated by using a medium size five story office building that received the LEED Platinum Certification from USGBC."

Studies toward the regioselective and stereoselective formation these types of bonds using different organometallic methods will be presented. Three focal areas have been studied: C-N bond formation, C-H borylation, and silylvinylation of alkynes.In Chapter 1, palladium-catalyzed amidation has been used to effectively form C-N bonds toward the synthesis of valuable imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines and imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines. The reaction conditions are tolerable for a variety of N-substituted-3-amino-2-chloropyridines. All current routes to expand the substrate scope in regards to substitution on the pyridine ring will be discussed.Chapter 2 will detail a new method for the synthesis of 3,3'-bis-arylated BINOL derivatives through an ortho C-H borylation of commercially available (R)-BINOL followed by an in situ Suzuki-Miyarua coupling. Conventionally, these compounds are made via time-consuming multi-step routes. Development of this new method, which takes a total time of 24 hours with only a single purification step, will be discussed in detail.In Chapter 3, ruthenium hydride-catalyzed silylvinylation of alkynes under an ethylene atmosphere has permitted the facile formation of highly functionalized diene systems. The synthesis of conjugated diene systems has been of great interest due to their prevalent appearance in naturally occurring compounds. Derivatizations of these novel diene systems will be presented, including a rare method for the trans-silylformylation of alkynes."
etd_572,Development of multicomponent coupled-cluster theory and its application to nanoclusters and molecular systems,Chemistry,,"Many theoretical and computational methods are based upon the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This approximation greatly simplifies the search for a wave function that describes all electrons and nuclei in a chemical system. This is accomplished by assuming that the motion of nuclei and electrons are vastly different; the motion of the two particle types is decoupled. While the BO approximation is ubiquitous in computational and theoretical studies, it is not always justifiable. There are two main cases where this approximation is not valid. The first is when nuclear and electronic motion cannot be decoupled. Decoupling the motion leads to incorrect observations and conclusions drawn. The second case is when a chemical system has more than one type of particle to be treated without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For these types of systems, a different and more general interpretation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation must be made where multiple particle types can be investigated whose motion is not decoupled from one another. In order to investigate systems that are classified in this more inclusive interpretation, new computational theories and methods are needed. To accomplish this task, the multicomponent coupled-cluster method has been developed. In its present form, this new computational method is capable of treating two types of particles without de- coupling their motion. The fundamental theories and methods for multicomponent coupled-cluster theory are discussed before the derivation and resulting multicomponent coupled-cluster equations are discussed. This method was then used to study excited electronic states in molecular systems and semiconductor quantum dots via the electron-hole representation. It was also used to calculated ground state energy of the positronium hydride system. These projects sparked further interest in the con- sequences of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation’s application to chemical systems and how it compares to a non Born-Oppenheimer treatment."

This reaction provides quick access to products with substitution at N1 and C2. A model system relevant to the natural product pentosidine has been demonstrated, as well as the total synthesis of the mutagen 1-Me-5-PhIP.This reaction was then further explored to utilize more readily available catalytic components and to increase the substrate and amide scope.Chapter 3The C2 amination of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines was accomplished through C2 halogenation followed by substitution (SNAr) with functionalized primary and secondary amines. This regioselective sequence is operationally simple and provides an easy access to derivatives of protected imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines.Chapter 4Pentosidine, a biologically important advanced glycation endproduct, has been accessed in a rapid, high-yielding manner.

Of particular interest was whether parenting factors moderate the associations between MLBW and indicators of both socioemotional and cognitive/academic competence. Birth weight and prenatal data were taken from medical records. Parenting factors were assessed during in-home assessments at ages 3 and 5. Mothers and teachers reported on externalizing behaviors and teachers reported on social skills at age 9. In addition, cognitive/academic outcomes were assessed using teacher reports and standardized assessments at age 9. Overall, findings suggest that MLBW was significantly associated with teacher reports of children's socioemotional competence as well as cognitive/academic outcomes including receptive vocabulary, reading, and math achievement at age 9. These associations remained significant after accounting for a large battery of control variables; the exception was the link between MLBW status and parent's report of externalizing behavior at age 9. Results also indicated that maternal warmth, but not parenting stress, moderated the longitudinal associations between MLBW and cognitive/academic outcomes and teacher-reported socioemotional competence. To conclude, these results highlight the significance of MLBW and positive parenting processes across diverse child outcomes. The implications of these findings are discussed for interventions targeting MLBW children within at-risk populations."

A total of 42 college students were assigned to either sitting meditation (21) or moving meditation conditions (21) and an additional 39 college students to a comparison group without treatment. Two outcome variables (cognitive trait anxiety and somatic trait anxiety) were measured four times by using on-line self-report questionnaires. It was hypothesized that moving meditation program would be more effective than sitting meditation program for those whose cognitive trait anxiety is dominant over somatic trait anxiety at the baseline and vice versa. The statistical method of Multilevel Modeling (MLM) was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Expected aptitude-treatment interaction was not supported, while significant beneficial effects of overall meditation programs were present. However, post hoc analyses revealed that previous meditation experience was a higher-order moderator differentiating the results. The interaction hypotheses were supported within the non-meditator subgroup, but not within the meditator subgroup. For individuals with previous meditation experience, two meditation programs had no difference in reducing both cognitive and somatic trait anxiety regardless of the baseline measures of both types of anxiety. With regard to the post hoc findings, implications of characteristics of the two meditation programs and attitudinal aspects of meditation practice are discussed."
etd_708,DIRECTED EVOLUTION FOR THE DESIGN OF NEW CATALYSTS,Chemistry,,"Introducing new catalytic function into existing proteins provide ways of understanding the fundamental principles of enzyme catalysis and has gained recognition as a leading tool for understanding protein folding, structure, and function. De novo computational design coupled with directed evolution can yield catalysts with novel functions and improved catalytic rate enhancement of enzymes.1-2Minimalist protein design that focuses on the bare minimum requirements to achieve activity presents several important advantages. By utilizing basic physico-chemical properties and strategic placing of only few highly active residues one can feasibly sample a very large variety of possible catalysts. In more general terms minimalist approach looks for the mere possibility of catalysis, rather than trying to identify the most active catalyst possible. Even very basic designs that utilize a single residue introduced into non-enzymatic proteins or peptide bundles are surprisingly active. No complex calculations need to be set up and even a beginner can master this technique in a very short time. An enzyme nicknamed AlleyCatE is an allosterically regulated catalyst of ester hydrolysis that was generated by introducing a single histidine residue into a non-enzymatic protein calmodulin (CaM). The catalytic efficiency of the resulting enzyme is higher than that of any other rationally designed p-nitrophenylesterase and is on par with some catalytic antibodies."
etd_511,"Disastrous waters, renascent lands: Politics and agrarian transformations in post-disaster Colombia",Geography,"Adaptation, Agrarian change, Colombia, Disasters, Floods, Peasants","In 2010, Colombia experienced one of the most dramatic disasters in its recent history. Catastrophic floods associated with the global intensification of the La Niña phenomenon wreaked havoc on thousands of rural households and agricultural fields. Government institutions framed this disaster as a dramatic manifestation of global climate change. In consequence, these institutions employed adaptation as a form of governance intended to recover and reconstruct the areas affected by the La Niña floods. Through a variety of specific projects, state institutions brought the discourses and practices of adaptation to local rural settings. This dissertation examines the ways in which global climate disasters and state-led adaptation governance are actualized, experienced, and transfigured in the everyday life of rural people in Colombia, and how competing notions of post-disaster agrarian futures are produced and negotiated in the aftermath of catastrophe. This dissertation focuses on four areas of negotiation and debate between government officials and peasants in the aftermath of the catastrophe: a) the material reconstruction of the agrarian landscape and the production of collective memories of the disaster; b) the reconstruction of domestic spaces and the creation of risk zones as the basis for the implementation of a housing project; c) the reconstruction of the agrarian economy and the debates around the imaginaries of a prosperous post-disaster future; and d) the reconstruction of social relations, behaviors, forms of organization and the formation and contestation of particular notions of community. I find that in Colombia adaptation is far from being an ideal path towards resilience in the face of climate change. Rather, the victims of the catastrophe experienced adaptation projects as another form of development intervention involving longstanding contradictions such as exclusion, dispossession, and bureaucratic conflicts."
etd_236,Discovering the Biological Activities of Maltose Derivatives for Controlling Bacterial Multicellular Behaviors,Chemistry,"Bacterial Biofilms, Maltose derivatives, Non-microbicidal approach, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Rhamnolipids","Since the serendipitous discovery of the first antibiotic, the ""wonder drug"" penicillin by Alexander Fleming, bacteria over time have slowly developed resistance to most antibiotics through three well coordinated processes. Firstly, bacteria can evolve their genetic makeup to become resistant against antibiotics; Secondly, bacteria can relay the modified antibiotic resistant genes to other bacteria and other species through a process called conjugation. Thirdly, bacteria quickly give up their individuality to become a part of a team to form surface attached multicellular communities known as biofilms. Bacteria residing within biofilms are protected by a layer of slime which renders the bacteria one thousand fold more resistant to the action of antibiotics. Nearly eighty percent of bacterial infections are associated with biofilms and therefore understandably, biofilms are considered as one of the seven most important health issues facing mankind in the 21st century. The focus of research work presented here is to discover small molecules that can control multiple microbial multicellular behaviors. The fundamental approach was to deploy small molecules that do not kill the bacteria (nonmicrobicidal), but are able to modulate bacterial multicellular behaviors, like biofilm formation and swarming motility, which are not essential for bacterial survival but are critical for infections. Consequently, the use of such nonmicrobicidal agents is less likely to induce evolution of bacterial genes. The use of two different kinds of nonmicrobicidal agents, maltose derivatives and brominated furanones, as modulators of different bacterial multicellular behaviors has been demonstrated. Rhamnolipids secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are biosurfactants that are known to be essential for at least three multicellular behaviors of P. aeruginosa, biofilm formation, biofilm dispersion and swarming motility. Maltose derivatives, which are structurally related torhamnolipids were synthesized and found to be nonmicrobicidal to the growth of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Maltose derivatives were effective at inhibiting the initial adhesion, biofilm formation and at dispersing pre-formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. Maltose derivatives were capable of both modulating the swarming motility of wild type P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and activating swarming of a nonswarming P. aeruginosa mutant, rhlA. Although, the maltose derivatives were able to inhibit the biofilm formation, these agents were not effective at either inhibiting the initial adhesion or dispersing the preformed biofilms of both E. coli and S. aureus. Brominated furanones are known to disrupt bacterial chemical communication process known as quorum sensing (QS). Here the mechanism of action of brominated furanones on both E. coli and P. aeruginosa was explored. The presence of a methyl substituent either on the furanone ring or on the exocylic vinyl bond was identified as an important structural element for maintaining nonmicrobicidal action. The protein SdiA of E. coli was found to be critical for antibiofilm activities of brominated furanones against E. coli. The lasI protein on P. aeruginosa is a known homologue of the E. coli SdiA protein. It was found that the brominated furanones were antagonistic to the las QS system but were agonistic to the rhl QS system of P. aeruginosa. The nonmicrobicidal agents presented here, maltose derivative and brominated furanones offer new approaches for controlling biofilm and bacteria-related problems."

In this work, we first study of the gate sizing problem for today's industrial designs, and explore the contributions and limitations of all the existing approaches, which mainly suffer from producing only continuous solutions, using outdated timing models or experiencing performance inefficiency.In this dissertation, we present our new discrete gate sizing technique which optimizes different aspects of circuit performance, including delay, area and power consumption. And our method is fast and efficient as it applies the local search instead of global exhaustive search during gate size selection process, which greatly reduces the search space and improves the computation complexity. In addition to that, it is also flexible with different timing models, and it is able to deal with the constraints of input/output slew and output load capacitance, under which very few previous research works were reported.We then propose a new timing model, which is derived from the classic Elmore delay model, but takes the features of modern timing models from standard cell library. With our new timing model, we are able to formulate the combinatorial discrete sizing problem as a simplified mathematical expression and apply it to existing Lagrangian relaxation method, which is shown to converge to optimal solution. We demonstrate that the classic Elmore delay model based gate sizing approaches can still be valid. Therefore, our work might provide a new look into the numerous Elmore delay model based research works in various areas (such as placement, routing, layout, buffer insertion, timing analysis, etc.)."
mat_etd_70,Discrete Sparse Fourier Hermite Approximations in High Dimensions,Mathematics,"Fourier Hermite Series, Generalized Fourier Series, Hyperbolic Cross Sparse Index, Multiscale Quadrature, Pseudospectral Approximation, Spectral Approximation","In this dissertation, the discrete sparse Fourier Hermite approximation of a function in a specified Hilbert space of arbitrary dimension is defined, and theoretical error bounds of the numerically computed approximation are proven. Computing the Fourier Hermite approximation in high dimensions suffers from the well-known curse of dimensionality. In short, as the ambient dimension increases, the complexity of the problem grows until it is impossible to numerically compute a solution. To circumvent this difficulty, a sparse, hyperbolic cross shaped set, that takes advantage of the natural decaying nature of the Fourier Hermite coefficients, is used to serve as an index set for the approximation. The Fourier Hermite coefficients must be numerically estimated since they are nearly impossible to compute exactly, except in trivial cases. However, care must be taken to compute them numerically, since the integrals involve oscillatory terms. To closely approximate the integrals that appear in the approximated Fourier Hermite coefficients, a multiscale quadrature method is used. This quadrature method is implemented through an algorithm that takes advantage of the natural properties of the Hermite polynomials for fast results.The definitions of the sparse index set and of the quadrature method used will each introduce many interdependent parameters. These parameters give a user many degrees of freedom to tailor the numerical procedure to meet his or her desired speed and accuracy goals. Default guidelines of how to choose these parameters for a general function f that will significantly reduce the computational cost over any naive computational methods without sacrificing accuracy are presented. Additionally, many numerical examples are included to support the complexity and accuracy claims of the proposed algorithm."

This impacts the MFT educational experiences of students of color.  When students of color are engaged in classrooms, internship experiences, and supervision groups not crafted for their unique experiences with clients as it pertains to race, power dynamics, and other differences highlighted in the therapy room, students are left to decide for themselves how to address these issues in therapy. Furthermore, the lack of literature and discussion in training programs, and the microaggressions that are left unattended and unprocessed may lead to alienation in education and fatigue among persons of color in the field. Surveys were sent to students in MFT graduate programs across the United States and Canada to discern whether and with whom they experienced racial microaggressions in their training programs. The results indicate that many MFT students of color and whites are aware of microaggressions and are impacted by them. Students have opinions about ways to make MFT training programs more inclusive by decreasing microaggression experiences for student therapists."
etd_71,Distributed Estimation and Performance Limits in Resource-constrained Wireless Sensor Networks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Bayesian estimation, Kalman filtering, Particle filtering, Sensor networks, Target tracking","Distributed inference arising in sensor networks has been an interesting and promising discipline in recent years. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate  several issues related to distributed inference in sensor networks,  emphasizing parameter estimation and target tracking with  resource-constrainted networks.To reduce the transmissions between sensors and the fusion center thereby saving bandwidth and energy consumption in sensor networks, a novel methodology, where each local sensor performs a censoring procedure based on the normalized innovation square (NIS),   is proposed for the sequential Bayesian estimation problem in this dissertation. In this methodology, each sensor sends only the informative measurements  and the fusion center fuses both missing measurements and received ones to yield more accurate inference. The new methodology is derived for both linear  and nonlinear dynamic systems, and both scalar and vector measurements. The relationship between the censoring rule based on NIS and the one based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is investigated.A probabilistic transmission model over multiple access channels (MACs)  is investigated.  With this model, a relationship between the sensor management and compressive sensing problems is established, based on which,  the sensor management problem becomes a constrained optimization problem, where the goal is to determine the optimal values of probabilities that each sensor should transmit with such that the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) at any given time step is maximized.  The performance of the proposed compressive sensing based sensor management methodology in terms of accuracy of inference is investigated.For the Bayesian parameter estimation problem, a framework is proposed where quantized observations from local sensors are not directly fused at the fusion center, instead, an additive noise is injected independently to each quantized observation. The injected noise performs as a low-pass filter in the characteristic function (CF) domain, and therefore, is capable of recoverving the original analog data if certain conditions are satisfied. The optimal estimator based on the new framework is derived, so is the performance bound in terms of Fisher information. Moreover, a sub-optimal estimator, namely, linear minimum mean square error estimator (LMMSE) is derived, due to the fact that the proposed framework theoretically justifies the additive noise modeling of the quantization process. The bit allocation problem based on the framework is also investigated.A source localization problem in a large-scale sensor network is explored. The maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator based on the quantized data from local sensors and its performance bound in terms of Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are derived. Since the number of sensors is large, the law of large numbers (LLN) is utilized to obtain a closed-form version of the performance bound, which clearly shows the dependence of the bound on the sensor density, $i.e.,$ the Fisher information is a linearly increasing function of the sensor density. Error incurred by the LLN approximation is also theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, the design of sub-optimal local sensor quantizers based on the closed-form solution is proposed.The problem of on-line performance evaluation for state estimation of a moving target is studied. In particular, a compact and efficient  recursive conditional  Posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) is proposed. This bound provides theoretical justification for a heuristic one proposed by other researchers in this area. Theoretical complexity analysis is provided to show the efficiency of the proposed bound, compared to the existing bound."
etd_629,Distributed Inference and Learning with Byzantine Data,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Byzantines, Corrupted Data, Distributed Inference, Distributed Learning","We are living in an increasingly networked world with sensing networks of varying shapes and sizes: the network often comprises of several tiny devices (or nodes) communicating with each other via different topologies. To make the problem even more complicated, the nodes in the network can be unreliable due to a variety of reasons: noise, faults and attacks, thus, providingcorrupted data. Although the area of statistical inference has been an active area of research in thepast, distributed learning and inference in a networked setup with potentially unreliable componentshas only gained attention recently. The emergence of big and dirty data era demands newdistributed learning and inference solutions to tackle the problem of inference with corrupted data.Distributed inference networks (DINs) consist of a group of networked entities which acquireobservations regarding a phenomenon of interest (POI), collaborate with other entities in the networkby sharing their inference via different topologies to make a global inference. The centralgoal of this thesis is to analyze the effect of corrupted (or falsified) data on the inference performanceof DINs and design robust strategies to ensure reliable overall performance for severalpractical network architectures. Specifically, the inference (or learning) process can be that of detectionor estimation or classification, and the topology of the system can be parallel, hierarchicalor fully decentralized (peer to peer).Note that, the corrupted data model may seem similar to the scenario where local decisionsare transmitted over a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with a certain cross over probability,however, there are fundamental differences. Over the last three decades, research communityhas extensively studied the impact of transmission channels or faults on the distributed detectionsystem and related problems due to its importance in several applications. However, corrupted(Byzantine) data models considered in this thesis, are philosophically different from the BSC orthe faulty sensor cases. Byzantines are intentional and intelligent, therefore, they can optimizeover the data corruption parameters. Thus, in contrast to channel aware detection, both the FC andthe Byzantines can optimize their utility by choosing their actions based on the knowledge of theiropponent’s behavior. Study of these practically motivated scenarios in the presence of Byzantinesis of utmost importance, and is missing from the channel aware detection and fault tolerant detectionliterature. This thesis advances the distributed inference literature by providing fundamentallimits of distributed inference with Byzantine data and provides optimal counter-measures (usingthe insights provided by these fundamental limits) from a network designer’s perspective. Notethat, the analysis of problems related to strategical interaction between Byzantines and networkdesigned is very challenging (NP-hard is many cases). However, we show that by utilizing theproperties of the network architecture, efficient solutions can be obtained. Specifically, we foundthat several problems related to the design of optimal counter-measures in the inference contextare, in fact, special cases of these NP-hard problems which can be solved in polynomial time.First, we consider the problem of distributed Bayesian detection in the presence of data falsification(or Byzantine) attacks in the parallel topology. Byzantines considered in this thesis are thosenodes that are compromised and reprogrammed by an adversary to transmit false information toa centralized fusion center (FC) to degrade detection performance. We show that above a certainfraction of Byzantine attackers in the network, the detection scheme becomes completely incapable(or blind) of utilizing the sensor data for detection. When the fraction of Byzantines is notsufficient to blind the FC, we also provide closed form expressions for the optimal attacking strategiesfor the Byzantines that most degrade the detection performance. Optimal attacking strategiesin certain cases have the minimax property and, therefore, the knowledge of these strategies haspractical significance and can be used to implement a robust detector at the FC.In several practical situations, parallel topology cannot be implemented due to limiting factors,such as, the FC being outside the communication range of the nodes and limited energy budget ofthe nodes. In such scenarios, a multi-hop network is employed, where nodes are organized hierarchicallyinto multiple levels (tree networks). Next, we study the problem of distributed inferencein tree topologies in the presence of Byzantines under several practical scenarios. We analyticallycharacterize the effect of Byzantines on the inference performance of the system. We also look atthe possible counter-measures from the FC’s perspective to protect the network from these Byzantines.These counter-measures are of two kinds: Byzantine identification schemes and Byzantinetolerant schemes. Using learning based techniques, Byzantine identification schemes are designedthat learn the identity of Byzantines in the network and use this information to improve systemperformance. For scenarios where this is not possible, Byzantine tolerant schemes, which usegame theory and error-correcting codes, are developed that tolerate the effect of Byzantines whilemaintaining a reasonably good inference performance in the network.Going a step further, we also consider scenarios where a centralized FC is not available. Insuch scenarios, a solution is to employ detection approaches which are based on fully distributedconsensus algorithms, where all of the nodes exchange information only with their neighbors. Forsuch networks, we analytically characterize the negative effect of Byzantines on the steady-stateand transient detection performance of conventional consensus-based detection schemes. To avoidperformance deterioration, we propose a distributed weighted average consensus algorithm that isrobust to Byzantine attacks. Next, we exploit the statistical distribution of the nodes’ data to devisetechniques for mitigating the influence of data falsifying Byzantines on the distributed detectionsystem. Since some parameters of the statistical distribution of the nodes’ data might not be knowna priori, we propose learning based techniques to enable an adaptive design of the local fusion orupdate rules.The above considerations highlight the negative effect of the corrupted data on the inferenceperformance. However, it is possible for a system designer to utilize the corrupted data for network’sbenefit. Finally, we consider the problem of detecting a high dimensional signal based oncompressed measurements with secrecy guarantees. We consider a scenario where the networkoperates in the presence of an eavesdropper who wants to discover the state of the nature beingmonitored by the system. To keep the data secret from the eavesdropper, we propose to use cooperatingtrustworthy nodes that assist the FC by injecting corrupted data in the system to deceive theeavesdropper. We also design the system by determining the optimal values of parameters whichmaximize the detection performance at the FC while ensuring perfect secrecy at the eavesdropper."
etd_636,Divergence or Convergence of Home and School Ethnic-Racial Socialization: Effects on Preschool Children's Self-Regulation,Child and Family Studies,"Early Childhood Education, Ethnic-Racial Socialization, Multicultural","As the population in the United States continues to become more diverse, early childhood programs serving our nation’s youngest citizens strive to meet the needs of families from different cultural backgrounds. Despite the established importance of ethnic-racial socialization in the early social and cognitive development of young children, parents and teachers seldom discuss issues related to race and ethnicity with preschool children. Using propositions within the bioecological and developmental niche models, critical race theory, and frameworks that focus on the socialization of children from diverse ethnic-racial backgrounds, the current study examined differences between parents’ and teachers’ use of ethnic-racial socialization and links between match or mismatch and children’s self-regulation. The sample consisted of 63 three- to five-year-old children from diverse ethnic-racial backgrounds, their primary caregivers, and their Head Start teachers, all residing in a mid-sized city in Upstate New York. Results indicate that parents use ethnic-racialization more than teachers, both home and early childhood environments had similar numbers of cultural items, and parents and teachers used egalitarian messages the most compared to other modes of socialization. Bayesian analyses revealed significant ethnic-racial group differences in the utilization of preparation for bias and cultural socialization messages. African American parents used preparation for bias and cultural socialization at higher rates than parents of European American children and those in the combined ethnic group. Match in caregivers’ and teachers’ use of egalitarian messages was associated with higher self-regulation. A greater difference between ethnic-racial socialization in home and school physical environments was also surprisingly linked to higher self-regulation scores. Findings highlight the importance of ethnic-racial socialization in Head Start children’s early social development and may be useful in informing early childhood practices relating to cultural continuity."

The primary aim of this research is to examine the factors that predict performance in public management networks by disentangling the idea that collaboration requires both diversity and unity. Drawing upon diversity theories, social capital theory and management literature as theoretical lenses, this dissertation serves to investigate the following questions:1. What is the collaborative decision-making process in inter-organizational networks?2. How does social capital mediate the relationship between network member diversity and performance?3. How does network management strategy moderate the relationship between social capital and network performance?My dissertation answers these questions by examining Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in the United States, one of the regional transportation networks. MPOs are formal inter-organizational networks that go beyond informal and intra-organizational networks. The focus here is on collaborative decision-making activities by individuals (mostly top-level administrators) who represent organizations working across their boundaries. This dissertation provides an important evidence of the interactive effects between network management behaviors and structural properties of networks on performance; it also contributes to the existing knowledge of inter-organizational dynamics in transportation planning networks."

They are biocompatible, their surface can be easily modified with ligands, and they are readily taken up by cells. In this work, DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were developed as delivery vehicles for the clinically used anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and actinomycin D (ActD). Each vehicle contains a tailorable number of DNA duplexes (typically ~60), each possessing three high-affinity sequences for intercalation. Drug binding was evaluated by measuring changes to DNA melting temperature (Tm), particle hydrodynamic diameter (Dh), and AuNP surface plasmon resonance wavelength (ëspr) as a function of drug loading. These studies demonstrated that DOX intercalates at its high-affinity sequence bound at the AuNP, and that ActD exhibits relatively weaker binding to its preferred sequence. The binding constant (K) and drug dissociation rate constant (â) were shown to be enhanced in DOX-vehicle binding compared to DOX-calf thymus binding, but no such effect was noted in the ActD system. Cytotoxicity toward neuroblastoma cells was similar for each vehicle compared to the corresponding free drug, DOX or ActD.A second generation of vehicles was developed to overcome potential limitations of the initial design. First, the vehicle was functionalized with folic acid (FA) to enable cancer cell targeting and to enhance cytotoxicity. FA-modified vehicles were synthesized and extensively characterized. A second modification to the vehicle involved functionalization with a temperature-responsive pNIPAAm-co-pAAm polymer (p) to improve the kinetic and equilibrium properties of drug release. By sterically impeding the release of drug from surface bound DNA at physiological temperature, the K doubled for the p-modified vehicle. The vehicle was also functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enable evasion of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Confocal microscopy studies showed moderate DOX uptake for the first generation vehicle, with little DOX located in the nucleus. In contrast, DOX uptake was significantly enhanced for vehicles modified with FA, p, and both. Neuroblastoma cell culture studies showed ~5-fold enhanced cytotoxicity for the p-modified vehicle relative to DOX, presumably due to an increase in K. Cytotoxicity was enhanced ~1.2-fold for vehicles with low to moderate FA loading, demonstrating that there may be an optimal FA loading to achieve targeting. PEG functionalization did not affect cell growth. Finally, the cytotoxicity of vehicles co-functionalized with both FA and p was enhanced ~10-fold, making it the most cytotoxic vehicle investigated.In another class of studies, the gravitational sedimentation of citrate- and ascorbate-capped spherical AuNP was investigated by measuring the absorption-vs.-time trend produced as the particles slowly sediment. For comparison, theoretical sedimentation curves were generated using the Mason-Weaver sedimentation-diffusion equation. This was done by solving the equation for various particle diameters and weighting the solution with the TEM histogram and the size-dependent extinction coefficients. For particles having average AuNP core diameters of 12.1 ± 0.6, 65.0 ± 5.2, and 82.5 ± 5.2 nm, very good agreement existed between the theoretical and observed sedimentation curves. Size histograms were also generated based on the measured sedimentation data."
etd_660,DNA-Mediated Nanoparticle Clustering: Exploring the Role of Size Ratio and DNA Hybridization Energy,Chemistry,,"Understanding the fundamental principles behind biomemetic nanoparticle self- assembly has been under intense focus in chemistry, physics and materials science for fabrication of discrete 3-D structures. One route includes the use of DNA-mediated interactions between nanomaterial interfaces. Nanomaterials such as quantum dots, quantum rods and metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be encoded by DNA sequences and used to assemble a variety of nano-sized architectures. This work, presents a detailed study between DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to produce discrete nanoparticle clusters. AuNPs of 5-50 nm were assembled after manipulating interparticle energetics by changing DNA coverage, length, rigidity and sequence as well as nanoparticle size. Implementation of a ssDNA linker changed the hybridization energy and allowed for tunability in self-assembly kinetics. The work demonstrates that controllable cluster assembly is achievable with a 6 base DNA linker and a decreased assembly temperature. Discrete clustering was observed, revealing assemblies of different size, shape and morphology. Isolation of these AuNP clusters was investigated through the use of gradient ultracentrifugation. Finally, cluster control was extended by utilizing thermoresponsive polymers (p) in addition to DNA, to modify NPs of various morphologies (AuNPs, AuNCs and Au-Pd/Pd). The regulation behavior of the p was considered in light of both the thermal denaturation temperature of DNA and the critical temperature of p, allowing a narrow window for assembly to occur and providing insights into a smart self-assembly system."

Yet, research has failed to yield consistent evidence for psychological mechanisms of relationships between social support and health outcomes. Explanations for these failures include limitations of research design and statistical analysis, inadequate theory-building, and a failure to investigate implicit psychological processes that operate during normal everyday social interactions. The present study utilized a promising theoretical framework (i.e., social action theory) to evaluate implicit mechanisms within a naturalistic observation study design using multilevel modeling. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the role of between-person differences in agonistic motives and perceived social support in predicting within-person processes of interpersonal stress and cardiovascular responding. Results indicated that interpersonal stress was associated with higher ambulatory SBP. The dissipated group had the highest DBP, and was also more obese compared to the other groups. Results indicated that perceived social support attenuated the effect of interpersonal stress on SBP. Results did not support the notion that motives moderate the relationships between perceived social support, interpersonal stress, and ambulatory blood pressure. These results suggest a potential new disease pathway for cardiovascular disease risk, and provide support for the role of perceived social support as an implicit regulatory mechanism which lowers cardiovascular activity in interpersonally stressful contexts."

An emerging stream of disclosure literature assumes that the relationship between corporate governance and misstatement disclosure choices mirror that found in prior voluntary disclosure literature though no study has empirically demonstrated that a similar relationship exists. Using a sample of 302 accounting irregularities disclosed between 2000 and 2006, I investigate the role of corporate governance, including both internal and external mechanisms, in influencing misstatement disclosure timeliness. I provide empirical evidence consistent with the value of in-the-money stock options incentivizing management to disclose material misstatements in a less timely manner and a non-linear relationship between management ownership and timeliness where lower levels of ownership improve timeliness and higher levels of ownership inhibit timeliness. The results also suggest that greater board independence, CFO turnover prior to the end of the misstated period, and greater risk of civil litigation improve misstatement disclosure timeliness, while greater board size and board classification have the opposite effect."
etd_146,Does Credit Rating Matter in Audit Fee Determination? A Comprehensive Analysis,Accounting,"Audit Fee, Credit Rating, Credit Rating Change, Financial Crisis, Sarbanes-Oxley Act","Using a large sample of observations between 2001 and 2011, this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between credit ratings and audit fees. The findings of this study show that companies with lower credit ratings are associated with higher audit fees. Credit downgrades are associated with audit fee increases while credit upgrades have no explicit effect on audit fees. In addition, the relationship between rating changes and audit fees is non-linear. Companies that experienced credit rating changes from investment grades to speculative grades are associated with even higher audit fees relative to other rating changes within investment grades or within speculative grades. When investigating the influence of out/within-broad credit rating changes, this study finds that audit firms charge higher fees for out-broad rating changes compared to within-broad rating changes. Further, auditors place more weight on credit ratings after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act while placing less weight on credit ratings after the financial crisis, which is likely due to the criticism of credit rating agencies for their role in the financial crisis."

The Relationship Between A Country's Political Context And Its Rulers,Political Science,"Comparative politics, Large n, Leadership analysis, Leadership Trait Analysis (LTA), Political context, Political leaders","Of interest in this research is the relationship between a country's political context and its leader-its chief executive. The question being investigated is: Who rules in what political context? The premise is that in certain political environments, some skills are required (or at least highly desirable) to be elected or selected and to govern, where others are quickly rebuked. The mechanism theorized to govern the relationship between the political context and the type of leader in charge is the 'degree of constraint.' Components of the political context impose a certain degree of constraint on the leader, which is hypothesized to have an impact on specific leadership qualities that fit best in that situation.This research project is a large n study of the relationship between a country's political context and its leaders. For the period from 1998 through 2008, psychological profiles are constructed for political leaders from four regions in the world (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia), resulting in a dataset with leadership profiles of 247 leaders from 89 countries, for a total sum of 356 observations, or leadership regimes. Information is also collected on the political context of each country: its political system, leadership and electoral structures, processes and outcomes. Using the concept of 'degree of constraint' as the intervening variable, a correlational analysis is done to ascertain the ways in which a country's political context and leadership are related.This study purports to contribute to the scholarship in two major ways, one substantive and one methodological. First: to enhance our understanding of the way in which a country's political context and leaders are related. And second: to demonstrate the feasibility of doing large n leadership studies, and offer a first template of how a large dataset with leadership profiles can be constructed and used in conjunction with other datasets available to investigate research questions."
busad_etd_96,Does Regulatory Scrutiny Change Investment Behavior? Evidence of Suboptimal Portfolio Rebalancing After the Financial Crisis,Business Administration,"Insurance, Regulation, Statutory Accounting Principles, Tax-free and Taxable Securities","Insurers that show losses are expected to sell tax-free securities and replace them with taxable securities since they can no longer benefit from tax savings. However, rebalancing these portfolios after the financial crisis would entail recognizing additional losses during a time period when their financial performance was under stress and their industry was under increased scrutiny. I examine portfolio rebalancing behavior using the period after the financial crisis as a proxy for increased regulatory scrutiny. I predict and find that insurers with losses subsequent to the financial crisis were less likely to increase their ratio of taxable/nontaxable securities. Insurers may also face increased regulatory scrutiny due to their own actions which I measure as whether an insurer is in regulatory violation. I further find that insurers that are in regulatory violation (using IRIS ratios) during the financial crisis are less likely to increase their ratio of taxable/nontaxable securities."
etd_140,Domestic Instability and Legislative Development:  Understanding the Sources of Parliamentary Weakness in Jordan,Political Science,"Authoritarianism, Instability, Jordan, Legislatures","When faced with threats to its rule, Jordan's Hashemite monarchy has attempted to ""weather the storm"" by utilizing survival strategies that involve the kingdom's legislature. Yet these strategies take various forms. Some aim to restrict the role of Jordan's legislature, while others enhance the power of this institution. What explains this variation, and why has the monarchy employed different strategies in response to different threats? This dissertation argues that the specific nature of the regime's legislative survival strategy has depended on the nature of the threat that it faces. Threats that originate among the regime's allies and support base result in institutional concessions that strengthen the role of the country's legislature in an attempt to co-opt those constituencies on which the regime depends the most. By contrast, instability that originates among the regime's opposition prompts efforts to restrict representative institutions, thus minimizing the influence of the regime's most vocal opponents. This dissertation explores the survival strategies that Jordan's ruling regime employed during four periods of instability: its confrontation with radical political parties in the 1950s, the 1970 civil war, the 1989 IMF riots, and the 1991 Gulf Crisis. Far from being short term fixes, moreover, the survival strategies that the regime utilizes have had lasting effects on legislative politics in Jordan. This project thus argues that the weakness of Jordan's parliament today has resulted from the legacies of the various periods of political instability that have occurred throughout the country's history."

Much of the recent research on transnationalism has focused on the ties immigrants maintain in the sending country. This dissertation adds to this analysis by looking at how the actions of Ethiopian immigrants contribute to nation building in the United States as well as in Ethiopia. The double engagements of Ethiopians challenge either/or views of immigrants and demonstrates how transnationality works in both directions.My research, based on 12 months of fieldwork in the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., used participant observation, interviews, life histories and extended conversations to provide the first comprehensive study of first- and second-generation Ethiopian migrants using the transnational perspective. I explore the factors that motivate migrants to maintain transnational connections. I argue that for first-generation immigrants, the conditions of exit greatly shape the types and nature of transnational engagements as much as the receiving-country contexts. In addition, Ethiopian immigrants arrived in three distinct generational units, each of which had starkly differing experiences in Ethiopia and in the United States. These experiences have influenced their priorities regarding adaptation and transnational connections. Largely as the consequence of incongruent pre-immigration experiences, some Ethiopians are heavily involved in political transnationalism while others favor philanthropic giving.I also analyze the transnational activities of second-generation Ethiopians, which include visiting the ancestral land, sponsoring children in the homeland, working for philanthropic NGOs in Ethiopia, shaping definitions of Ethiopian Americans, defending the homeland in the United States, and taking part in political action, especially the hard work of building a voting bloc. Both the diverse generational units of the first- and second-generation Ethiopian immigrants grapple with politics, family loyalty, nationalism, obligations to those left behind, differing views of success, racial views, and many more transnational ties, all the while gauging how far to integrate into U.S. society."

The electric properties and mechanism for fabrication of high efficiency solar cells are still not well established. In this thesis, I’ll report electron and hole drift mobilities measurements in thin film CdTe solar cells based on two characterization methods: time-of-flight and photocapacitance. For a deposition process similar to that used for high-efficiency cells, the electron drift mobilities are in the range 10^-1 – 10^0 cm^2/Vs, and holes are in the range 10^0 – 10^1 cm^2/Vs. The electron drift mobilities are three orders of magnitude smaller than those measured in single crystal CdTe, the hole mobilities are about ten times smaller. Cells were examined before and after a vapor phase treatment with CdCl2; treatment had little effect on the hole drift mobility, but decreased the electron mobility. The electron mobility shows an interesting inverse correlation with the open-circuit voltage for the CdTe coupons with and without the CdCl2 treatment. We speculate that this correlation is due to the diffusion limited recombination. We also discuss the mechanisms reducing the mobilities from the single crystal values. In this thesis, we are able to exclude bandtail trapping and dispersion as a mechanism for the small drift mobilities in thin film CdTe. Other mechanisms like classic scattering, grain boundaries effect, and also polaron interaction will also be discussed in this thesis. All mechanisms mentioned above show little evidence on the influence to the mobility value. The true reason for such a huge change of the drift mobility from its single crystal values still need more interpretations."
etd_49,Drivers of Change:  Explaining IMF Low Income Country Reform in the Post Washington Consensus,Political Science,"Constructivism, Historical Structural Theory, IMF, Post Washington Consensus, Principal Agent Models, Reform","Through use of rationalist, constructivist, and historical structural theory, this study of IMF Low Income Country (LIC) policy change from 1996 to 2010 identifies potential causal variables and mechanisms that drive contemporary reform in the institution toward its poorest member states. Patterns uncovered through principal-agent analysis suggest that coalition formation between at least two actors is a necessary condition for LIC policy reform. Principal-agent analysis also establishes that discontinuity among powerful states gives IMF management and staff greater openings to initiate or block reform efforts. Constructivist analysis assesses if shifts in thinking among IMF insiders and the broader epistemic community of development economists have causal effect on LIC policy reform. Evidence gathered through process tracing methods shows that reform occurred after economic ideas that underwrote previous policy positions lost legitimacy among influential elites within and outside the IMF. Thus while IMF staff self -identify as rational technocrats, they are also driven by concerns of pursuing what the broader elite community deems as appropriate policy choices. When the boundaries of appropriateness change, we can expect reforms that are consistent with new frames of acceptable policy choices to emerge.Stepping outside of mainstream IR theory, historical structural analysis of IMF reform focuses on the interrelation of contemporary capitalist crisis, hegemony, and ""inclusive neoliberal"" development models. Here, the IMF is understood to hold a central role in the creation and perpetuation of the current geopolitical order underwritten by globalizing capitalism. Recent IMF LIC reforms that champion more participation, flexibility, and a nod toward Keynesian practices thus are seen as one component of a broader political project pushed by global elites to undermine potential challenges to the contemporary world order. Evidence gathered through discourse analysis and interviews shows that IMF staff and management were cognizant of growing resistance to Washington Consensus reforms and embraced less coercive and more participatory means to increase LIC buy in into concessionary lending programs. The scope and character of contemporary IMF reforms paralleled similar calls for rethinking how to `do' development among global elites. This suggests that a component of IMF policy response in LICs is tied to a broader political project focused on building a more inclusive and hegemonic form of globalizing capitalism.The juxtaposition of three theoretical frameworks to examine the same phenomenon also provides a platform to evaluate current IR theory focused on IMF reform. Rationalist and positivist oriented constructivist approaches provide clear analytical roadmaps to cut through the complex dynamics found in the IMF, identify potential causal variables and mechanisms, and develop testable predictive hypotheses related to institutional reform. However, if studies of IMF LIC reform rely solely on current mainstream frameworks, explanation and analysis of how Fund policy change is interrelated with shifts and tensions in capitalist social structures and the power relations therein remain unexamined. This proves particularly critical when exploring why certain ideas considered market distorting remained off limits in contemporary IMF debates and how post Washington Consensus reforms reflect attempts by global elites to manage crisis points in the contemporary historical structure. In conclusion, I assess the merits of IMF research open to the use of positivist and historical relational paradigms. Such an approach will not produce one correct answer and suffers at some level from divergent baseline understandings of the social world. However, I maintain that despite this tension, the complexity of that world and processes of change within it merit space for mainstream and critical ontologies. Future studies of the IMF should explore more fully how diverse paths of inquiry can be effectively used to explain policy reform.."
etd_583,DRUG-SPECIFIC DESIGN OF TELODENDRIMER ARCHITECTURE FOR EFFECTIVE DRUG ENCAPSULATION,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"chemotherapeutics, cytotoxic protein, drug design, molecular dynamics, nanocarrier","Efficient delivery of different drugs is a major challenge for the design of novel anticancer therapeutics because of factors such as poor drug loading capacity, ineffective shielding of the drug in the core, size distribution, and lack of desired physicochemical properties. A promising solution is for the drug delivery system to utilize polymeric micelles that can encapsulate anticancer drugs in their cores and form stable self-assembled nanocarriers. Theoretical investigations of these systems can provide insights into the chemical interactions that contribute to nanocarrier stability. However, simulations of the nanocarriers are challenging because of the computational limitations associated with the system size. In this work, multiscale computational approach was used in conjunction with collaborative laboratory experiments to analyze the role of the individual building blocks in the self-assembly of a telodendrimer, a highly tunable copolymer. The multiscale approach involves performing molecular dynamics simulations of the self-assembly of telodendrimers and approved anticancer drugs to capture micelle formation and drug encapsulation; this step is followed by reverse mapping to atomistic representation for structural analysis. First, I investigated the tunablility of the telodendrimer platform to deliver the chemotherapeutic drugs paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin (DOX). The computational results were in good agreement with experimental data and showed how subtle changes in the molecular architecture of the telodendrimer’s head groups have profound effects on the nanocarrier size, morphology, and asphericity. Since cytotoxic proteins can perform more efficiently in anticancer drug delivery, using this multiscale computational approach, I next investigated the performance of another generation of telodendrimer family to deliver a cytotoxic protein, truncated diphtheria toxin (DT390) to destroy malignant cancer cells in the brain. This study described how different arrangements of this tunable telodendrimer’s building blocks change encapsulation of DT390, drug loading ratios, size distribution, biocompatibility, and stability. This work emphasizes the potential role of molecular simulations to the rational design of nanocarriers, thereby eliminating the trial and error approaches that have been prevalent in experimental synthesis. The molecular-level insights gained from these simulations will be used to design the next generation of drug-specific nanocarriers."

WORKERS,Economics,"Consumer Amenity, Immigrants, Job Colocation, Labor Markets, Marriage Markets, Ph.D. Workers","This dissertation comprises two papers that examine the employment outcomes and location choices of Ph.D.-trained individuals that often face dual-thin marriage and labor markets. The first paper investigates the degree to which single Ph.D.-trained workers, both domestic and foreign-born, face trade-offs between marriage and labor market opportunities. When job markets are not geographically overlapping with marriage markets, single PhDs may be forced to choose between metropolitan areas (MSAs) that offer better employment opportunities versus better marriage markets. I find significant evidence of a “sorting” effect – the local marriage market is a location-specific consumer amenity for which highly trained foreign-born singles may sacrifice real wage in equilibrium to access a more active dating environment. The second paper uses differencing strategies to compare the location choices of foreign-born versus domestic-born Ph.D.-trained workers. Results suggest that single foreign-born Ph.D. workers are partly willing to forgo the greater labor market opportunities found in large MSAs in exchange for a more active dating scene. In contrast, findings on married foreign-born Ph.D. workers echo those from Costa and Kahn (2000) that highly educated couples are disproportionately drawn to large MSAs in order to solve their job market co-location challenge."

Utilizing the obtained DGFs, the radiation problems of a Hertzian dipole and a microstrip antenna in the presence of an anisotropic substrate are solved.After a brief introduction, the eigenvector dyadic Green?s functions (E-DGFs) for an unbounded general anisotropic medium through the eigen-decomposition method are derived. The E-DGFs of a layered anisotropic geometry are then constructed based on the derivation of the unbounded E-DGFs using two different approaches. One is through the symmetrical property of the DGFs and the other is through the direct construction method. Rigorous proof and detailed derivation of the formulation for the E-DGFs are presented. The usage and limitation of each approach as well as the relationships between the corresponding E-DGFs are discussed.Applying the method of stationary phase to the associated E-DGFs, we formulate the radiation fields of an arbitrarily oriented Hertzian dipole located either above or inside the layered anisotropic medium. The important new findings include the analysis of the radiation field in terms of the reflection coefficients as a function of incidence angle, and the use of the biasing magnetic field to improve the broadside directivity for a z-directed source when a gyroelectric medium is involved.In addition to solving the radiation of a Hertzian dipole in the presence of a layered anisotropic medium, the layered E-DGFs derived here are also utilized to solve the more practical problem of a microstrip dipole printed on an anisotropic substrate. A method ofmoment solution is formulated with the E-DGF in the spectral domain. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method applicable to a general anisotropic medium, the current distribution, input impedances, and radiation patterns are numerically calculated for a microstrip dipole printed on various anisotropic substrates. Furthermore, a detailed parametric study of the effect of frequency, and direction and magnitude of the biasing magnetic field is provided for a dipole printed on a gyroelectric substrate. The parametric analysis in this dissertation may lead to a method whereby the additional freedom introduced by the gyroelectric medium can be utilized effectively to adjust the resonant length and radiation pattern of a printed dipole antenna."

Dynamic thermal management techniques are designed to tackle the problems and control the chip temperature as well as power consumption. They refer to those techniques which enable the chip to autonomously modify the task execution and power dissipation characteristics so that lower-cost cooling solutions could be adopted while still guaranteeing safe temperature regulation. As long as the temperature is regulated, the system reliability can be improved, leakage power can be reduced and cooling system lifetime can be extended significantly.Multimedia applications are expected to form the largest portion of workload in general purpose PC and portable devices. The ever-increasing computation intensity of multimedia applications elevates the processor temperature and consequently impairs the reliability and performance of the system. In this thesis, we propose to perform dynamic thermal management using reinforcement learning algorithm for multimedia applications. The presented learning model does not need any prior knowledge of the workload information or the system thermal and power characteristics. It learns the temperature change and workload switching patterns by observing the temperature sensor and event counters on the processor, and finds the management policy that provides good performance-thermal tradeoff during the runtime.As the system complexity increases, it is more and more difficult to perform thermal management in a centralized manner because of state explosion and the overhead of monitoring the entire chip. In this thesis, we present a framework for distributed thermal management in many-core systems where balanced thermal profile can be achieved by proactive task migration among neighboring cores. The framework has a low cost agent residing in each core that observes the local workload and temperature and communicates with its nearest neighbor for task migration and exchange. By choosing only those migration requests that will result in balanced workload without generating thermal emergency, the presented framework maintains workload balance across the system and avoids unnecessary migration. Experimental results show that, our distributed management policy achieves almost the same performance as a global management policy when the tasks are initially randomly distributed. Compared with existing proactive task migration technique, our approach generates less hotspot, less migration overhead with negligible performance overhead.Temperature affects the leakage power and cooling power. In this thesis, we address the impact of task allocation on a processor's leakage power and cooling fan power. Although the leakage power is determined by the average die temperature and the fan power is determined by the peak temperature, our analysis shows that the overall power can be minimized if a task allocation with minimum peak temperature is adopted together with an intelligent fan speed adjustment technique that finds the optimal tradeoff between fan power and leakage power. We further present a multi-agent distributed task migration technique that searches for the best task allocation during runtime. By choosing only those migration requests that will result chip maximum temperature reduction, the presented framework achieves large fan power savings as well as overall power reduction."

Performance for these applications depends mainly on latency of interconnects which transfer data between cores that implement applications by distributing tasks. Time-to-market is a critical consideration while designing ASICs for these applications. Therefore, to reduce design cycle time, predicting system performance accurately at an early stage of design is essential. With process technology in nanometer era, physical phenomena such as crosstalk, reflection on the propagating signal have a direct impact on performance. Incorporating these effects provides a better performance estimate at an early stage. This work presents a methodology for better performance prediction at an early stage of design, achieved by mapping system specification to a circuit-level netlist description.At system-level, to simplify description and for efficient simulation, SystemVerilog descriptions are employed. For modeling system performance at this abstraction, queueing theory based bounded queue models are applied. At the circuit level, behavioral Input/Output Buffer Information Specification (IBIS) models can be used for analyzing effects of these physical phenomena on on-chip signal integrity and hence performance.For behavioral circuit-level performance simulation with IBIS models, a netlist must be described consisting of interacting cores and a communication link. Two new netlists, IBIS-ISS and IBIS-AMI-ISS are introduced for this purpose. The cores are represented by a macromodel automatically generated by a developed tool from IBIS models. The generated IBIS models are employed in the new netlists. Early performance prediction methodology maps a system specification to an instance of these netlists to provide a better performance estimate at an early stage of design. The methodology is scalable in nanometer process technology and can be reused in different designs."

In particular, observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation supports the idea for an early phase of accelerated expansion called inflation. While the simplest inflationary models provide a consistent theoretical framework in explaining observational data, we are yet to understand the microscopicdetails of the inflationary dynamics, the process of how the inflation ends and how the evolution in the post-inflationary era proceeds. In this dissertation, we will explore observational consequences of well-motivated scenarios in the early universe both from a top-down and bottom-up perspective. In particular, motivated by the null results of low energy searches of Supersymmetry at Large Hadron Collider, we will first focus on the so-called Split Supersymmetry scenarios including a stable dark matter candidate and study observational signatures/constraints of (on) these models. Next, we investigate the phenomenology of particle production events during inflation focusing on cases that are well motivated both by UV physics and bottom-up EFT considerations. Considering thecosmological correlators in the presence of particle production, we explore the viability of scenarios in light of recent data on the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. Finally, we take some small steps towards understanding the dynamics at the end of inflation from an Effective Field Theory perspective and discuss a possible observational effects that might arise in this formalism."
etd_566,E-Commerce and Income Shifting to Dot-sized Tax Havens,Accounting,,"I investigate the extent to which E-commerce facilitates the tax avoidance (or evasion, per the (OECD) of multinational corporations’ shifting income into dot-sized foreign tax havens. E-commerce exacerbating such tax avoidance has long been a widespread concern. Recent OECD, 2015, position papers extensively discuss this problem and provide a series of recommendations for addressing it. However, there are few empirical research papers on E-commerce and tax avoidance, and the specific effect of E-commerce on income shifting has not been examined. I find evidence that firms concentrating their foreign operations in dot-sized tax havens shift greater amounts of income out of U.S. and that the growth of the digital economy strongly increased this effect, consistent with OECD concerns. Similarly, the effect of E-commerce on multinational corporations’ income shifting to tax havens is exacerbated by the level of their profitability and the intensity of their investment in intangible assets. Though I document a specific, important, result with U.S. firms’ data, there is every reason to think that what I find is not unique to the U.S., but general to all jurisdictions.My paper contributes to the literature by identifying this effect and measuring the magnitude of it on U.S. multinational firms’ U.S. and foreign reported incomes. I also contribute to the literature by developing a new, less ambiguous measure of firms’ abilities and tax incentives to shift income based on the numbers of tax haven subsidiaries they incorporate."
etd_39,"Edgeware Security Risk Management: A Three Essay Thesis on Cloud, Virtualization and Wireless Grid Vulnerabilities",Information Management and Technology,"Cloud Computing, Edgeware, Information Security, Virtualization, Wireless Cloud, Wireless Grids","This thesis identifies three essays which contribute to the foundational understanding of the vulnerabilities and risk towards potentially implementing wireless grid Edgeware technology in a virtualized cloud environment. Since communication networks and devices are subject to becoming the target of exploitation by hackers (e.g. individuals who attempt to gain unauthorized access to computer systems), these individuals are gaining ever-increasing knowledge of the often widely-reported exploitable vulnerabilities in these types of innovative technologies; and thus are able to craft increasingly effective computer network attacks against such technologies. Through a review of literature and a technical laboratory experiment against a wireless grid Edgeware product called the GridStreamX Edgeware application, this three essay thesis responds to the overall research proposition: what security vulnerability enumerations would contribute to the degradation and risk in using a wireless grid Edgeware application in a virtualized cloud environment? The first supporting research proposition includes the cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities towards the integration of a cloud computing and a wireless grid architecture (e.g. a wireless cloud) and proposes the following question: (Q1) what potential threats and vulnerabilities exist within the integration of a cloud computing and wireless grid (e.g., wireless cloud) architecture? The second research proposition identifies the security vulnerabilities and countermeasures of virtualization environments and proposes the following question: (Q2) in the area of virtualized computing environments, what are the common exploits of security properties and vulnerabilities that exist from the perspective of hackers performing cyber-attacks? A third proposition is investigated through a technical laboratory experiment of the GridStreamX Edgeware application and proposes the following research question: (Q3) what specific vulnerabilities are exploited against the GridStreamX Edgeware application in its operating environment utilizing an anatomy of a network attack? The findings from these three essays provide a greater understanding of the practical ways wireless grid Edgeware technology can be attacked and how proper countermeasures can be use to protect information systems using this technology from unauthorized modification or disclosure. This research also informs scholars and science-practitioners, who research information systems architectures, on defining security standards, protocols and policies for these new types of integrated and distributed computing architectures."
etd_277,Educating for Export: Producing Filipino Migrant Workers for the Global Market,Sociology,"globalization, higher education, migration, neoliberalism, Philippines, work","Largely ignored within the education literature is how a growing number of developing nations actively educate workers for overseas markets in order to maximize their future monetary remittances. By using emigration as a development strategy, these nations enforce a paradoxical application of human capital logic, where local institutions educate students to become productive workers for other countries. This project then investigates what happens when colleges and universities produce human capital for “export,” and global labor demands shape academic priorities in local classrooms. Locating my study in the Philippines, one of the largest labor-exporting nations in the world, this project examines how colleges and universities are embedded within a commodity chain of migrant labor, where developing nations fill the human capital needs of wealthier nations higher up the chain. I also demonstrate how human capital discourse reinforces this production process, creating an assumed relationship among academic credentials, overseas opportunity, and future migrant remittances. This project is based on participant observation in two Philippine universities, and interviews with Filipino educators, students, and school administrators. Findings indicate that attempts to produce migrant workers undermine the job security of college instructors, skew local curriculum towards foreign requirements, and challenge efforts to develop academic programs in line with local needs."
ppa_etd_86,"Education Finance Reform, School Choice, and Residential Sorting",Public Administration,"Property tax, School choice","Tiebout hypothesis, proposed by Tiebout and expanded by Oates, has been the touchstones in the area of local public finance. A growing body of research has explored the capitalization of the public service quality into housing prices, built on the Tiebout model. The existence of capitalization through residential mobility suggests that the education reforms can have the unintended consequences. Since households decide jointly where to live and where to send their children to school, people can respond to any educational reforms affecting the property tax rates and quality of schools by moving to another school district or placing their children to private schools. In turn, this residential sorting can affect the property tax base of school districts and the student composition of schools, which can substantially undermine or reinforce the intended impacts of reforms. These issues frame the overarching research question addressed in my dissertation: how important is the impact of residential sorting on the equity objectives of education reforms. Using ""consensus bid-function"" framework which integrates the local housing markets and local public services, my dissertation examines the impact of policy reforms on residential sorting: education finance reform in Maryland and inter-and intra-district choice reform in Korea, respectively."
etd_30,Education on the Underground Railroad: A Case Study of Three Communities in New York State (1820-1870),Cultural Foundations of Education,"African American, Antebellum, Education, Historiography, New York State, Research methods","In the mid-nineteenth century a compulsory education system was emerging that allowed all children to attend public schools in northern states. This dissertation investigates school attendance rates among African American children in New York State from 1850-1870 by examining household patterns and educational access for African American school-age children in three communities: Sandy Ground, Syracuse, and Watertown. These communities were selected because of their involvement in the Underground Railroad. I employed a combination of educational and social history methods, qualitative and quantitative. An analysis of federal census reports, state superintendent reports, city directories, area maps, and property records for the years 1820-1870 yielded comparative data on households, African American and European American, in which African American school-age children resided. The nature of schooling and the manner in which the household and community advocated for school attendance during this period are also described and compared. Between the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 and the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, advocates were preparing African Americans for full citizenship (suffrage rights, educational access, and home ownership) in these three communities and throughout New York State. Using Pearson's correlational coefficient, the data reveal that before the U.S. Civil War there was a significant correlation between African American school-age children's attendance in school, the head of household's literacy, and the head of household home ownership. In Sandy Ground the significance level was .05; in Syracuse the significance level was .05; and in Watertown the significance level was .01. This study reveals that African American children in the communities under study, whether they attended school or not, had access to literate adults.The dominant discourse on African American education in the United States is oftentimes told through the lens of post-Civil War emancipation in the South. In New York State, slavery was abolished in 1827, and the children identified in this study were the first generation of free-born African Americans in the state."
etd_78,Effect of Confinement and Temperature on the Behavior of EPS Geofoam,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Confining pressure, Creep deformations, EPS geofoam, Strength and Modulus, Thermal, Yield stress","EPS geofoam blocks underlying compacted soil and structural loads become subjected to multi-axial loading. Effects of confining pressure on the stress-strain behavior of EPS geofoam have been investigated in previous studies. Some studies found increases in confining stress lead to corresponding decreases in both modulus and compressive strength. Increasing confining stress has also been reported to result in higher compressive strength. Regardless of the sense and attributed significance of the effects of confinement on EPS geofoam behavior, the implied effects on performance are generally not considered in practice. A series of triaxial compression tests were conducted on EPS geofoams of different densities over a range of confining pressures. Results from the investigation indicate increases in confinement lead to decrease in yield stress and post yield compressive resistances, depending on the EPS density and range of confining pressures. The practical significances of confining stress effects are discussed. An approach for incorporating the more significant effects of confining stress on EPS geofoam behavior is considered.Evaluations of EPS-soil-structure interactions require reasonable representation of stress-strain relationships for numerical modeling. A method proposed in this work uses density of geofoam block and resin material properties to represent the stress-strain response of EPS geofoam. The stress-strain curves obtained from such representation are compared with results from laboratory tests and models by others. The stress-strain curves generated by the proposed method predict very well the relations especially for denser geofoams. A modified hyperbolic stress-strain relationships that can account for confining stress effects is also proposed. The modified hyperbolic model only requires three parameters that can be obtained from triaxial tests. Prediction accuracy of this model is compared with data from triaxial tests which were not part of data sets used to obtain model parameters. Comparison is made with other models proposed by different authors and the stress-strain relationships obtained by this approach predict test data well.Characteristics of inherent and stress induced anisotropy of EPS geofoam was investigated by triaxial tests conducted on pre-stressed EPS geofoam. Induced anisotropy was observed to reduce the modulus significantly.A series of creep tests were performed on different densities of EPS geofoam with and without confining pressures. The results showed confining pressures can significantly affect the creep responses of EPS geofoam. Effects of confining pressures on creep deformations were more pronounced for lower densities.Creep tests were performed in a temperature controlled chamber to evaluate effects of cyclic temperatures. Coupled effects of temperature and creep were studied for different stress levels. Comparisons were made to actual field observations and FLAC model results. Strains and induced stresses from seasonal temperature variations were relatively small."
etd_655,Effect of Severe Corrosion on Lateral Strength of Square RC Bridge Columns,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Column, Concrete, Corrosion, Deterioration, Finite Element Analysis, Lateral Strength","Corrosion of reinforcing steel bars is the primary durability problem that causes degradation of reinforced concrete structures located in aggressive environments. Severe corrosion of steel bars decreases the lateral load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete members, causes loss in the mechanical properties of reinforcement and cross-sectional area of steel bars and concrete cover, bond deterioration, reduces anchorage of steel bars, and decreases the confinement by transverse reinforcement. Consequently, corrosion results in drop in the lateral strength of columns. Therefore, studying response of corroded reinforced concrete columns subjected to lateral loads is necessary.According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) report in 2013, 25.9 percent of the total inventory of highway bridges are deficient or functionally obsolete. Corrosion damage caused by deicing salts is considered one of the main problems that cause a bridge structure to be structurally deficient (FHWA, 2004). However, absence of a practical model for assessment of the residual lateral strength of severely corroded RC columns as well as the lack of research on ultimate lateral capacity of deteriorated concrete structures shows the need to develop a practical method to calculate the current lateral capacity of corroded reinforced concrete bridge columns.A new methodology was developed in this research, to evaluate the current lateral strength of severely corroded RC columns, which can be adapted to existing bridge condition evaluation methods. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model to simulate severely corroded columns was created and verified against experimental data conducted by other researchers. After being verified against experimental data, a total of 308 Finite element models were developed to investigate several variables that affect the lateral response of corroded columns. A series of 24 in×24 in square column sections having different material properties were modeled as cantilevers. Location of corrosion within the cross-section (Compression-side corroded, Tension-side corroded, All-sides corroded), corrosion level (CR=25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%), length of corroded zone along the column height (1H=24in, 2H=48in), axial load ratio (NR=P/(f'c.Ag )=0%,5%,15%,25%), compressive strength of concrete (f'c=4ksi,7ksi), steel reinforcing ratio (?=2%,3%,4%) and shear span to depth ratio (L/d=2.5, 5) were the variables investigated in this study. For severely corroded RC columns, stirrups were assumed to be completely deteriorated and the concrete cover spalled off. Therefore, concrete cover and stirrups were removed at corroded locations. The corroded bars were assumed to be completely un-bonded to the surrounding concrete.Based on results obtained from the finite element analysis, a practical model was developed. The proposed practical method considers all the changes in material and geometry properties including area loss of corroded steel bars and concrete cover, bond deterioration and its consequences on corroded bars’ buckling, location of corroded zone, length of corroded zone along the column, compressive strength of concrete, reinforcing ratio of RC column section, axial load ratio, and shear span to depth ratio. This study also provides engineers better understanding of lateral response of severely corroded RC bridge columns with detailed force-displacement diagrams based on finite element analysis."
phy_etd_123,Effective Field Theories in Cosmology,Physics,"Cosmology, Effective Field Theories, Inflation, Lorentz Violation, Perturbations, Scalar-Tensor Theories","During the last 20 years, a large amount of detailed cosmological observations have promoted cosmology to the rank of high-precision science. Remarkably, all the observations currently available can be accounted for by assuming that (i) the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, (ii) gravitational interactions are described by General Relativity with a non-vanishing cosmological constant and (ii) 85% of the matter content of the universe is in the form of dark matter, a presently unknown type of matter which interacts with ordinary matter only gravitationally. Current theoretical efforts are focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the small departures from perfect homogeneity and isotropy observed in our universe, the nature of dark matter and the physical origin of the cosmological constant. Effective field theory methods provide a natural framework to try to address such outstanding questions. For instance, such methods have been extensively used to study alternative theories of gravity which mimic a non-vanishing cosmological constant and to build models of the early universe which generate the observed anisotropies and inhomogeneities through a period of accelerated cosmic expansion. In this thesis, we study effective field theories of gravity which violate some basic tenets of General Relativity such as Lorentz invariance and the weak equivalence principle. We also employ effective field theory methods to explore the imprint that high energy physics can leave on the small departures from homogeneity and isotropy generated in the early universe."
mar_etd_1,Effects of Advertising on Advance Selling and Online Search,Marketing,"Marketing, Business Administration","Advertising has been one of the most important marketing variables for both practices and academic literature, and it has been generally known to raise the firm's market share (Ataman, van Heerde, and Mela 2010). However, under the contemporary market environment, advertising's impact may be more complicated. For example, in advance selling practices, advertising today may increase today's sales, but it may or may not be profitable in the long run. In addition, traditional advertising may influence online consumer behavior.Chapter one of the dissertation studies optimal intertemporal advertising and pricing decision of an advance selling firm. This chapter proposes a structural empirical framework to control for advertising and pricing endogeneity in the presence of a large product line under capacity constraints. The approach uses the shadow prices from the firm's constrained maximization problem to link strategic decisions over time, a middle ground between existing dynamic and static choice models. The framework is applied to data from a major cruise line using a nested logit to represent heterogeneous consumer demand. The results show that demand cannibalization is the primary driver of dynamic pricing and that advertising helps to build category demand. A counterfactual experiment suggests that dynamic pricing accounts for 18% of the seller's variable profit.Chapter two studies the relationship between traditional advertising and consumers' online search behavior. Despite a 20-year trend toward integrated marketing communications, advertisers almost never coordinate television and search advertising campaigns. This chapter investigates the simplest possible explanation for this phenomenon, the possibility that television advertising does not influence online search. It finds a statistically significant relationship between television advertising for financial services brands and consumers' tendency to search branded keywords (e.g. ""Fidelity"") rather than generic category-related keywords (e.g. ""stocks""). The effect is largest for young brands during standard business hours with an elasticity, .07, comparable to extant measurements of advertising's impact on sales. However, television advertising is not related to category search incidence. These findings confirm the external validity of previous experimental findings and suggest that practitioners should account for these effects when planning, executing, and evaluating both television and search advertising campaigns."
etd_373,Effects of an Expressive Writing Intervention Aimed at Improving Academic Performance by Reducing Test Anxiety,Psychology,"college students, exam performance, expressive writing, intervention, test anxiety","This study examined the effectiveness of a brief, class-wide, expressive writing intervention aimed at improving academic performance and decreasing test anxiety.  This study included 110 students from six undergraduate psychology classes.  In the first phase of the study, students completed a trait test anxiety measure and a demographic survey.  In the second phase of the study, students completed a pre-intervention state test anxiety measure, responded to a 10-minute writing prompt (expressive or neutral), and completed the same state test anxiety measure, and then were administered an in-class exam.  Approximately half the students were randomly assigned to the expressive writing group, and asked to write about their concerns and worries regarding the exam; and the other half assigned to the neutral writing group, and asked to write about how they used their time during the past 24 hours.  Contrary to some previous studies (Ramirez & Beilock, 2011; Park, Ramirez & Beilock), this study found no significant group differences between the expressive writing group and the neutral writing group in academic performance or change in test anxiety.  This expressive writing intervention was found to be ineffective in improving academic performance and at decreasing test anxiety.  Interestingly, the strongest predictor of exam performance was previous exam performance, and test anxiety was a very weak predictor of exam performance.  Possible reasons for disparate research findings are discussed."
etd_305,Effects of plant invasions on ecosystem processes: Linking above- and below-ground resource-use strategies of native and invasive species in Eastern U.S. forests,Biology,"Eastern United States, Nutrient cycling, Plant invasions, Plant-soil feedback, Temperate deciduous forests, Understory woody species","Despite the increasing number of non-native invasive species worldwide and their potential impacts on ecosystems, the mechanisms that invaders alter ecosystem nutrient processes remain elusive. Invaders are often more productive than native species which suggests invaders may have different above- and below-ground resource-use strategies that can profoundly alter ecosystem processes. Here I investigated above- and below-ground plant traits and soil properties associated with resource-use strategies and soil nitrogen (N) dynamics for multiple native and non-native forest understory species in the Eastern U.S. to better understand invader impacts on ecosystem processes. In the first study, performed in a common garden, I examined the linkage between above- and below-ground resource-use strategies for native and invasive species that allow invaders to be more productive than co-occurring natives. Results showed that, despite invaders losing a significant amount of N from litter, they had greater root production and specific root length associated with a greater soil nutrient uptake capacity than natives. In the second study, I examined whether the different tissue traits are associated with litter decomposition rate and if invaders can increase nutrient cycling through faster litter decomposition than natives. Results revealed no differences in leaf and root decomposition rates between native and non-native forest understory woody species, suggesting that litter decomposition rate is not a process that invasive species affect with regard to soil nutrient processes in the Eastern U.S. forests. Finally, I investigated invader impacts on soil N processes in a monoculture experiment. After two growing seasons, invaders had greater above- and below-ground productivity. Invaders facilitated N cycling via greater litter N input into the soil that increased soil N availability, and had greater fine root production and SRL that increased plant N uptake. Although the greater aboveground production of invaders reduced soil temperature and moisture, which can reduce soil microbial activity, the stimulatory effects of a greater flow of litter N to the soil appeared to overwhelm any negative effects that invaders had on the soil microclimate. Taken together, my results suggest that invaders have different above-and below-ground resource-use strategies and invaders' greater productivity is one of the major drivers that can significantly change ecosystem processes."
etd_261,Effects of social endorsement on news evaluation in Korea and the U.S.,Mass Communications,"Cross-national analysis, Experiment, Korea, Online news, Social endorsement, U.S.","This dissertation has three overarching objectives. First, it aims to examine the effects of social endorsements on news processing as compared to the effects of media credibility. Second, it investigates whether there are cross-national variations in the process. Third, it explores what role individuals’ self-construal plays in these relationships. I conducted a 2 x 2 x 3 between-subjects experiment (N = 567) in which country (Korea vs. U.S.), media credibility (high vs. low), and social endorsement level (none vs. low vs. high) were manipulated.Results demonstrate that social endorsements affect the way people perceive and evaluate the quality of online news content. In the experiment, subjects who saw a news article with a high number of social endorsements perceived the quality of the news article to be higher, as compared to those who saw no endorsement. Results also indicate that social endorsements reduce the effects of media credibility on perceived quality of news. The gap between the effects of high credibility media and low credibility media on perceived quality of news article decreased when more people endorsed the article. However, these findings applied only to the U.S., not Korea.This dissertation also finds that Korean subjects are not dominantly collectivistic as many scholars assumed. Rather, the Korean subjects displayed a bi-cultural tendency with almost equal levels of independent and interdependent self-construal. While the U.S. subjects demonstrated dominantly independent self-construal, they also reported stronger interdependent self-construal than Korean subjects. Results also suggest that independent and interdependent self-construals may influence the direction and magnitude of social endorsement effects on perceived quality of news to some extent, albeit not as the primary factor.Upon the growing socialization of online news, this dissertation provides a better understanding of the role of social endorsements in news processing. Specifically, the interplay between media credibility and social endorsements in news evaluation suggests that the importance of media credibility in news processing might need to be re-examined and re-evaluated. This dissertation also reveals that there could be cross-national or within-national variations in the role of social endorsements in news processing. These findings carry meaningful implications for scholars and practitioners in various fields of communications."
etd_453,Effects of substrate stiffness on bacterial biofilm formation,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"bacterial adhesion, bacterial mechanosensing, biofilm, cell tracking, material stiffness, phagocytosis","Biofilms are communities of microbial cells attached on surfaces and embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix comprised of polysaccharides, DNA, and proteins. Biofilms of pathogenic bacteria cause serious chronic infections due to high tolerance to antibiotics and host immune systems compared to their planktonic compartments. Biofilm formation is known to be influenced by many properties of substrate materials, such as surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, roughness, topography, and charge. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of substrate stiffness. In this study, Escherichia coli RP437 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were used as model strains to investigate the early stage biofilm formation on poly(dimethylsil-oxane) (PDMS) with varying stiffness of 0.1 MPa to 2.6 MPa, which were prepared by controlling the degree of crosslinking.An inverse correlation between cell adhesion and substrate stiffness was observed for both E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, it was found that the cells attached on relatively stiff substrates were significantly shorter than those on relatively soft substrates, and the distribution of cell length was narrower on stiff substrates. In addition to the difference in size, the cells on stiff substrates were also found to be less susceptible to antimicrobials, such as ofloxacin, ampicillin, tobramycin and lysozyme, than the cells attached on soft substrates. The cell tracking results revealed that the E. coli cells on stiff surfaces were more mobile than those on soft surfaces, suggesting that the cells attached on soft surfaces may enter biofilm stage faster. Consistently, the intracellular level of c-di-GMP (an important signal for biofilm formation) in the cells on soft surfaces was higher than that of cells on stiff surfaces.Comparison of the wild-type strains and isogenic mutants revealed that the motB mutant of E. coli RP437 has defects in response to the stiffness of PDMS, which was rescued by complementation of the motB gene. Additionally, the cell tracking results indicate that the mutation of motB rendered the cells much less mobile compared to wild type E. coli RP437 strains, and the decrease in the velocity of motility is higher on stiff surfaces than on soft surfaces. Those results suggest that motB may play a role in mechanosensing of material stiffness by E. coli. Similarly, mutation of oprF in P. aeruginosa also caused major defects in response to PDMS stiffness and abolished the difference in adhesion, growth, morphology and antibiotic susceptibility of attached cells between soft and stiff PDMS surfaces. These defects were rescued by genetic complementation of oprF, suggesting that oprF is involved in mechnosensing of P. aeruginosa.In summary, the findings from this study indicate that material stiffness has potent effects on bacterial adhesion and the physiology of attached cells. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of material stiffness of silicon-based polymers on biofilm formation, and the first report of the effects of material stiffness on the physiology of attached cells. These results are helpful for designing better anti-fouling materials."
etd_372,"Effects of Ultrasound as Visual Feedback of the Tongue on Generalization, Retention, and Acquisition in Speech Therapy for Rhotics",Communication Sciences and Disorders,"speech sound disorders, ultrasound treatment, visual feedback","Purpose:  The purpose of this study was to provide an initial comparison of exposure to ultrasound visual feedback of the tongue and no exposure to ultrasound in speech therapy for postvocalic rhotics (the /r/ family of sounds).  Effects of the two treatments on acquisition, retention, and generalization were explored in participants ages 7-9.Methods:  A single-subject randomized block design replicated across four participants was used.  Each week for seven weeks, one session containing high frequency ultrasound use and one session containing no ultrasound use were randomly ordered.  A Training Probe List and Generalization Probe List consisting of monosyllabic words, multisyllabic words, phrases, and short sentences were used to measure acquisition within each session as well as retention and generalization between two consecutive sessions.  Data analyses included: (a) descriptive statistics to complement visual inspections of single-subject graphs, (b) effect size calculation, and (c) statistical results from a randomization test.Results: One participant showed a significant advantage for ultrasound sessions over no ultrasound sessions in acquisition scores; however, there were no differences between treatment conditions for any participants in generalization or retention.Conclusion: For some children, acquisition may be facilitated by ultrasound visual feedback.  No evidence suggested that ultrasound visual feedback inhibited retention or generalization in speech tasks.  As a whole, treatment was effective for 2 of the 4 participants when comparing pre/post generalization data.  Future studies should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of ultrasound visual feedback therapy given a larger dose (i.e., treatment duration) and differing age groups."
etd_504,"Effects of vlogger race on perceived credibility, self-efficacy and behavioral intentions towards weight loss",Media Studies,"Interactive media, Spokesperson effect","Spokesperson race and expertise have exhibited an impact on audiences. This study examines the effect of race congruency between vlogger and audience in regards to weight loss. Using social psychology and communication theories, including Elaboration Likelihood Model, spokesperson effects, the Theory of Planned Behavior, social cognitive theory, and self-efficacy theory, the current study features independently produced vlogs (video blogs) discussing weight loss strategies. The race and expertise of the vloggers in the videos were manipulated to test the effects on perceived message and source credibility, self-efficacy towards exercising and dieting, and behavioral intentions towards exercising and dieting.Results reveal that, although race congruency demonstrates limited effect on the outcome variables, it interacts with participant race, ethnic identity, and vlogger expertise to predict perceived message credibility, self-efficacy towards exercising and dieting, and behavioral intentions towards exercising and dieting. Asian American participants report greater perceived message credibility and behavioral intentions towards exercising and dieting after watching an Asian American vlogger compared to a White American vlogger. Asian American participants with low ethnic identity report greater self-efficacy towards exercising and dieting after watching an Asian American vlogger compared to a White American vlogger, while White American participants with low ethnic identity report greater self-efficacy towards exercising after watching an Asian American vlogger compared to a White American vlogger. Furthermore, perceived message credibility mediates the effect of the interaction of race congruency and participant race on participant’s behavioral intentions towards exercising and dieting. This study provides insights for understanding spokesperson effect and designing health campaigns in the interactive media environment."
psy_etd_176,Efficacy of an Expectancy Challenge to Reduce Non-Prescribed Use of Stimulant Medications among College Students,Psychology,"college students, expectancies, stimulant medication","Non-prescribed use of stimulant medications among college students, such as Ritalin®, and Adderall®, has become a public health concern. Expectancies, which are beliefs that individuals hold regarding the consequences of engaging in a particular behavior, are known to play a prominent role in the initiation and maintenance of alcohol and drug use. This study had two aims: (1) to determine if an expectancy challenge could reduce participants' academic performance expectancies related to non-prescribed use of stimulant mediations, and (2) to determine if change in expectancies mediates consumption of the drug. Seventy-eight undergraduate students were randomized to either the expectancy challenge (EC) condition, the psychoeducation (PE) condition, or the assessment only (AO) condition. Results from two separate hierarchical linear models (HLM) indicated that there were no significant group differences between the EC and PE conditions with regards to change in expectancies (yslope = 0.19, t(43) = 1.97, p = 0.055) or consumption (yslope = 0.06, t(43) = 1.75, p = 0.09). When the two treatment conditions were combined, results from the HLM analyses found a significant effect of treatment over control for both expectancies (yslope = -0.25, t(76) = -3.64, p < 0.001) and consumption (yslope = -0.07, t(76) = -2.07, p = 0.04). The mediation analysis indicated a non-significant relationship between the mediating variable (i.e., change in academic expectancies) and the outcome variable (change in consumption; yslope = 0.0004, t(76) = 0.098, p = 0.992), indicating that mediation was not present. Due to an inferior placebo manipulation, the EC did not produce the anticipated results. However, results from the study suggest that the didactic component of the EC and PE conditions was effective in modifying expectancies and reducing consumption."
etd_501,Efficient search algorithms for social networking scheduling applications,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Evolutionary Algorithms, Genetic Algorithms, Optimization, Social network","Social networks have recently emerged as the most important modality for inter-personal interactions, communication and information sharing. Examples include services from Facebook, Google+, Linkedin, Twitter, Tinder, OKCupid, etc., each of which has a specific purpose and caters to particular needs, but has some limitations. This thesis proposes a real-time social networking platform that facilitates finding others available to meet or participate on a shared activity during a mutually agreeable time period, accounting for several factors such as availability of users, choice of activities, geographical locations, and/or other preferences. The focus of this research is to design scalable, robust, and efficient algorithms to facilitate social interactions, searching for the most appropriate users from a large database. First, we focused on a single objective, viz., physical distance, and designed an efficient search algorithm that is applicable when user characteristics change constantly with time, and can be readily implemented on mobile devices.  Such constraints imply that many traditional search algorithms are too computationally expensive.  We proposed an evolutionary algorithm using a small population size and a new recombination operator (HMCC) for this task, accounting for the problem that traditional recombination operators may generate infeasible solutions. The new algorithm outperformed several existing algorithms, and scales well even when the number of users is very large. We then extended this algorithm to a multi-objective optimization context, considering other objectives such as user availability during a time period, and strength of relationship (in a social network) to the user who conducts the search.  We developed a new multi-objective algorithm (MONA) for this task, combining aspects of multi-objective versions of evolutionary strategies and genetic algorithms.  Experimental simulations with several large datasets showed that the new algorithm performed better than other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, though not in all cases. Scalability of the algorithm was successfully demonstrated, with very large geographical areas and numbers of users; the number of function evaluations varied linearly with increasing input size. The proposed algorithm, framework and methodology are expected to be useful in many practical applications."

Yet for many, the college experience presents with a series of physical, emotional, and psychological challenges, and for some even failure. It is expected that many of these students will experience such stressors, given the complexity of the stage of development, as they move away from adolescence and into adulthood. As college students move away from parental figures and develop more independence, a prominent time for identity development to thrive is created. There is a great deal of scholarly literature on the college experience, especially the stressors that students face and how college counselors can support their overall wellness. Additionally, there has been a large body of research over the past several decades on identity development of emerging adults. Yet there is scant research that explores how identity development shapes the overall wellness of college students. This research studied the relationships between negative affectivity (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress), ego identity development, and wellness of traditionally-aged undergraduate college students. It also tested if ego identity development mediates the relationship between negative affectivity and wellness. Despite significant relationships between the constructs, the results were surprising, indicating that ego identity development has less of an impact, if any, on negative affectivity and wellness as predicted. However, the results did suggest there is much more to wellness than mental health. Therefore, this study served as a foundation for a new direction in wellness research, as well as provided new ways for college counselors to engage students in supporting their overall wellness and helping them developing resiliency and the skills they need to thrive."
etd_307,"Electricity Generation Location and Benefits to Human Health: What health benefits can be attributed to RGGI in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania?",Social Sciences,"cap and trade, CO2, global warming, RGGI","This paper estimates the benefits, primarily from human health gains, from the longest running U.S. CO2 control program.  Further, it examines the patterns of electric generation to evaluate changes at regional and state levels, to better understand the potential of CO2 leakage, which is CO2 being emitted from generation that has moved from a regulated to a non-regulated state, and thus weakening the effects of the regulation.This examination is achieved using a unique dataset of observed generation levels at fossil fuel plants from the year 2000 to 2013, in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.  It is estimated that the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has reduced CO2 emissions in New York State and New Jersey by approximately 4.9 million short tons yearly on average, and has produced approximately $130 million worth of ancillary benefits from reduced SO2, NOX, PM2.5, and PM10, emissions yearly, while New Jersey participated.  Just in New York, which has participated every year since the program inception in 2009, RGGI has produced approximately 3.5 million short tons and over $69 million worth of ancillary benefits yearly on average.  Further, the study finds weak evidence that RGGI has altered generation between New York and Pennsylvania during the study period.  However, it finds stronger evidence that there may have been leakage from Maryland and Delaware to Pennsylvania.  There are indications that RGGI has contributed to significant changes in generation regionally in New Jersey and New York."
etd_238,Electrochemical Aspects of Metalllic Biocompatibility,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Biocompatibility, Corrosion, Implants, Retrieval Analysis","Metallic biomaterials used for orthopedic and other biomedical applications are often subjected to complex mechanical, biological and electrochemical conditions. Traditionally, metallic biocompatibility is often regarded as the more corrosion resistant a material is, the more biocompatible the metal is. However, mechanically assisted corrosion such as fretting can lead to the disruption of the oxide film which is crucial for inertness of the metal surface. In most cases, the oxide film will spontaneously repassivate. However, repassivation of the oxide film can result in a cathodic shift in the potential of the metal implant. While most of the ongoing work in the metallic biomaterials community focuses on the impact of metal ion toxicity and tribological corrosion byproducts on adjoining tissues and device performance, there is a need to understand the effect of cathodic voltages on cell behavior. This work studies the inter-relationship between the electrochemical behavior of metal surfaces and cells growing on it. The first part of the dissertation focuses on the impact of cathodic shift of voltage on the behavior of cells that populate these metal surfaces. This study shows that cathodic voltages or reduction reactions occurring on metal surfaces can alter cell viability. The results show that the effects of cathodic potential is both a voltage and time-dependent phenomena. Reduction reactions occurring on the metal surface was shown to alter the metal surface in the presence of cell culture media and have an impact on cell viability. To understand the effect of cathodic potentials on cells on a finer time scale, a novel electrochemical cell culture chamber was developed to acquire timelapse images of cells responding to these cathodic potentials.The second part of this dissertation explores the impact of inflammatory cells on the clinical performance of orthopedic devices. This study is based on a forensic retrieval analysis of cobalt-chromium and titanium based implants. This work presents the first in vivo evidences for inflammatory cell induced corrosion of cobalt chromium and titanium based alloys. Inflammatory cells induced corrosion was observed on both articular and non-articular surfaces of the implants. The results presented in this study also show that inflammatory cells can cause severe corrosion in the modular tapers junctions of acetabular liners and also impact the tribological performance of the bearing surfaces. The patterns of corrosion closely represents the morphology of the cells that took part in the corrosion attack and the resulting corrosion damage was similar on both cobalt and titanium alloys. Based on the results presented in this study, a new concept of metallic biocompatibility is introduced where voltage and inflammatory cells play a crucial role in dictating the biocompatibility of a metal surface."
etd_77,Electrochemical Control of Bacterial Persister Cells,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Biofilms, Direct Current (DC), Electrodes, Metal cations, Persisters, Rabbit model","The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has presented an increasing challenge to infection control. Conventional methods of antibacterial treatment involving high dose of antibiotics or surgical intervention have proven insufficient for eradicating persistent infections, such as those associated with medical implants. It is well recognized that bacterial populations commonly contain a small percentage of phenotypic variants, known as persister cells, which are metabolically inactive and extremely tolerant to antibiotics. When the antibiotic treatment is stopped, surviving persister cells can regenerate the bacterial population with a similar percentage of persister cells. Thus, persistence presents a great challenge to curing chronic infections.In this study, we introduced a novel method for controlling bacterial persistence based on a phenomenon we named electrochemical control of persister cells (ECCP). We demonstrate that bacterial persister cells can be effectively eliminated by low-level direct currents (DCs); e.g. treatment with 70 ?A/cm2 DC for 1 h using stainless steel (SS) 304 reduced the number of viable planktonic persister cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 by 98% compared to the untreated control. In addition to persister killing by applying DC alone, synergistic effects were observed when treating persister cells with 70 ?A/cm2 DC and 1.5 ?g/mL tobramycin together using SS 304 electrodes. The same level of DC was also found to be cidal to biofilm associated persister cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Based on this discovery, the electrophysiological properties of P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells treated with 70 ?A/cm2 DC using carbon and SS 304 electrodes were characterized both at the cellular and genetic levels to understand the mechanism of ECCP. We found that DC treatments affected surface charge and membrane integrity of P. aeruginosa, leading to increase intracellular concentration of metal cations as observed via scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis. Moreover, electrochemical treatments mediated via carbon electrodes provoked the permeabilization of the cells to extracellular materials, and increased their susceptibility to antibiotics, which led to complete eradication of the persisters. These findings are corroborated by DNA microarray analysis, which revealed that DC treatments have profound effects on the physiology of persister cells, altering the regulation of genes involved in antibiotic resistance, pyocin-related functions, and SOS response. Comparative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of the stationary phase P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells confirmed that DC treatments resulted in the compartmentalization of intracellular contents, release of outer membrane vesicles, or cell lysis.To design novel systems to effectively control infections associated with biofilms and persister cells, the safety and the efficacy of ECCP were evaluated in co-culture models with human epithelial cells and P. aeruginosa PAO1. In addition, a pilot animal study was conducted to investigate the effects of electrochemical currents using a rabbit model of sinus infections. P. aeruginosa PAO1 was used to induce rhinosinusitis in rabbits, which were then treated with antibiotics, or antibiotics with electrical current, and compared with the untreated controls. The results of this study validated the effectiveness of electrochemical treatment in reducing both biofilms and planktonic cells in vivo. Overall, these findings improved the understanding of the electrophysiology of bacterial persister cells, and provided new insight for designing novel systems to effectively control infections associated with biofilms and persister cells."
etd_606,Elevational and Seasonal Patterns in Methylmercury Production Across the Montane Landscape of Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Region of New York,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Adirondacks, Forest, Mercury, Methylmercury, Soil","Global mercury contamination results from direct primary atmospheric and secondary legacy emissions, which can be deposited to ecosystems, converted to methylmercury, and bioaccumulated along food chains.  I examined soil samples collected across an elevational gradient on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack region of New York State to determine spatial patterns in methylmercury concentrations across a forested montane landscape.  I found that soil methylmercury concentrations were highest in the mid-elevation coniferous zone (0.39 ± 0.07 ng/g) compared to the alpine (0.28 ± 0.04 ng/g) and deciduous zones (0.17 ± 0.02 ng/g), while the percent mercury as methylmercury in soils decreased linearly with elevation.  In multivariate linear analysis, soil sulfur concentrations had the greatest positive influence on soil MeHg concentrations, although they only explained 3.2% of the variability in soil MeHg concentrations.  Soil MeHg concentrations appear to be driven by internal processing of Hg and not by deposition of MeHg to the forest floor and vary seasonally.  These findings for methylmercury concentrations are consistent with patterns of mercury concentrations in terrestrial bird species and suggest that future declines in mercury emissions could be important to reducing concentrations of mercury in montane avian species."
etd_396,Eliciting Bootstrapping: The Development of Introductory Statistics Students’ Informal Inferential Reasoning via Resampling,Teaching and Leadership,Statistics Education,"Bootstrapping has become an important tool for statisticians, who assert that it is intuitive to novice statistics students. The process of collecting bootstrap resamples was once time demanding, but technology now allows data collection to be performed nearly instantaneously. This study focuses on the construction and development of secondary and tertiary introductory statistics students' (n=68) reasoning about bootstrapping and informal inference. Students engaged in a four-week instructional unit designed as two model development sequences. Through the use of hands-on manipulatives and technology, students constructed and developed reasoning of sampling, the resampling process of bootstrapping, and inference. The focus of my analysis was on the model development of four focus groups of students. Groups of students constructed models of sampling and inference that they used to collect samples, aggregate the samples to form an empirical sampling distribution, and use the aspects of this distribution of samples to make claims about the population from which the samples were drawn. I summarize and categorize groups of students’ models and trace the development of the focus groups’ models throughout the unit.Simulation of data led some students to develop a global view of the randomness of sampling and reason with multiple aspects of empirical sampling distributions to draw inferential claims. Some students applied a multiplicative view of the sample and global view of the sampling process to construct a resampling process similar to bootstrapping, but fell short of constructing the bootstrapping process by not collecting resamples that were equal in size to the original sample. Class discussion of a follow-up activity, similar in structure to the model eliciting activity, encouraged students to consider the value of drawing resamples of equal size to the population and led students to construct the method of bootstrapping. Students then used thebootstrapping process to drawn inferences about one population and to compare two populations of data.The findings of this study contribute to the field of statistics education by examining student thinking while constructing and developing bootstrapping methods, as well as investigating the relationship between this thinking and the drawing of informal inferences. This study demonstrates that it is possible for model development sequences to elicit and develop students’ models of bootstrapping. With the trend in statistics education of moving from the focus on theoretical distributions towards the simulation and analysis of data, these findings have implications towards the design of future introductory statistics curricula."
etd_451,Elucidating the Electronic Origins of Intermolecular Forces in Crystalline Solids,Chemistry,"Computational Chemistry, Density Functional Theory, Spectroscopy, Terahertz, Theoretical Chemistry, X-ray Diffraction","It is not possible to study almost any physical system without considering intermolecular forces (IMFs), no matter how insignificant they may appear relative to other energetic factors. Countless studies have shown that IMFs are responsible for governing a wide variety of physical properties, but often the atomic-origins of such interactions elude experimental detection. A considerable amount of work throughout the course of this research was therefore placed on using quantum mechanical simulations, specifically density functional theory (DFT), to calculate the electronic properties of solid-materials. The goal of these calculations was a better understanding of the precise origins of interatomic energies, down to the single-electron level. Furthermore, experimental X-ray diffraction and terahertz spectroscopy were both utilized because they are able to broadly probe the potential energy surfaces of molecular crystals, enhancing the theoretical data. Combining DFT calculations with experimental measurements enabled in-depth studies into the nature of specific non-covalent interactions, with results that were often unexpected based on conventional descriptions of IMFs.  Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in understanding how subtle changes in characteristics like orbital occupation or electron density can have profound effects on bulk properties, highlighting the fragile relationship that exists between the numerous energetic parameters occurring within condensed phase systems."
etd_387,Embedded Technical Communication Instruction: Understanding High-Context Writing in a Pre-Professional Engineering Program,Writing Program,"composition, context, engineering, genre, rhetoric","The requirement for engineering students to enter their professions with appropriate technical communication competencies has been well-documented (Connors, 1982; Winsor, 1990; Connor, 1991; Adams, 1993; Vest, Long and Anderson, 1996; Conrad, Dusicka and Pfeiffer, 2010; Sulcas and English, 2010; Steiner, 2011; Desjardins, Dore and Chasse, 2012). Highly contextualized technical communication instruction has been shown to allow engineering programs to meet the communication requirements and practices of their students’ future professions (Dudley, 1971; Gwiasda, 1984; Engle, 1989; Freiermuth, 2003; Flammia, 2005; Davis, 2010; Gale, Pitula, and Radhakrishnan, 2010).High-context technical communication instruction places student writers in design and development environments where they produce artifacts for readers who have real information needs (Cook and Mings, 2005; Paretti, 2006). In this project, I explore how high-context instruction shapes the quality of pre-professional student writing. Additionally, I analyze how rhetorical genre awareness and the quality of student writing are shaped by higher degrees of contextualized instruction.Chapter One: Addressing the Technical Communication Requirements of the Modern EngineerIn this chapter, I claim that engineers working in design and development environments function as technical communicators engaged in information design activities. I begin with a brief history of technical and engineering writing instruction to identify the ways in which the academy has responded to the evolving communication requirements of professional engineers. I propose that before engineers can improve their technical communication skills, they must first learn how to value the textual and graphical artifacts they produce during design. I then describe how a specific type of undergraduate technical writing course was created at Syracuse University to address some of the issues noted above, and how the course has evolved to address a broader set of engineering communication requirements.Chapter Two: Situating High-Context Technical CommunicationIn this chapter, I present a framework of instructional practices and strategies to describe how highly contextualized technical communication instruction exposes pre-professional engineers to the rhetorical, social, and compositional requirements of their work. I use the framework as a bridge between my central claim and the data presented and discussed in Chapter 4. I present and discuss examples of technical communication instruction that move students through disciplinary theories and practices in multiple rhetorical and social contexts for presenting themselves as writers, communicators, and engineers. I also review alternative arguments within Rhetoric, Composition, and Technical Communication that counterclaim the value of contextualized instruction.Chapter Three: Methods and RationaleIn this chapter, I describe my research method and rationale for coding and analyzing document structures, and instances and types of rhetorical movements, grammatical choices, and mechanical decisions that pre-professional engineers make in specific engineering design deliverables. I then describe my data set and my decisions to select specific design artifacts for coding and analysis.Chapter Four: Results and AnalysisIn this chapter, I present and analyze the results of my coding activities, and then move to a broader discussion of the results. I frame my discussion with the claims and cited literature in Chapter 2, specifically prior research that demonstrates the active role of context and genre in improving knowledge of specialized discourse communities. This literature, coupled with the results and subsequent analysis, support my central claim that embedded technical communication instruction provides useful spaces in which to replicate social and rhetorical contexts for repeatable practice with specialized genres.Chapter Five: Interpretation and RecommendationsIn this chapter, I interpret the results of the coding project within the framework of the various descriptions of contextualized technical communication instruction presented in Chapter 2. My interpretation is significantly influenced by the current version of WRT 401/402 (detailed in Appendix A) and how the course serves as an example of highly contextualized, genre-centric technical communication instruction. My data and subsequent analysis indicate that improvements in quality are realized only at the statement level when the engineering activity is performed as a writing act. Upon these findings I recommend an approach for updating an undergraduate engineering curriculum with a range of genre-centric contextualized instructional options."
etd_496,"Embodiment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Discourse: Healing, Silence and the Miracle Cure",Communication and Rhetorical Studies,"Discourse Analysis, Ethnography, Health Communication, Language and Social Interaction, TCM","Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a thousand-year old medical practice originated in China, has stepped into the western world with globalization for years. TCM has entered the West with its foreign, distant and “unscientific” concepts despite the fact that medicine globalization is still a contested concept.  My thesis aims to understand the embodied concepts of TCM through practitioner-patient interaction as culturally specific constructs. Among many TCM medical and philosophical concepts, I specifically focus on the healing, the silence and the miracle cure and how they are embodied and co-constructed by the practitioner and the patient during acupuncture, herb prescription and tuina massage treatment sessions. Using a discourse analytic approach informed by ethnographic field notes and interviews conducted in 2014 Kunming China, my thesis looks at data of video recordings of acupuncture, pulse reading and tuina massage sessions, through which I define the embodiments of TCM discourse are feelings as healing, interacting silences and the “miracle-minded” (Zhan, 2009) cure. The current thesis will provide groundwork for future inter/cross-cultural TCM practitioner-patient interaction comparison for the purpose of developing culturally competent alternative healthcare materials. It also provides the interactional and cultural insights to further research how to handle the interculturality of TCM in the West for the purpose of the betterment of the holistic treatment in the United States.  Also, through studying the embodiment of TCM concepts in interaction, it provides us interactional and cultural insights to further our understandings of the interculturality with TCM labeled as the holistic treatment around the world."
etd_365,Emotion Recognition and Hypertension Risk: The Associations of Elevated Resting Blood Pressure and Accuracy of Emotion Recognition,Psychology,"blood pressure, emotion, emotional dampening, emotion response","Emotion research has benefited from standardized sets of emotional expressions. Compared to the wealth of research on the recognition of static displays of emotion, only a few studies have examined dynamic information presentation.  The Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES) is a set of emotion stimuli that contains video clips of standardized expressions of emotions (Van der Schalk et al., 2011).  In the Phase 1 pilot study, psychometric properties of the ADFES were examined with a sample of 110 college students.  The most accurate and reliable emotion stimuli were used in Phase 2, in which the link between blood pressure and emotion response and recognition was examined.  One perspective of this link emphasizes an overall dampening of emotional responses to affect-laden stimuli (McCubbin et al., 2011), whereas another emphasizes perceiving emotions in a way that maximizes positive affect and minimizes negative affect (Jorgensen Johnson, Kolodziej, & Schreer, 1996).  To compare these theoretical perspectives, Phase 2 sought to examine the relationships between resting BP and the recognition and response to dynamic facial stimuli.   Analyses showed that systolic BP (? = .26; t = 2.30, p = .02) was a significant predictor of the valance rating assigned to surprise stimuli, and diastolic BP (? = .22; t = 2.02, p = .05) was a significant predictor of the arousal rating assigned to joy stimuli.  Further, regression analyses revealed that diastolic BP (? = -.30; t = -2.84, p = .006) was inversely associated with the accuracy of the appraisal fear stimuli.  Finally, regression analyses also revealed that systolic BP (? = .34; t = 2.92, p < .01) was a significant predictor of reaction time when viewing anger stimuli and disgust stimuli (? = .29; t = 2.59, p = .01). These results are consistent with a bias toward accentuating positive emotions while minimizing acknowledgement of negative emotions.  Research directions related to response dampening versus positive response bias are discussed."
etd_687,Enabling Justice: State Cooperation with the International Criminal Court,Political Science,"Africa, compliance, International Criminal Court, norms, transitional justice","This dissertation analyzes state cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC, or the Court). State cooperation is the precondition for the Court to bring perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity to justice. The Court does not have a police force of its own to enforce its arrest warrants and court requests. Consequently, the ICC depends on the cooperation and assistance of states and international organizations to arrest suspects and facilitate the Court’s work in various ways. Through qualitative methods, including case studies, content analysis, and process tracing, I investigate how states support or undermine the Court’s work through mandatory compliance as well as voluntary cooperation.Based on in-depth case studies of two African ICC states parties—South Africa and Kenya—I develop a new framework to classify states into four types of cooperators (model cooperators, pro forma cooperators, cheap talkers, and non-cooperators) based on whether they engaged in mandatory compliance and/or voluntary cooperation for institution weakening or institution strengthening. While mandatory engagement refers to specific compliance requirements governments take on when they join the Court as states parties, such as complying with court requests, voluntary cooperation refers to support behavior that goes beyond the Rome Statute, such as diplomacy and public statements.In the case study chapters, I trace South Africa and Kenya’s cooperation behavior longitudinally to describe their shifts from model cooperators to pro-forma and non-cooperators and explain these countries’ cooperation behavior in the al-Bashir and Kenyatta court cases. While South Africa failed to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he visited the country in June 2015, the Kenyan government cooperated to some extent with the ICC while also undermining the Court regionally and domestically. I complement these case studies with a content analysis of what states say about the Court at the UN to show how discourse about the ICC has developed over time and what states like and dislike about the Court’s work. I contrast this venue with the African Union’s (AU) position on the Court. While more critical of the ICC, the AU’s focus lies on the Court’s charges against sitting African heads of state rather than the overall portfolio of ICC situations.The dissertation’s findings relate to how states parties cooperate with the ICC and when and why they cooperate. First, I find that states can simultaneously cooperate with the Court while undermining it in other forums. Kenya engaged in a multifaceted strategy that included mandatory cooperation but also diplomacy and statements against the Court. Second, I find that the AU plays an important role as a mediator in the state-ICC relationship. The AU functioned as a forum for ICC-critical African leaders and contributed to the stalling of progress in the al-Bashir case by passing a non-cooperation policy that provided countries with a legal ‘out’ if they did not want to arrest a fellow African leader. Moreover, the organization called repeatedly for the deferral of cases and that sitting heads of state should be immune from prosecution. Third, I find that domestic-level factors help explain cooperation behavior. Most importantly, I argue that governments cooperate with the ICC when their interests are aligned with the Court; cooperation is not forthcoming or is undermined when the interests are misaligned. Moreover, reputation concerns can help explain cooperation decisions.The dissertation contributes to ongoing debates in International Relations (IR) on global governance, transitional justice norms, and compliance with International Law. The cooperation framework that I introduce expands on existing accounts of state cooperation with the ICC by including a wider array of state behaviors. While existing accounts either focus on mandatory cooperation or on political support for the ICC, I combine these behaviors into one framework. Beyond the ICC, this framework has the potential to travel to other international courts and organizations. Second, the crucial role of the AU in the state-ICC nexus challenges common accounts of Global South countries and the AU as weak actors in the international system. In the court cases against sitting heads of state, the AU’s involvement suggests that a regional organization can counteract a global institution’s work and purpose. Thus, when analyzing compliance, we need to expand our focus beyond domestic-level explanations to include regional actors that may impact compliance and create loyalty conflicts for states parties. The longitudinal analyses reveal that states can shift their cooperation behavior over time. This attests to the value added of in-depth case studies for our understanding of the temporal variation of compliance. It complicates existing compliance studies that analyze compliance through ratifications and domestic implementation of international treaties. These studies represent the compliance behavior of countries at a specific point in time but they cannot tell us about the degree to which a state will honor its legal commitment when called on to fulfill a specific task years or decades after the initial commitment. In addition, the empirical chapters add to the second image and second image reversed traditions in IR. On the one hand, the case studies show that these countries’ domestic politics can impact the functioning of an international organization. On the other hand, they contribute to our understanding of the ICC’s impact on domestic politics in South Africa and Kenya. Lastly, the dissertation attests to the formidable hurdles in prosecuting suspects of mass atrocities when those perpetrators are sitting heads of state. When equipped with the resources and powers of office, sitting leaders can easily circumvent international justice and might even be supported by important allies in their endeavors. This casts doubt on more optimistic accounts that posit an increasing trend toward accountability for all perpetrators."

The water-soluble organic salt in the system comprises of disodium cromoglycate  crystals that are emulsified by surfactants in water to form stable liquid crystal droplets. The work provides an exception to the rule of geometric packing factor that dictates formation of micelles by the surfactants in water.Chapter 2 shows that the odd or even number of carbon atoms present in the aliphatic chain of surfactants affect the ability of surfactants to emulsify aqueous-based liquid crystals of disodium cromoglycate. Such an odd-even effect is frequently observed for solid state properties like melting point, heat of fusion and refractive index but is rarely observed for molecules present in solution. When mixed in water, anionic single-chain surfactants with odd number of carbon atoms emulsifies disodium cromoglycate to form liquid crystal droplets, while surfactants with even number of carbon atoms fail to emulsify disodium cromoglycate.Chapter 3 Bolaamphiphiles usually form vesicles only in extreme conditions or in the presence of surfactants. Here, we explore the co-assembly system of synthesized bolaamphiphiles and disodium cromoglycate in water. The combination of the self-assembly forces of the bolaamphiphile and self-associating property of disodium cromoglycate liquid crystals act together at the interface form a unique microemulsion of liquid crystal droplets of disodium cromoglycate embedded in liquid crystal phase.Chapter 4 describes a key event (adhesion) that precedes infections caused by ""Candida albicans"". Adhesion of  ""C. albicans "" to a surface is a complex process and is governed by nonspecific attachment or multiple ligand-receptor interactions. The work demonstrates that the multiple ligand-receptor interactions used by ""C. albicans"" for adherence to a surface can be individually studied using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) decorated with minimal motif of the ligands. The SAMs were also used to differentiate between the interactions of the two different morphological forms of""C. albicans"".Chapter 5 presents a study on small molecules that were used to inhibit biofilm formed by ""C. albicans"". The acyclic triazoles used in the study were not toxic to the ""C. albicans"" and were capable of inhibiting biofilm formed by ""C. albicans"". The acyclic triazole can be used as promising candidates to design new antifungal agents.  The chapter also reports the synthesis of squarylated homoserine lactones (SHLs) structural mimics of bacterial acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to study the inhibitory effects of SHLs on fungal biofilm. The bacterial AHLs are known to repress the growth of ""C. albicans""and control fungal biofilm in native host environment. The synthesized SHLs were non-toxic to ""C. albicans""and failed to inhibit biofilm formed by ""C. albicans"".Chapter 6 uses gradient nanotopography combined with controlled surface chemistry to confine bacterial biofilm formed by "" Escherichia coli "". The ""E. coli ""  biofilm were confined within micrometer sized regions of hydrophobic SAMs surrounded by polyol-terminated SAMs. The study reveals that surface with higher topography enhances the ability of the bioinert SAMs to resist bacterial adherence to surface."
etd_700,Encounters with Authority: Tactics and negotiations at the periphery of participatory platforms,School of Information Studies,"Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Crowdsourcing, Human Computer Interaction, Newcomers, Peer production, Science and Technology Studies","Digital participatory platforms like Wikipedia are often celebrated as projects that allow anyone to contribute. Any user can sign up and start contributing immediately. Similarly, projects that engage volunteers in the production of scientific knowledge create easy points of entry to make contributions. These low barriers to entry are a hallmark feature in digital participatory labor, limiting the number of hoops a new volunteer has to jump through before they can feel like they are making a difference. Such low barriers to participation at the periphery, or edges of participatory platforms, have presented a problem for organizational scholars as they wonder how such projects can achieve consistent results when opportunities to train and socialize newcomers are constrained by a need for low barriers. As a result, scholarship has focused on answering the question of newcomer learning and socialization by examining how newcomers make sense of their new digital workspaces rather than focus on how institutional constraints are imposed. In this research, I draw on a growing body of scholarship that pushes against the perception of openness and low barriers on digital participatory platforms to unpack the constraints on participation that newcomers confront and, in particular, to show how such constraints resemble characteristics of institutionalized newcomer onboarding tactics.To approach this question, I conducted 18 months of participant observation and conducted 36 interviews with experts, newcomers, and project leaders from the crowdsourced citizen science platform Planet Hunters and the peer produced encyclopedia, Wikipedia. I analyzed my data using a grounded theory research design that is sensitized using the theoretical technology of Estrid Sørensen’s Forms of Presence as a way to pay attention to the sociomaterial configurations of newcomer practice, attending to the actors (both human and nonhuman) that play a part in the constraints and affordances of newcomer participation. By drawing on Sørensen’s Forms of Presence, the analytical focus on the newcomer experience shifts from looking at either top-down institutional tactics of organizations or bottom-up individual tactics of newcomers to thinking about the characteristics of relationships newcomers have with other members and platform features and the effects of these relationships as they relate to different opportunities for learning and participation. Focusing on the different ways that learning and participation are made available affords the exploration of how the authority of existing practices in particular settings are imposed on learners despite the presence of low barriers to participation.By paying attention to the sociomaterial configuration of newcomer participation, my findings unpack the tactics that newcomers encounter at the periphery, or edges of participatory platforms, as well as how they find their work being included or excluded from the platform. I use the findings to develop a taxonomy of encounters that describes how newcomers can participate in a self-guided experience as the existing literature describes, but also experience moments of guided and targeted encounters. What this taxonomy of encounters suggests is that the periphery of participatory platforms can be at once an open space for exploration and experimentation but also a well-managed space where, despite low barriers to initial participation, a newcomer must negotiate what I describe as the guardrails of participation that define the constraints and affordances that shape their experience."
etd_696,Endogenous RNAi pathways are required in neurons for dauer formation in Caenorhabditis elegans,Biology,"C. elegans, Dauer, Neurons, Pheromone, Stress","Animals can adapt to unfavorable environments through changes in physiology and behavior. For Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, environmental conditions perceived early in development determine whether the animal enters the reproductive cycle or enters into an alternative diapause stage called dauer. Here we demonstrate that endogenous RNA interference (endo-RNAi) pathways play a pivotal role early in the life cycle of worms in the detection of environmental conditions and mediating the appropriate developmental decisions. Our findings illustrate that functional endo-RNAi pathways contribute to the regulation of dauer formation in larvae when exposed to stress and recovery from the dauer stage when the conditions improve. Our experiments demonstrate that disruption of the Mutator proteins or the nuclear argonaute CSR-1 result in differential dauer-deficient phenotypes that are dependent upon the environmental stress. We found that these RNAi components function in individual neurons upstream of TGF-? and insulin signal transduction pathways to positively regulate G protein genes that are required to make dauer formation decision, suggesting a role for the distributed neuronal circuit in regulating this decision. Our results also suggest that endo-RNAi governs dauer recovery decisions in pheromone induced dauers when conditions are favorable. Together, our data suggest a model wherein the CSR-1 pathway promotes expression of genes required for the detection and signaling of environmental conditions, and highlight a mechanism whereby RNAi pathways mediate the link between environmental stress and adaptive phenotypic plasticity in animals."
etd_178,ENDURING TERRITORIAL DISPUTE OVER THE NORTHERN LIMIT LINE(NLL) BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS IN THE WEST SEA OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA,Political Science,"Diplomatic and military confrontation, Foreign policy behavior, Territorial Dispute, The Korean Peninsula, The Northern Limit Line, The two Koreas","This paper seeks to answer the following questions: What are the conditions which either promote relatively peaceful relations or prompt the escalation of hostile diplomatic and military confrontations over the NLL (Northern Limit Line) between the two Koreas? More specifically, what are the conditions which have led North Korea, as a contender state that is dissatisfied with the current status quo of the NLL, to engage in high versus low levels of diplomatic and military confrontation over the NLL in the West Sea of the Korean Peninsula? Even though the two Koreas have been embroiled in an enduring dispute over the NLL for more than half a century, their relations over the NLL have not always been characterized by competitive and hostile interactions. Relations between the two Koreas over the NLL have been characterized by relatively stable and peaceful periods with low levels of diplomatic and military confrontation as well as relatively hostile periods featuring high levels of diplomatic and military confrontation.This thesis is an effort to understand the dispute over the NLL from a more theoretical and practical perspective. For this purpose, it explores the conditions which make the territorial dispute over the NLL enduring. It also attempts to differentiate between the conditions which trigger North Korea as a contender state to pursue relatively stable and peaceful relations and those that prompt it to pursue territorial claims in an aggressive and confrontational manner. I examine whether North Korea's unfavorable external environment affects its threat perception which in turn motivates North Korea to send signals via challenging foreign policies. Since the end of the Korean War, the United States and South Korea have constituted the main external threats to North Korea. In this context, this thesis explores how the US and South Korean foreign policies toward North Korea have affected the diplomatic and military behavior of North Korea over the NLL during three South Korean administrations: Kim Daejung from 1998-2002, Roh Moohyn from 2003-2007, and Lee Myungbak from 2008-2012.For this purpose, this study conducts a plausibility probe to test the validity of the proposition that there is a positive correlation between North Korea's threat perception and its use of escalatory or challenging foreign policies against perceived threats. I conclude that the plausibility probe in this study justifies the utility of further systemic research using similar cases. Additionally, given these findings this study argues that North Korea's foreign policy behavior is logical and coherent rather than irrational."
etd_97,"ENERGY-EFFICIENT LIGHTWEIGHT ALGORITHMS FOR EMBEDDED SMART CAMERAS: DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Adaptive tracking, Background subtraction, Device drivers, Feedback tracking, Hardware-level operations, Middleware","An embedded smart camera is a stand-alone unit that not only captures images, but also includes a processor, memory and communication interface. Battery-powered, embedded smart cameras introduce many additional challenges since they have very limited resources, such as energy, processing power and memory. When camera sensors are added to an embedded system, the problem of limited resources becomes even more pronounced. Hence, computer vision algorithms running on these camera boards should be light-weight and efficient. This thesis is about designing and developing computer vision algorithms, which are aware and successfully overcome the limitations of embedded platforms (in terms of power consumption and memory usage). Particularly, we are interested in object detection and tracking methodologies and the impact of them on the performance and battery life of the CITRIC camera (embedded smart camera employed in this research). This thesis aims to prolong the life time of the Embedded Smart platform, without affecting the reliability of the system during surveillance tasks. Therefore, the reader is walked through the whole designing process, from the development and simulation, followed by the implementation and optimization, to the testing and performance analysis. The work presented in this thesis carries out not only software optimization, but also hardware-level operations during the stages of object detection and tracking. The performance of the algorithms introduced in this thesis are comparable to state-of-the-art object detection and tracking methods, such as Mixture of Gaussians, Eigen segmentation, color and coordinate tracking. Unlike the traditional methods, the newly-designed algorithms present notable reduction of the memory requirements, as well as the reduction of memory accesses per pixel. To accomplish the proposed goals, this work attempts to interconnect different levels of the embedded system architecture to make the platform more efficient in terms of energy and resource savings. Thus, the algorithms proposed are optimized at the API, middleware, and hardware levels to access the pixel information of the CMOS sensor directly. Only the required pixels are acquired in order to reduce the unnecessary communications overhead. Experimental results show that when exploiting the architecture capabilities of an embedded platform, 41.24% decrease in energy consumption, and 107.2% increase in battery-life can be accomplished. Compared to traditional object detection and tracking methods, the proposed work provides an additional 8 hours of continuous processing on 4 AA batteries, increasing the lifetime of the camera to 15.5 hours."

It studies the colonial exigencies of institutionalization of medical education and treatment in the light of an absence of a legal mandate to rule India. Related to this, I study how the discipline of surgery was reconfigured in the context of its elaboration as an idiom of governing the bodies of the native subjects. Moreover, I explore how vernacularization of medical knowledge and practice within British bureaucratic disciplinary norms of service and charity led the native doctors of the nineteenth century to reclaim trust between the patient and the medic in idioms, which contested the very legitimacy of British rule in India."

However, there are questions remaining about the long term benefits of activities and how many residents participate. “RenewedMe” is a service design project with the goal of “Enhancing engagement in individuals with cognitive or physical decline through multi-sensory activities. This project was inspired by the Montessori method principles of education that foster development, engagement and relationships through developmentally appropriate activities. My approach was to create an “environment” that fosters/sustains individualism, builds confidence and sensorial input and output. An array of activities was used to encourage engagement among residents of nursing homes and also between caregivers and friends. By playfully stimulating cognitive and emotional skills, these activities challenged individuals with cognitive decline. This research draws upon a mixture of primary and secondary sources including research, books and primary field research.Engagement in meaningful social activities is related to quality of life for individuals in assistive care environments. “RenewedMe” aims not to discredit the works of recreational coordinators in assistive care environments. Rather, its objective is to assist in generating better systems to develop more inclusive, interactive and individualized activities that are cognitively beneficial."
etd_725,Enhancing survivability and reliability in the cloud,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"Cloud computing has evolved as an important distributed computing model, enabling infrastructure, information, and software to be used as shared resources over the network in an on-demand manner. A complex cloud computing system is a large-scale network which may include multiple Data Centers (DCs) that are distributed all over the world. Given a large number of connected servers across the whole planet, server and network failures are inevitable. Meanwhile, the power-demanding nature of data centers urges us to allocate existing resources efficiently, instead of simply adding more servers, to enhance the reliability. It is meaningful to study how to build survivable and reliable cloud computing systems while maximizing power efficiency.In this dissertation, we first studied survivable Virtual Machine (VM) management by proposing a general optimization framework, designing a polynomial-time optimal algorithm and an efficient heuristic algorithm for virtual link mapping and VM placement subproblems respectively, as well as designing an effective algorithm to solve the two subproblems jointly.  We reduced the reserved bandwidth by at least 96% and yielded comparable results in terms of the number of active servers against the first fit decreasing and single shortest path-based baseline algorithm in the simulation.We also studied the reliable VM management problem and proposed the first Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)-based continuous-time and event-driven resource allocation framework that combines a deep neural network with autoencoder and novel weight sharing structure, and an online deep Q-learning framework to handle high-dimensional state space. Simulation results showed that our DRL-based solution reduced the server power consumption by least 47% with minor job latency increases in generating reliable VM placement, compared with the round-robin baseline algorithm.Moreover, we studied reliable VM management in distributed DCs by formulating Virtual Server Provisioning and Selection (VSPS) as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and proposing a novel optimization framework, under which we developed a polynomial-time ln(N)-approximation algorithm, along with a heuristic algorithm which jointly solves sub-problems of the VSPS. Simulation results showed that our algorithms provide close-to-optimal performance and achieve 25% or more cost reduction compared to a baseline algorithm.Finally, we studied the reliability enhancement for Distributed Stream Data Processing Systems (DSDPSs) and designed a predictive DSDPS control framework which consists a two-tiered Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) model with consideration on co-location interference and implementing dynamic grouping for misbehaving workers bypassing. In addition, we implemented and tested our framework over a well-known DSDPS Storm and showed that our DRNN model outperformed AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in terms of prediction accuracy, and that our framework introduced minor performance degradation when misbehaving workers exist."
mae_etd_76,Enriching Step-Based Product Information Models to Support Product Life-Cycle Activities,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Compliance management, Information modeling, ISO 10303, Semantic representation, STEP, Tolerance analysis","The representation and management of product information in its life-cycle requires standardized data exchange protocols. Standard for Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP) is such a standard that has been used widely by the industries. Even though STEP-based product models are well defined and syntactically correct, populating product data according to these models is not easy because they are too big and disorganized. Data exchange specifications (DEXs) and templates provide re-organized information models required in data exchange of specific activities for various businesses. DEXs show us it would be possible to organize STEP-based product models in order to support different engineering activities at various stages of product life-cycle. In this study, STEP-based models are enriched and organized to support two engineering activities: materials information declaration and tolerance analysis. Due to new environmental regulations, the substance and materials information in products have to be screened closely by manufacturing industries. This requires a fast, unambiguous and complete product information exchange between the members of a supply chain. Tolerance analysis activity, on the other hand, is used to verify the functional requirements of an assembly considering the worst case (i.e., maximum and minimum) conditions for the part/assembly dimensions.Another issue with STEP-based product models is that the semantics of product data are represented implicitly. Hence, it is difficult to interpret the semantics of data for different product life-cycle phases for various application domains. OntoSTEP, developed at NIST, provides semantically enriched product models in OWL. In this thesis, we would like to present how to interpret the GD & T specifications in STEP for tolerance analysis by utilizing OntoSTEP."

Theories of entrepreneurial behavior have assumed that entrepreneurs try to achieve goals--profit, sales, job satisfaction, autonomy, to name a few. Yet, past studies are silent about how entrepreneurs keep making efforts toward business startups while not achieving goals for a prolonged period of time. If goals are hard to reach and entrepreneurs are unable to assess their achievement level toward their goals, how do they manage to keep making efforts during the business startup process? What factors influence their effort level during the startup? Based on individual entrepreneurs' daily records, this thesis suggests that entrepreneurs manipulate their affective states through their behavior thus are able to keep engaged in startup despite high uncertainty about their goals and achievement levels. I analyze individual entrepreneurs' behavior, emotions, and perceptions as the uncertain future unfolds for them. By using research methods that avoid recollection bias, I present a model as to how entrepreneurs' behavior and their affective states are interrelated, and what triggers entrepreneurs to increase or decrease their effort toward business startups. This study contributes to the further understanding of entrepreneurial behavior by suggesting alternative drivers of entrepreneurial processes: happiness and contentment."
etd_649,Equal Access DENIED: Empowered Voices of Students with Physical Disabilities in New York City Public Schools,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Accessibility, Disability, Equality, Inclusion, Marginalization, Oppression","In New York City, of the 435 public high schools, one hundred percent are built for the privileged or temporarily able-bodied population, while only nine percent of those schools are fully accessible to students, teachers, administrators, and parents with mobility-related disabilities. This dissertation explores the self-reported lived experiences of 12 New York City public high school students. Through open-ended interviewing and the technique of mapping, students share their daily route through school as well as their stories of physical and social access and the barriers that they encounter. Areas examined include bus transportation, entering the building, getting around the hallways, using the elevators and accessible bathrooms, participating in classrooms and eating in the cafeteria. Many of the physical barriers in these spaces directly connect to the social barriers that students experience each day. Also explored were the various physical and policy-related obstacles that create an architecture of exclusion in schools, which often works to marginalize, oppress, and stigmatize students with physical disabilities. Finally, I discuss the various methods that students with physical disabilities use to respond to the systems of oppression in school. These include downplaying disability to fit in as “normal,” giving up and not questioning authority/rules, and self-advocacy/self-assertions of independence. Implications for school policy and increasing opportunities for student self-advocacy are discussed as well as recommendations for practice for paraprofessionals, teachers and administrators in schools."
etd_680,Essays in Corporate Finance,Business Administration,"Bayesian Learning, Boards of Directors, Corporate Governance, Directors' and Officers' liability insurance, Private Equity","This dissertation consists of three chapters in corporate finance and private equity. Chapter 1, “Incentives of Private Equity General Partners from Future Fundraising”, co-authored with Ji-Woong Chung, Berk Sensoy and Michael Weisbach, studies the incentives of private equity general partners (GPs). Lifetime incomes of GPs are affected by their current funds’ performance not only directly, through carried interest profit-sharing provisions, but also indirectly by the effect of the current fund’s performance on GP’s abilities to raise capital for future funds. In the context of a rational learning model, which we show better matches the empirical relations between future fundraising and current performance than behavioral alternatives, we estimate that indirect pay for performance from future fundraising is of the same order of magnitude as direct pay for performance from carried interest. Consistent with the learning framework, indirect pay for performance is stronger when managerial abilities are more scalable and weaker when current performance is less informative about ability. Specifically, it is stronger for buyout funds than for venture capital funds, and declines in the sequence of a partnership’s funds. Total pay for performance in private equity is both considerably larger and much more heterogeneous than implied by the carried interest alone. Our framework can be adapted to estimate indirect pay for performance in other asset management settings.Uncertainty is ubiquitous in financial markets, and market participants form expectations and learn about parameters, which may be the ability of general partners or the quality of a firm’s governance structure. Assessing the quality of a firm's governance is valuable, which might explain the recent growth of the governance industry. Yet, governance indices have been criticized by researchers and practitioners alike, mainly on the grounds of overlooking firms' heterogeneity and their specific governance needs. Chapter 2, “D&O; Insurance and IPO Performance: what can we learn from insurers?”, co-authored with Martin Boyer, provides new insights into the ability of directors’ and officers’ (D&O;) insurers to price risk, and in particular risk related to governance characteristics. Therefore, learning by investors about governance quality could be facilitated by providing investors with a market-based assessment of governance as reflected in the D&O; insurance premium. We investigate whether a firm’s D&O; liability insurance contract at the time of the IPO is related to insured firms’ first year post-IPO performance. We find that insurers charge a higher premium per dollar of coverage to protect the directors and officers of firms that will subsequently have poor first year post-IPO stock performance. A higher price of coverage is also associated with a higher post-IPO volatility and lower Sharpe ratio. Our results are robust to various econometric specifications and suggest that even when the high level of information asymmetry inherent to the IPO context prevails, insurers have information about the firms’ prospects that should be valuable to outside investors.In Chapter 3, “A Learning-Based Approach to Evaluating Boards of Directors”, I develop a general framework based on a theoretical model of learning to assess how investors react to the appointment of new directors. Using predictions from a learning model, this chapter exploits the cross-sectional variation in the learning-induced decline in stock return volatility over director tenure to infer the marginal value of different kinds of directors. This new framework confirms prior empirical findings and documents new results. For example, directors joining better compensated boards have higher marginal value while the marginal value of a director joining an entrenched board is muted. Furthermore, the estimates imply that governance related uncertainty associated with the arrival of a new director accounts for 7% of return volatility, shedding light on the extent to which governance matters."
ecn_etd_97,Essays on Academic Achievement and Student Behavior in Public Schools,Economics,"High School Graduation, School Starting Age, Student Achievement, Student Behavior","This dissertation examines the student academic achievement through various mechanisms, put in place by the public school district, classroom student behavior, and negative external shocks to the students' living environment. I examine the impacts of various treatments on student short and long run academic outcomes such as math and English test scores, grade retention, special education diagnoses, as well as high school graduation. Each essay will be presented as a chapter of the dissertation.The first essay uses student-level administrative data from New York City Public Schools to examine the impacts of school entry age on student academic outcomes (including test scores and high school graduation) and behavioral outcomes (such as suspensions and chronic absenteeism) for students in grades three through ten. My research design uses exogenous variation in students' month of birth, comparing the outcomes of students born just before to students born just after the school starting age cutoff date. I present evidence that entering school early increases the probability of high school graduation, among white, black, and Hispanic students. Starting school early has no effect on suspensions and chronic absenteeism. I find that starting school early has a negative effect on grade specific measures such as, test scores, GPA, retention, and special education.The second essay uses exogenous variation on course scheduling in Chicago Public Schools to examine empirical implications of Lazear's (2001) educational production model. This essay investigates an underlying mechanism by which class size affects student performance, the behavioral composition of a classroom. Behavioral composition is defined as the number of non-disruptive students who are in attendance on a given school day, where attendance is not randomly assigned. To properly identify the effect of classroom behavioral composition, we use random course scheduling to instrument for non-random attendance throughout the school day. Consistent with the Lazear framework, we find that an additional non-disruptive student in attendance increases the probability of passing English I and Algebra I, with larger effects for students in remedial versus regular classes. For regular English I students, we estimate a positive relationship between the number of non-disruptive students in attendance and own reading test score.The final essay examines the impacts of the events following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 where animosity geared towards the Arab community increased significantly. Specifically, we analyze the performance of Arab students in New York City public schools pre and post the terrorist attacks and compare the effects to non-Arab Muslim as well as Indian students in the same schools. We analyze the impacts of September 11 on the student achievement of Arab students enrolled in grades 3 through 8. We use a difference-in-differences approach using non-Arab Muslim students as a control group. We find that Arab students experience a decline in their scholastic performance post-9/11 by as much as 0.077 and 0.101 student level standard deviations in ELA and math test scores, respectively. We also find that retention and special education rates among Arab students post-9/11, increase by 62.8 and 16.8 percent, respectively."
ecn_etd_101,"Essays on Agglomeration, Access To Medical Services, And the Real Estate Market",Economics,"Agglomeration, Health Care, Input Sharing, Real Estate","This dissertation comprises three papers that study how external economies of scale help to explain geographic variation in access to medical services as well as potential implications on the real estate market. Specifically, the first two papers examine whether an increased concentration of the hospital service industry promotes productivity in treating patients and if so, what are the specific channels through which agglomeration economies might take place in the health care industry. The third paper explores how the productivity variation is reflected in the real estate market.Chapter 2 examines two factors that help to explain geographic variation in health outcomes. The first factor concerns proximity to medical services. The second factor is state-specific health care policy that may impede access to nearby medical services. Three key findings are obtained. First, the effect of local doctors on reducing mortality rates of various diseases in a county attenuates with distance. Second, at approximately the same distance, in-state doctors contribute more to lowering mortality rates in the primary county than do out-of-state doctors. Third, the lesser impact of nearby out-of-state doctors is amplified when the primary state adopts more stringent policies that restrict entry of out-of-state physicians. This evidence is consistent with labor market pooling as one of the specific channels through which agglomeration economies affect productivity.Chapter 3 addresses two related questions that help to explain geographic variation in access to medical services. The first question examines the existence of agglomeration economies in the hospital service industry. The second considers whether the sharing of intermediate inputs contributes to spillovers from spatial concentration of hospital services. Three key findings are obtained. First, hospitals in more concentrated areas are more likely to outsource intermediate services to specialized intermediate service suppliers. This suggests that agglomeration economies exist in the hospital service industry and are generated in part through the sharing of intermediate inputs. Second, the presence of nearby small hospitals increases the tendency to outsource, consistent with a ""Chinitz"" effect identified elsewhere in the literature. Third, the agglomeration effect attenuates geographically.Chapter 4 replicates and extends a paper by Holly, Pesaran, and Yamagata (2010). Their paper uses a panel of 49 states over the period of 1975 to 2003 to show that state-level real housing prices are driven by economic fundamentals, such as real per capita disposable income, as well as by common shocks, such as changes in interest rates, oil prices, and technological change. They apply the common correlated effects (CCE) estimator of Pesaran (2006) which takes into account spatial interactions that reflect both geographical proximity and unobserved common factors. This chapter replicates their results using a panel of 384 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) observed over the period of 1975 to 2010. Our replication shows that their results are fairly robust to the more geographically refined cross-section units, and to the updated period of study."
ecn_etd_100,"Essays on Agglomeration, Homeownership, and Labor Market Outcomes",Economics,"agglomeration economies, homeownership, labor market pooling, number of children, volatility of hours worked","This dissertation consists of two essays on the labor market impact of agglomeration economies and that of homeownership. The empirical analyses use different U.S. data and econometric techniques to examine the impact on different labor market outcomes such as volatility of hours worked and men's employment.The first essay is motivated by the labor market pooling model from Krugman (1991). The paper adds to a small but important literature that provides evidence on the microeconomic foundation of agglomeration economies. Using various years of data from the American Community Survey and the County Business Patterns survey, I show that the agglomeration of economic activities reduces the volatility of hours worked. Drawing on Krugman's model, I argue that this implies that labor pooling contributes to agglomeration economies, and helps to explain why cities are productive places.In the second essay, I consider the extent to which homeownership affects men's labor supply. Research on the labor-supply consequences of homeownership is complicated by the endogeneity of housing tenure status. To address this endogeneity problem, I use a set of family size instruments (the presence of the third and additional children in a single family household) to estimate the effect of homeownership in a bivariate probit model. Based on a sample of married white male household heads from the American Community Survey, the IV result suggests that men who own their homes are 1.2% more likely to be employed relative to those who rent. I also show that the relationship between homeownership and family size is highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic. The first two children have positive influence on both homeownership and men's employment. The third and additional children are negatively associated with homeownership but have no significant incremental effects on men's labor supply."
etd_462,Essays on Characterizing Inefficiency for Stochastic Frontier Models,Economics,"Dirac Delta, Ordinary Least Squares, production, skewness, Stochastic Frontier","This dissertation consists of three essays on stochastic frontier models in characterizing inefficiency for a cross section of firms in essays one and three and a set of firms overtime in essay two. The first essay looks at stationary points for several models used in stochastic frontier analysis. The second essay extends the multivariate probability statements of Horrace (2005) to calculate the probability that a firm is any particular efficiency rank. These rank probabilities are used to calculate expected efficiency ranks for each firm. The third and final essay adds spatial correlation to the production function of each firm and generalizes the Horrace (2005) probability statements.The skew of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) residuals of the composed error is expected to be negative and positive for a production function and a cost function, respectively. However, because of sampling errors in empirical applications, modelers may get a positive skew for a production function and this has serious implication for Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) – this is called the “wrong skew problem”. Waldman (1982) shows that for the normal-half normal model if the wrong skew occurs then (1) MLEs reduce to OLS, (2) this solution is stable, and (3) there is a relationship between the skew of OLS residuals and the MLE of the pretruncated variance of inefficiency. In the literature two solutions are provided when the wrong skew occurs; (1) find a new random sample, however this might be too costly and (2) respecify the distribution of inefficiency.The first essay generalizes part 1 of Waldman (1982) result using the theory of the Dirac measure (Dirac, 1930). This essay shows that if the inefficiency distribution converges to a Dirac delta function when the pretruncated variance of the inefficiency distribution goes to zero, the likelihood of the composed error will converge to a likelihood based solely on the noise distribution. In particular this essay shows that if the Dirac delta function is centered at zero then the maximum likelihood estimator equals the ordinary least squares estimator in the limit. The parameters of the inefficiency distribution are not identified in the limit. Stability of the maximum likelihood estimator and the “wrong skew” results are derived or simulated for common parametric assumptions on the inefficiency distribution. This essay shows that the full suite of Waldman (1982) result holds for the normal-doubly truncated normal and the normal-truncated normal models when the pretruncated mean is non-positive. Simulation results show that if the wrong skew occurs the MLEs for the normal-doubly truncated normal (when the upper bound B, B>2? where ? is the pretruncated mean), the normal-truncated normal and the normal-exponential models reduce to OLS.  A cost function with the wrong skew of OLS residuals is estimated using the Greene’s Airline data and the results show that the normal-truncated normal and the normal-exponential models reduce to OLS. Overall the results reveal that respecifying using the traditional assumptions for the inefficiency distribution is unnecessary if the wrong skew of OLS residuals occurs.Empirical applications of frontier analysis are abundant ranging from the Airline industry to the farming industry, see Battese and Coelli (1995; 1992), Druska and Horrace (2004) and Almanidis, Qian and Sickles (2014). In empirical applications a modeler typically proceeds by estimating a Cobb-Douglas production function or a cost function for a set of firms. For a production function output is proxy by the total sales deflated by a price index. Inputs include all the factors of production such as land, labor and capital. The first step is to estimate OLS since it provides consistent estimates for all the parameters except the intercept or Corrected Ordinary Least Squares (COLS) which is OLS corrected for the biased intercept. The next step is to examine the skew (the third central moment) of OLS residuals before proceeding to MLE which is more efficient than OLS. The skew has important information so it is used as a guideline for empiricists as to how to proceed in applications. If the skew has the correct sign (negative for a production function) empiricists proceed to MLE. If the skew has the wrong sign (positive for a production function) empiricists respecify the distribution for inefficiency. This first essay shows that in empirical applications if a modeler encounters the wrong skew respecifying using the normal-truncated or the normal-exponential model is a futile procedure since these models do not provide any new results.The second essay extends the multivariate probability statements of Horrace (2005) to calculate the conditional probability that a firm is any particular efficiency rank in a sample. Conditional expected efficiency ranks are constructed for each firm, in particular, it can be determined which firm in the sample is the best, 2nd best,…., 2nd  worst and worst in the population of firms. Firm level conditional expected efficiency ranks are more informative about the degree of uncertainty in regards to ranking when compared to the traditional ranked efficiency point estimates. A Monte Carlo study reveals that under low skew the expected efficiency rank provides inferential insights which the traditional conditional mean function would not uncover.The MLEs of the parameters (under the assumption that there are no estimation errors or parameters uncertainty) post estimation are substituted into the conditional mean function. The conditional mean function is the mean of inefficiency conditioned on the composed error and is used to produce estimates for inefficiencies for each firm in the sample, see Jondrow, Lovell, Materov and Schmidt (1982). The probability statements utilize both the first and the second moments which provide a more accurate description of the distribution inefficiency. In empirical applications to determine which firm is any efficiency rank the modeler substitutes MLEs into the probability statements (inefficiency conditioned on the composed error) and simulates the probabilities. The firm with the largest probability is interpreted as the best firm in the sample and the firm with the smallest probability is interpreted as the worst firm in the sample. Thereafter the modeler uses these conditional probabilities to compute the expected efficiency rank, such that the firm with the largest value of the expected efficiency rank is deemed the least efficient or ranked the worst and the firm with the smallest value is ranked as the most efficient or the best firm in the sample.The third essay generalizes the Horrace (2005) probability statements to account for spatial correlation in the unobservable for a cross section of firms. This essay relaxes the assumption of independence on the noise or signal or both noise and signal distributions. This essay makes two assumptions on the inefficiency (signal) distribution, (1) inefficiency is assumed to be truncated from a normal distribution prior to the addition of spatial correlation and (2) inefficiency is drawn from a normal distribution and then truncated. The addition of spatial correlation to the production function results in the likelihood being intractable as the number of integrals increases with the sample size. This essay uses sequential conditioning by Spanos (1986; 1999) to factor the joint distribution into the product of a marginal and univariate conditional distributions to compute the probability of the least and most efficient firm. Unlike Horrace (2005) if inefficiency is assumed to be spatially correlated, the conditional distribution of inefficiency conditioned on the composed error is not needed to compute the probabilities. The MLEs are substituted directly into the probability statements. This is because spatial dependence induces heteroskedascity that results in variation across the firms. Overall this essay provides some insights to empiricists in making inference when the assumption of independence on the noise and inefficiency distributions is relaxed.The presence of spatial correlation in the errors shifts the production function outward or inward. The composed error is not random because firms are locating in specific areas due to easier access to specialized workers which reduces the search cost of matching workers to the appropriate firms. Furthermore firms will locate in places where there are more favorable demand conditions, similar cultural practices, bureaucratic organization, work ethics and economic activities. Having better access to inputs will affect the productivity of a given firm, however these activities are not observed by the econometrician. These activities affect efficiency and need to be accounted for empirically to provide a better characterization of inefficiency. The spatial correlation is captured using a prespecified weighted matrix. There are several ways of determining the weights. For instance, a modeler could employ contiguity weights or use an inverse distance function. The inverse distance function means that firms further away from each other will impact each other less.  These weights are typically known prior to estimation. The weighted matrix is added to the production function before estimation begins. Post estimation MLEs or COLS are substituted into the probability statements developed in Horrace (2005), in which the modeler will be able to compute the probability that firm i is the least or most efficient firm in the sample."
ecn_etd_102,Essays on Estimation and Inference for Spatial Economic Models,Economics,"Econometrics, Spatial Models","This dissertation consists of two essays on the estimation and inference for spatial economic models. The first essay discusses the estimation for a simultaneous system of spatial autoregressive equations with random effects in panel data setting. I suggest an error component three-stage least squares (EC3SLS) estimator for the model. The second essay focuses on the estimation and inference for a threshold spatial autoregressive model for cross sections. I propose a spatial two-stage least square (S2SLS) estimator for the model and prove the consistency of the threshold parameter estimator.The first essay derives a 3SLS estimator for a simultaneous system of spatial autoregressive equations with random effects which can therefore handle endogeneity, spatial lag dependence, heterogeneity as well as cross equation correlation. This is done by utilizing the Kelejian and Prucha (1998) and Lee (2003) type instruments from the cross-section spatial autoregressive literature and marrying them to the error components 3SLS estimator derived by Baltagi (1981) for a system of simultaneous panel data equations. The Monte Carlo experiments indicate that, for the single equation spatial error components 2SLS estimators, there is a slight gain in efficiency when Lee (2003) type rather than Kelejian and Prucha (1998) instruments are used. However, there is not much difference in efficiency between these instruments for spatial error components 3SLS estimators.The second essay extends the threshold model to the spatial framework. This allows different spatial lag coefficients for different regimes (subsamples), while the sample splitting point is unknown. We suggest a spatial two-stage least squares (S2SLS) estimator for the threshold and slope parameters based on Kelejian and Prucha (1998) type instruments. We also prove the consistency of the threshold parameter estimator. A Monte Carlo study is provided to examine the finite sample properties. Our results show that the performance of our estimator improves as the sample size increases and as the difference between the spatial parameters of the two subsamples increases."
etd_652,Essays on Global Sourcing under Uncertainty,Supply Chain Management,,"In this dissertation, we study the sourcing policies of global corporations and determine the key drivers of the procurement decisions under different types of uncertainties.The first essay explores the impact of exchange-rate and demand uncertainty on sourcing decisions of a multinational firm which engages in global sourcing through capacity reservation contracts. The focus of this essay is cost, which is known to be the main driver of global sourcing practices. We investigate the impact of cost uncertainty caused by exchange-rate fluctuations on procurement decisions, and identify the conditions that result in single and dual sourcing policies. Our analysis indicates that although cost is an order qualifier when exchange rate is considered deterministic, lower expected sourcing cost is neither necessary nor sufficient to source from a supplier under exchange-rate uncertainty.The second essay examines sourcing and pricing decisions of an agricultural processor encountering yield uncertainty of the agricultural input required for its offered specialty product and the price uncertainty of the competing commercial product. We show that uncertainty gives rise to a conservative sourcing policy which would never emerge in a deterministic setting.While both studies highlight the significant impact of uncertainty on the business decisions and performance, they demonstrate that the effect of uncertainty may take opposite directions contingent upon the business environment and the type of uncertainty. The operational environment studied in the first essay, provides an opportunity for the firm to benefit from exchange-rate fluctuations, whereas the variation in supply and the market price of the competing product are shown to diminish the firm’s expected profit in the agricultural setting studied in the second essay. Demonstrating the opposing behavior under different forms of uncertainty, this study recommends managers to think deeply about the impact of uncertainty on their businesses. It also provides various forms of prescriptions to mitigate risk and operate effectively under each uncertainty."
ecn_etd_98,Essays on Health and Medical Care,Economics,"Health Care, Medicaid, Temporary Aid to Needy Families","This dissertation consists of two essays that explain health outcomes and medical care in the United States. Health care has been a major concern of economists and policy makers. Policy intervention is one of the key factors that affect health outcomes, especially among low-income families. Welfare programs such as Medicaid and cash assistance are conventionally implemented to assist low-income families. The effectiveness of these efforts to improve health outcomes and medical utilization among low-income families is not entirely clear. As to the supply side of health care, the results of previous studies on how hospitals provide the services are mixed. Additionally, hospitals may compete to attract patients and generate spillover effects. Quality of hospitals may in turn differ by market. My two essays apply econometrics models to investigate the effects of public policies and hospital quality on health and medical care. Specifically, the first essay examines whether welfare programs affect the health outcomes and medical utilization of children in the low-income families, and if so, which policy has the strongest effect on them. The second essay explores how the spillover effects impact the treatment rates of hospitals.The first essay examines the effect of the Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) program on children's health outcomes using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) over the period 1994 to 2005. The TANF policies have been credited with increased employment for single mothers and a dramatic drop in welfare caseload. Our results show that these policies also had a significant effect on various measures of children's health and medical utilization especially among low-income families. These health measures include a rating of the child's health status reported by the parents; the number of days an illness or injury kept the child in bed; the number of times that parents consulted a doctor; and the number of nights that the child stayed in a hospital.The second essay addresses the effect of hospital ownership on treatment rates allowing for spatial correlation among hospitals. Competition among hospitals and knowledge spillovers generate significant externalities which we try to capture using the spatial Durbin model. Using a panel of 2342 hospitals in the 48 continental states observed over the period 2005 to 2008, we find significant spatial correlation of medical service treatment rates among hospitals. We also get mixed results on the effect of hospital ownership on treatment rates that depends upon the market structure where the hospital is located and which varies by treatment type."
etd_219,Essays on International Trade and Development,Economics,"Firm Boundaries, Global Sourcing, Offshoring, Wage Inequality","This dissertation consists of three essays. Using firm-level data from Korea, the first and second chapter examine Korean firms' offshoring strategies and the impact of these offshoring activities on firm-level employment in Korea. In the third chapter, the recent pattern of wage inequality is decomposed using an individual-level Korean labor income survey. This dissertation finds the role of industry capital intensity and firm productivity in the differential choices of global sourcing such as vertical FDI and foreign outsourcing. Also, this dissertation finds that input substitutability and firm exports can affect the impact of offshoring on firms' domestic labor demand. Finally, this dissertation finds various workers' characteristics that have affected wage inequality across various quartiles."
etd_376,Essays on Local Political Economy in Brazil and the United States,Social Sciences,"Brazil, fiscal policy, local government, political economy, political institutions, public budgeting","This dissertation covers different aspects of political institutions and fiscal policy in local governments.  The first essay examines the political consequences of an increase in the district magnitude (the number of open seats) for legislatures.  The second essay studies how the size of a local legislature affects the size and composition of public spending.  The third essay develops and tests a theory of how transaction costs might affect the use of earmarked revenues by local budgeting authorities.  The last essay compares the relative impacts of factors that might make a local government more likely to adopt own-source revenues.  These questions are examined in the context of Brazilian and US local governments.  Individual chapter abstracts follow.Chapter 1: Research has consistently identified district magnitude as an important institutional factor in political competition.  The most familiar of these formulations is Duverger’s hypothesis, which argues that district magnitude affects the number of parties and legislative fragmentation among parties. Yet parties play little to no role in structuring political competition in some polities.  How might Duverger’s rule apply in the absence of meaningful parties?  Using the case of Brazilian municipalities, this paper estimates the influence of changes in district magnitude on alternative conceptions of political competition – the number of personalist political coalitions and opposition strength.  Results indicate that large changes in district magnitude had a positive but minimal effect on the number of coalitions in government.  The most consequential result of a larger district magnitude was a strengthened opposition, which increased its numbers.  Evidence from fieldwork suggests that larger city councils in Brazil may be more autonomous from the executive and engender a better check on executive power.Chapter 2. Many factors contribute to the size and composition of public spending.  Research that examines the role of legislature size has traditionally focused on political systems where the legislature has budgeting authority, and higher expenditures emerge as a result of logrolling.  This paper develops an alternate view of legislature size and expenditures for a political system where an independent executive holds the budgeting authority and must spend fiscal resources to maintain his or her legislative coalition. I examine the theory in the context of Brazilian municipalities.  Results indicate that larger legislatures led to higher public spending.  An average municipality that expanded from 10 to 15 legislators in 2013 spent 3% to 4% more than a similarly situated municipality that maintained 10 legislators.  This equals R$400k per year, or 65 minimum wage jobs, per additional legislator.  There was an appreciable increase in urban infrastructure spending, while education expenditures did not change systematically in response to larger local councils.  The overall increase and the pattern of the increase are consistent with the notion that Brazilian mayors use public spending to build and maintain their legislative coalitions, and that they must appropriate more public funds to achieve these goals when the legislature is larger.Chapter 3. The question of whether earmarked public revenues are spent on their intended purpose has a long history in the academic literature. Theory suggests that earmarks should not matter since budget authorities can always shuffle money between accounts. However, empirical studies often find that much of marginal earmarked revenue is spent overwhelmingly on its intended purpose. There are many theories for this outcome, and this paper adds one more to the literature: transaction costs in the budgeting process.  When transaction costs are low, governments optimize between expenditure categories.  When the costs are high, the earmarked funds are spent exclusively on their intended purpose.  Further development of this theory suggests governments that are highly reliant on earmarked revenues will face unnecessary funding shortfalls in some spending categories, and will be more likely to pay the costs of re-allocating the revenues.  The theory is tested empirically using the case of Oklahoma counties and their management of the county highway fund from 1973 to 2012. Results are in line with the theory, suggesting that a moderate amount of earmarked revenues stimulate specific expenditures, but the effect diminishes as earmarks become a larger portion of the government’s total revenues.Chapter 4. There is increasing recognition among scholars that the fiscal link between citizens and their governments is an important contributor to more efficient allocation of public resources and a more accountable government.  However, many local governments in developing countries receive the majority of their funding from intergovernmental transfers, which severs that fiscal bond.  There are some cases in which local governments, despite large intergovernmental transfers, have chosen to increase their own taxes. Understanding why local governments choose to adopt new own-source revenues is an important step in the search for policies that encourage more local fiscal effort.  This paper examines this question in the context of a local lighting tax in Brazilian municipalities.  Results indicate that Brazilian municipal governments are willing to engage in the politically difficult work of taxing their citizens in times of revenue shortfall and service need, but that political calculations and the influence of nearby municipalities play a bigger role in the decision to adopt a local tax."
etd_692,Essays on marketing information disclosure,Marketing,,"This dissertation consists of two chapters regarding marketing information disclosure. The first chapter empirically examines firms' voluntary disclosure of marketing information in their communications to the public, namely, in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A;) section of their 10-K filings. Although there are clear standards for what financial information public firms must disclose, marketing information disclosure is voluntary, in that each firm's management team decides not only whether to disclose marketing-related information but also how much and which particular information to disclose. However, little is known about the value of voluntary marketing information disclosure. Indeed, the incentive for firms to strategically disclose marketing information in an effort to attain a more positive assessment of their future prospects leads to a series of managerially relevant but unanswered questions. To address these questions, I assemble a custom data set containing structured (i.e., numerical) and unstructured (i.e., textual) data from different sources. The sample is sufficiently large and comprehensive in that it includes 26,572 MD&A; sections disclosed by 4,999 public firms between fiscal years 2004 and 2013. I find that marketing information disclosure is fairly prevalent across industries. More importantly, I find a highly significant and positive relationship between marketing information and firm value. In addition, I find that firm size moderates the impact of marketing information on firm value, with this impact increasing in accordance with firm size. Somewhat surprisingly, I find a large, positive effect from “hidden” marketing information, suggesting that the marketing information not explicitly revealed in the MD&A; section (e.g., proprietary information) can be even more important than what is revealed. Overall, this study provides important new insights for policy makers, firms, and individuals (e.g., analysts, investors).The second chapter explores the relationship between managers’ perceived competition and advertising investment. Using an innovative measure that is based on firms’ discussions of competition in their 10-K filings to proxy for managers’ perceived competition, I find a J-shaped relationship between managers’ perception of the intensity of market competition and the firms’ advertising investment in the next year. Further, I show that this curvilinear relationship is moderated by macroeconomic conditions. In particular, economic contractions reinforce the J-shaped relationship. Overall, this research contributes to the marketing-finance literature by identifying a new determinant of advertising investment (namely, managers’ perception of competition), providing a more nuanced perspective on the competition-investment relationship, and highlighting the moderating role played by business cycles. Moreover, my study illustrates that unstructured information disclosed by public firms can be translated into valuable insights."
etd_727,ESSAYS ON MISSPECIFICATION IN HIGH DIMENSIONAL ECONOMETRICS AND ASSET PRICING,Economics,"High dimensional factor model, Long-term risk, Misspecification, Number of factors, Recovery theorem","This dissertation examines misspecification issues in two contexts: (i) signal (or equivalently factor) detection in high-dimensional factor models and (ii) the identification of the physical probability distribution of stock returns in the asset pricing literature.The first essay revisits the panel information criteria (IC) proposed by Bai and Ng (2002), which is a popular estimator for the number of factors in high-dimensional factor models, and studies its over-detection risk in finite samples. First, we analyze the finite sample performance of IC by computing the over-detection probability bound. In particular, we specify the asymptotic over-detection condition of IC in terms of eigenvalues coming from pure noise and then derive the computable formula for a non-asymptotic upper bound on the overestimation probability by adopting random matrix theory. We show that unless the sample size is sufficiently large, the overestimation probability is not negligible even for the case in which factors have strong explanatory power. Second, we show that for small sample sizes the over-detection risk of IC is significantly reduced by the degrees of freedom adjustment in the penalty of the original criteria. Finally, we propose modified information criteria (MIC) as a practical guide to improving the finite sample performance of IC. Simulations show that our MIC outperforms IC for the case with weakly serially or cross-sectionally correlated errors as well as i.i.d. errors.The second essay examines the misdetection risk of the panel information criteria (IC) proposed by Bai and Ng (2002) for detecting the number of factors in high-dimensional factor models and examines the optimal penalty to minimize an upper bound on the misdetection probability of the IC estimator in finite samples. This study extends the first chapter, which analyzed the finite sample performance of the IC estimator regarding its over-detection risk, to the comprehensive misdetection risk considering under-detection risk as well. We derive the computable formula for a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misdetection probability by employing recent results from random matrix theory. Using the formula, we analyze the misdetection risk of the IC estimator and achieve the minimum upper bound of the misdetection probability by finding the optimal weight for the penalty function. Our numerical examples suggest that modified criteria with the optimized penalization improve the finite sample performance of the original IC estimator.In my third essay, we revisit the Recovery theorem on the identification of the physical probability distribution of stock returns, proposed by Ross (2015). First, its applicability in fixed-income markets is considered. We suggest a new procedure for applying the Recovery theorem to the Gaussian affine term structure. As a result, we can recover a particular probability distribution and decompose forward rates into the investors' short-rate expectations and term premia under this recovered probability measure. Next, the reliability of the Recovery theorem is examined. In particular, we study its misspecification issue in line with the claim of misspecified recovery by Borovi?ka, Hansen, and Scheinkman (2015). Our empirical result verifies that what Ross really recovers is not the physical probability but the long-term risk-neutral probability which absorbs compensation for exposure to permanent shocks. In consequence, we can decompose forward term premia into nearly constant short-term risk premia associated with transitory shocks and highly volatile long-term risk premia corresponding to permanent shocks. Finally, we find that a secular decline in forward rates is mostly attributed to investors' short-rate expectations under the long-term risk-neutral probability measure, and all important variations in term premia can be captured by long-term risk premia. Concisely, long-term risk matters for asset pricing."
busad_etd_94,Essays on New Venture Diversification,Business Administration,"Product-diversification, Entrepreneurship","Product-diversification research has proliferated for decades and has been conducted in a variety of organizational settings, industries, and countries. Nevertheless, this literature has remained firmly entrenched within the context of large and well-established ventures. As such, we know little about the ramifications of product-diversification for new ventures. This dissertation is aimed at filling this knowledge gap. The central research question of the dissertation is: ""what are the consequences of a firm being product-diversified at the time of founding?"" In pursuit of the answer to this question, three essays were produced. The first essay defines new venture diversification and draws upon multiple existing literatures to inform the concept as well as formulate propositions on relationships between new venture diversification and other salient constructs within the entrepreneurship literature. The second essay focuses the lens on a specific outcome by theoretically and empirically investigating the effect of new venture diversification on firm survival. In testing the effect on a world-wide sample of microfinance firms, the results suggest that new venture diversification is detrimental to survival rates and that this relationship is moderated by financial resource levels. The third essay investigates the relationship between new venture diversification and financial stability. Through an analysis of the same sample of microfinance firms, the results show that greater diversification produces increased financial stability for new ventures. The conclusions of the dissertation are as follows: 1) firms can and often do begin product-diversified, 2) new venture diversification has ramifications for important firm outcomes, 3) there are both positive and negative consequences of beginning diversified, and 4) current theorizing on diversification does not fully apply to new ventures."
busad_etd_92,Essays on Operational Flexibilities in Production Planning under Supply and Quality Uncertainty,Business Administration,"Advance Selling, Operations Management, Production Planning, Quality Uncertainty, Supply Uncertainty","This dissertation investigates the use of operational flexibilities in production planning in order to mitigate the negative effects of supply and quality uncertainty. Uncertainties in supply and quality are commonly experienced among agro-businesses, and in particular, in the wine industry. The goal of the dissertation is to provide prescriptive solutions in mitigating such risks from the lives of agricultural businesses.The first essay of the dissertation examines the impact of supply and quality uncertainty on the investment decisions made by winemakers who lease vineyard space to grow their own fruit. At the end of the growing season, the winemaker receives an uncertain amount of high- and low-quality grapes, due to varying growing conditions such as adverse weather conditions, diseases and natural disasters. High-quality grapes are used in the making of a high-end (reserve) wine, and low-quality grapes are used for the production of a low-end wine. In this study, we investigate the benefits of the downward substitution flexibility, where the winemaker uses its excess high-quality grapes for the production of its low-end wine. In addition, we examine the influence of, and the interrelationships between, three forms of operational flexibilities: downward substitution, price-setting, and fruit trading flexibilities.The second essay of the dissertation investigates the use of advance selling to mitigate quality risk in wine production. This essay examines the influence of quality uncertainty on winemakers' decisions regarding the allocation of its wine for retail operations. Specifically, we study what proportion of the wine should be sold through regular distribution channels versus what proportion should be sold as ""wine futures"" in advance of bottling. Due to the intricacies of the production method, the quality of wine may vary from the moment aging begins in the barrel to the time it is bottled and sold to the general public. This study examines the use of wine futures, whereby a winemaker sells its wine while it is still in the barrel in order to reduce the quality rating risk at the time of distribution. Overall, wine futures not only allow the winemaker to pass on the quality rating risk established through expert tastings to consumers but also let them bring in cash for immediate reinvestment into the next vintage."
busad_etd_91,Essays on Risk Mitigation Methods in Global Supply Chain Management,Business Administration,"Demand Uncertainty, Exchange Rate Uncertainty, Global Supply Chain Management, Humanitarian Supply Chain Management, Operations Management, Pricing","In this dissertation, we study risk mitigation methods in the area of global supply chain management. Recent economic uncertainties such as the U.S. credit and the Greek debt crises, and natural disasters such as the Japanese tsunami create a greater amount of uncertainty and risk for global supply chain operations. The goal of the dissertation is to develop new prescriptive policies for multinational corporations and global relief organizations in order to assist them in mitigating the risks present in their operating environment in an effective manner.The first essay of the dissertation investigates how a multinational corporation can effectively hedge against the exchange-rate risk by structuring and managing a supply chain in a global setting. Economic uncertainties such as the U.S. credit crises and the debt concerns in southern European countries (e.g., Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) call for new policies in order to operate under an increased level of uncertainty. For example, even though the Japanese Yen and the US Dollar are considered to be more stable currencies, they have exhibit significant fluctuations in recent times, putting the US Dollar at its record low against the Yen on October 24, 2011, since the Great Depression. Naturally, such exchange rate fluctuations increase the need to develop new risk mitigation policies that would assist global corporations in managing the fluctuations in their global revenues and profits. This essay provides multinational corporations with prescriptions for ways to cope with the increased amount of global economic uncertainty. It demonstrates that production hedging, defined as producing and supplying less than the firm's total global demand, can be an effective policy in minimizing the negative implications of the exchange-rate risk while maximizing global profits.The second essay of the dissertation examines how a global relief organization can effectively hedge against the risk of demand uncertainty in its distribution of essential products to the areas of urgent needs. It is commonly observed that deficiencies in information infrastructure or economic instability contribute to the adversity of forecasting the need for essential supplies. This study stems from recognizing the ineffectiveness in the distribution of humanitarian aid supply in countries of need. Such distribution inefficiencies can lead to harmful consequences for many people. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that in 2007 alone, 9.2 million children worldwide under the age of five died from largely preventable causes. It is important to recognize that many of the well-developed theories are hard to apply in these countries because of inferior infrastructure and the unstable nature of the economy and political environment. Thus, it is critical to develop new policies and insights for the managers of humanitarian organizations in order to increase the efficiency of distribution operations under uncertainty. Specifically, the second essay of this dissertation demonstrates that a relief organization can minimize the risk of shortages by strategically utilizing its limited budget on procurement and the transportation of essential supplies."
etd_458,Essays on structural changes in high dimensional econometric models,Economics,"high dimensionality, structural changes","This dissertation consists of three essays on estimating and testing structural changes in high dimensional econometrics models. These essays are based on three working papers joint with Prof. Badi Baltagi and Prof. Chihwa Kao. The first essay considers estimating the date of a single common change in the regression coefficients of a heterogeneous large N and large T panel data model with or without strong cross- sectional dependence. The second essay considers estimating a high dimensional factor model with an unknown number of latent factors and a single common change in the number of factors and/or factor loadings. The third essay considers estimating a high dimensional factor model with an unknown number of latent factors and multiple common changes in the number of factors and/or factor loadings, and also testing procedures to detect the presence and number of structural changes.The first essay studies the asymptotic properties of the least squares estimator of the common change point in large heterogeneous panel data models under various sets of conditions on the change magnitude and N-T ratio, allowing N and T to go to infinity jointly. Consistency and limiting distribution are established under general conditions. A general Hajek-Renyi inequality is introduced to calculate the order of the expectation of sup-type terms. Both weak and strong cross-sectional dependence are considered. In the former case the least squares estimator is consistent as the number of subjects tends to infinity while in the latter case a two step estimator is proposed and consistency can be recovered once estimated factors are used to control the cross-sectional dependence. The limiting distribution is derived allowing the error process to be serially dependent and heteroskedastic of unknown form, and inference can be made based on the simulated distribution.The second essay tackles the identification and estimation of a high dimensional factor model with unknown number of latent factors and a single common break in the number of factors and/or factor loadings. Since the factors are unobservable, the change point estimator is based on the second moments of the estimated pseudo factors. This essay shows that the estimation error of the proposed estimator is bounded in probability as N and T go to infinity jointly. This essay also shows that the proposed estimator has a high degree of robustness to misspecification of the number of pseudo factors. With the estimated change point plugged in, consistency of the estimated number of pre and post- break factors and convergence rate of the estimated pre and post-break factor space are then established under fairly general assumptions. Finite sample performance of the proposed estimators is investigated using Monte Carlo experiments.The third essay considers high dimensional factor models with multiple common structural changes. Based on the second moments of the estimated pseudo factors, both joint and sequential estimation of the change points are considered. The estimation error of both estimators is bounded in probability as the cross-sectional dimension N and the time dimension T go to infinity jointly. The measurement error contained in the estimated pseudo factors has no effect on the asymptotic properties of the estimated change points as N and T go to infinity jointly, and no N-T ratio condition is needed. The estimated change points are plugged in to estimate the number of factors and the factor space in each regime. Although the estimated change points are inconsistent, using them asymptotically has no effect on subsequent estimation. This essay also proposes (i) tests for the null of no change versus the alternative of l changes and (ii) tests for the null of l changes versus the alternative of l + 1 changes. These tests allow us to make inference on the presence and number of structural changes. Simulation results show good performance of the proposed estimation and testing procedures."
etd_656,Essays on supply chain analytics: Investment and capacity planning under uncertainty,Supply Chain Management,"Capacity planning, Disruptions, Investment planning, Weather uncertainty, Wine futures","In this dissertation, we study a firm’s investment and capacity planning strategies in the presence of different types of supply uncertainties and risks. Both essays in this dissertation benefit from empirical analysis as the analytical models build on the findings and observations from the corresponding empirical investigation. Each essay shows the benefits from utilizing flexible options that are deemed to be less preferable before conducting the analysis. Wine futures investment represents the flexible option (due to its liquidity) in the first essay, however, it exhibits greater uncertainty in price than the traditional bottled wine. We find in our empirical analysis that both weather and market fluctuations influence the evolution of the price in wine futures, and thus, despite being the flexible option, it also represents the riskier investment. On the other hand, capacity expansion at a geographically remote facility represents the flexible option (due to its greater backup capabilities) in the second essay, however, it is a more costly backup alternative than a nearby facility. As a result, both essays examine the trade-offs between these flexible, yet risker and/or costlier, alternatives, and shed light on the risk-reward structure of these various operational levers."
etd_429,Essays on the Economics of Rental Housing and Crime,Economics,"concentration, crime, Hurricane Katrina, rental housing, senior housing","Essays on the Economics of Rental Housing and CrimeMy dissertation consists of three chapters in the area of applied microeconomics. The first chapter exploits the mass evacuation of thousands of New Orleans residents to numerous counties throughout the South in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to identify the impact of migration on rents and estimate supply elasticities in local rental housing markets.  The second chapter follows with an investigation of the impact that the evacuations on crime in the destination counties.  The analyses in the first two chapters are conducted using data from American Community Survey and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting database.  The third chapter focuses on the relationship between ownership concentration and rental housing market outcomes.  This analysis employs panel data on individual senior housing properties from the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care to measure ownership concentration and to examine its impact on senior housing rents and occupancy measures.The Impact of Migration on Rents: Evidence from Hurricane KatrinaHurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coasts of Louisiana and Mississippi on August 29, 2005, leaving in its wake damage of catastrophic proportions.  The mass evacuations before and after the hurricane led to the long-term displacement of more than half of the New Orleans residents to counties throughout the United States, but predominately in the South.  This study uses a panel of Southern counties constructed from American Community Survey (ACS) data to estimate the impact of Katrina migration on local rents.   Relying on the exogenous nature of this forced migration, this analysis finds that population changes due to Hurricane Katrina evacuations expanded the market demand for rental housing and consequently increased rents.  Specifically, an increase in Katrina migration equal to 1 percent of the county population resulted in a 3 to 8 percent increase in the rents of natives. The study also suggests that the short-run rental housing supply is inelastic, with estimates ranging between 0 and 0.60.The Impact of Hurricane Katrina Migration on CrimeThe evacuations from Hurricane Katrina led to an influx of economically vulnerable people into numerous counties throughout the South This paper follows the empirical framework of the preceding chapter by exploiting the quasi-experimental nature of these evacuations to evaluate whether this mass migration had an impact on crime levels in the destination counties. The study uses a panel of Southern counties constructed of data extracted from American Community Survey (ACS) and the Federal Bureaus of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting database.   The analysis finds that population changes due to Hurricane Katrina did not have a statistically significant impact on the total level of violent crimes or property crimes.The Impact of Market Concentration in the Market for Senior Rental HousingThe senior housing rental market is one of the fastest growing housing segments, but relatively little is known about its market structure.  This paper uses panel data on individual senior housing properties from the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care (NIC) to examine the impact of ownership concentration in the market for senior rental housing.  Market concentration is greatest in the independent living and assisted living senior housing markets.  In the assisted living market, in particular, increased concentration results in higher average monthly rents and lower occupancy, as would be predicted by standard microeconomic theory. In the independent living market increased concentration results in increased rent growth and lower occupancy.  Nonprofit providers appear to attenuate the impact of market concentration, especially in the independent living market."
ecn_etd_96,Essays on the Impact of State Policies on Mortgage Finance,Economics,"Mortgage markets, Bankruptcy homestead exemption","This dissertation consists of two essays that look at the impact of state policies on mortgage markets. Both essays examine how and the degree to which states that provide more borrower-friendly provisions versus more lender-friendly provisions may exhibit different outcomes in the mortgage market. The first essay examines the impact of state bankruptcy homestead exemption and foreclosure laws on both mortgage demand and mortgage supply. The second essay analyzes how state bankruptcy homestead exemption and foreclosure laws affect different types of mortgages that are originated.The first essay examines the impact of state bankruptcy homestead exemption on size of the loan requested, size of the loan originated, and whether the loan application is accepted or rejected. The key source of variation used for identification is differences in the level of bankruptcy homestead exemption provision across state and over time. To estimate the effect of the provision, I compare mortgage activities in adjacent census tracts on opposite sides of state boundaries in the 55 urban areas that cross state borders. There are three key results. First, holding the loan-to-value ratio constant, a more generous homestead exemption encourages borrowers to buy more housing and take out larger mortgages. Second, holding house value constant, a more generous homestead exemption discourages mortgage borrowing and results in more home equity. Third, benefits of the homestead exemption outweigh the costs of it to mortgage lenders.The second essay analyzes the impact of state bankruptcy provisions and foreclosure laws on different types of mortgages that are available to prospective borrowers. The state legislations govern the rights of lenders and borrowers during legal proceedings and therefore impact on lenders' exposure to credit risks. The degree to which lenders would respond to those state legislations by adjusting underwriting standards may differ across mortgage products with different level of risks. Focusing on high-risk segment of the mortgage market, this paper looks for evidence that lenders tend to respond to higher-risk environment by modifying the types of loans that are originated. Three key findings are obtained using a similar border method as in the first essay. First, higher-risk loans are less likely to be originated in a state with judicial foreclosure requirement. Second, conventional prime loans are more likely to be originated in a state with larger homestead exemption. Third, FHA and subprime loans share a very similar clientele and are close substitutes especially for home purchase loans."

etd_228,"Estimation of Earthquake Input Energy, Hysteretic Energy and its Distribution in MDOF Structures",Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Ductiltiy, Hysteretic energy, Hysteretic model, Input Energy, Soil site class, Velocity index","Current seismic codes for building design often utilize a force or a displacement-based approach in their implementation. In a force-based approach, a structure is designed to ensure it possesses sufficient strength to resist the maximum forces imparted to it by an earthquake. In a displacement-based approach, a target displacement is calculated or identified and the structure is proportioned to achieve a specified performance level, defined by strain or drift limits, under a specified level of seismic intensity. A third approach, which has gained momentum in the earthquake engineering community, is the energy-based approach. In this approach, a design is considered satisfactory if the capacity of a structure to absorb or dissipate energy exceeds its energy demand from an earthquake. In the present research, a new energy-based approach is proposed in which velocity index (VI), obtained as the product of two ground motion indexes - peak ground velocity (PGV) and cumulative absolute velocity (CAV), is used to normalize input energy spectra. The use of VI as a normalization factor not only allows for the creation of dimensionless input energy spectra, but can result in smaller values of coefficients of variation when compared to other normalization factors currently being used.Earthquake input energy spectra for four site classes (Site Class B, C, D and E as per IBC 2012 soil classifications) and four hysteretic models (bilinear plastic, stiffness degradation, bilinear flag and bilinear slip) are developed for five ductility levels (=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) using ground motion ensembles of 38, 42, 38 and 26 recorded at site classes B, C, D and E, respectively. For purpose of design, the normalized input energy spectra are divided into three regions - short period, intermediate period and long period - that are consistent with the customary design response spectra contained in various seismic codes and standards. A close examination of these spectra has shown that regardless of the hysteretic models used, the normalized seismic input energy decreases as ductility increases, and increases as the soil gets softer. For each site class, empirical ductility dependent input energy expressions are developed, and hysteretic to input energy ratio relationships are formulated. The proposed design input energy spectra are validated using six major earthquakes and are found to reasonably match the spectra generated using time history analysis.Since the input energy spectra are developed for single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems, to facilitate the implementation of the proposed method in the design of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, simple expressions that relate earthquake input and hysteretic energies for MDOF system to its equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (ESDOF) systems are formulated. The energy relationships are verified using four (a three story, a five story, a seven story and a nine story) frames each subjected to six earthquakes wherein a very good estimate for the three- and five- story and a reasonably acceptable estimate for the seven-, and nine-story frames were obtained. A new method for distributing hysteretic energy over the height of moment resisting frames is also proposed. The new distribution scheme was used in determining the energy demand (hysteretic energy) component of an energy-based seismic design (EBSD). EBSD is a story-wise optimization design procedure developed using the relationship that exists between energy dissipating capacity and plastic analysis/design of structures. Finally, the entire process of determining the input energy for ESDOF systems to the distribution of hysteretic energy over the height of MDOF structures using the proposed EBSD design procedure is demonstrated using two design examples: a three-story one-bay frame and a five-story two-bay frame."
psy_etd_175,Evaluation of a Web-based Intervention for College Marijuana Use,Psychology,"cannabis, college, computer, intervention, marijuana, university","Young adults in college have high rates of marijuana use, abuse, and dependence. Web-based interventions have been growing in popularity, but their dissemination currently exceeds empirical support. One especially popular (but understudied) program is The Marijuana eCHECKUP TO GO (e-TOKE) for Universities & Colleges (San Diego State University Research Foundation, 2009). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether this program is effective in changing marijuana involvement and perceived norms in undergraduates. Participants were 317 undergraduates (52% female, 78% White) who reported marijuana use within the month preceding baseline. Conditions were the e-TOKE program or assessment only, crossed with brief vs. extensive baseline assessment (to assess assessment reactivity), producing four experimental conditions to which participants were randomly assigned. Thus, 161 (51%) received eTOKE (77 with extended baseline, 84 with brief baseline), and 156 (49%) received assessment-only control (85 with extended baseline, 71 with brief baseline). One month later, all participants reported on marijuana use, problems, abuse and dependence symptoms, and descriptive norms. Assessment reactivity analyses yielded no significant differences by assessment condition. Individuals completing the e-TOKE program reported less extreme descriptive norms (ps < 0.01) but no decrease in marijuana use frequency, problems, abuse, or dependence symptoms (ps > 0.10). Analyses controlling for baseline yielded similar results. The program thus seems effective for changing perceptions of others' use, but there is not yet evidence for its utility in changing personal use and problem indicators. More research with longer follow-ups is indicated, especially given the possibility that descriptive norms could play a mediating role in change."
etd_168,Evaluation of Non-Covalent Interaction Models in Molecular Crystals Using Terahertz Spectroscopy,Chemistry,,"Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate the low-frequency vibrational spectra of solid-state crystalline materials. Since THz spectroscopy is sensitive to both the intermolecular and intramolecular forces that govern the formation of crystalline materials, it is an ideal tool to investigate the accuracy of calculated DFT crystal structures and their vibrational spectra. When using solid-state DFT, non-covalent dispersion interactions are not fully treated in typical approaches. In order to account for these interactions, the addition of dispersion force correction terms are necessary. A number of methods exist to correct for this deficiency of DFT, and this work investigates the use of semi-empirical London dispersion force correction models. Through the investigation of several small organic molecules, amino acids and related compounds, the standard implementation (referred to as DFT-D) is examined, and the need to alter this standard approach has been identified. Modifications of the scaling factor and atomic parameters within this method have led to more accurate simulations, termed the DFT-DX model. In addition to this work on improving London dispersion force corrections, solid-state DFT calculations with these enhancements can be used to predict the crystal structures of previously unknown or difficult to synthesize materials, such as amino acid hydrates, and achieve detailed information about the internal and external forces in molecular crystals."
etd_674,"Evolution, epistasis, and the genotype-to-phenotype problem in Myxococcus xanthus.",Biology,,"The complex social behavior of M. xanthus makes it an excellent model system to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Under nutrient rich conditions, a swarm of M. xanthus cells coordinate their movement outward in search of prey. When starved, cells condense into multicellular structures called aggregates. Taken together, these two aspects of the M. xanthus life cycle display several sub-traits that are used to describe its phenotype. Furthermore, the genome of M. xanthus is large, encoding a predicted 7,314 genes, many of which have been linked to aspects of its multicellular phenotype.This work presented here addresses the genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) problem as it relates to the annotation of a biological process in a model system. The first project addresses G2P from a population genetics approach; we constructed a mutant strain library consisting of 180 single gene knockouts of the ABC transporter superfamily of genes to examine the distribution of mutant phenotypes among an entire group of genes. While the phenotype of only ~10% of mutants show extreme defects, more than three quarters of mutants are parsed into different categories of phenotypic deviation following our analyses. Our results demonstrate that strong mutant phenotypes are uncommon, but the majority of null mutants are phenotypically distinct from wild type in at least one trait. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the M. xanthus phenome will help elucidate the biological function of many uncharacterized genes.The second part of this dissertation examines the evolution of M. xanthus as it has been studied as a model organism in different laboratories. Disrupting a gene, or mutating a single nucleotide, may have no discernable impact on the organism's phenotype by itself, but may still substantially affect the phenotypes of additional mutation through epistasis. This is an ongoing phenomena in M. xanthus; whole genome resequencing of several inter-laboratory isolates of M. xanthus wild type DK1622 reveals genomic variation that has resulted in significant phenotypic variation. We demonstrate that the naturally occurring genetic variants among wild type isolates is sufficient to mask the effect of a targeted mutation in one isolate that is significant in another. These results are the first to indicate that isolates of wild type M. xanthus DK1622 have evolved to a functionally significant degree."
etd_746,Examining Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching: An Exploratory Study of Prospective Teachers’ Transition of Knowledge to Practice in Clinical Simulations,Teaching and Leadership,"Clinical Simulations, Instructional Practices, Mathematical Content Knowledge, Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching, Prospective teachers, Transition of knowledge to practice","In this study, I examine prospective teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) with a focus on their transition of knowledge to practice, within two clinical simulations (Algebraic Equations and Negative – Zero). The two clinical simulations presented problems of practice that challenged prospective teachers to enact their teacher knowledge to support students learning of mathematical concepts. The Algebraic Equations simulation focused on the translation of words in a sentence into algebraic equations. The Negative – Zero simulation focused on two mathematical axioms: (a) why a negative number times a negative number equals a positive number, and (b) why division by zero is undefined.Using an exploratory case-study design, I used secondary data in relation to the two clinical simulations to examine prospective teachers’ (PTs) mathematical content knowledge, instructional practices, and quality of explaining mathematical concepts contained within the two clinical simulations. PTs’ mathematical content knowledge was evidenced through the instructional moves that they enacted to guide standardized students toward understanding concepts, noticing (and addressing) mathematical errors made by standardized students and areas of possible misconceptions, and appropriate use of the mathematical register. Evidence of PTs’ instructional practices included the use of decompressing and bridging in the Algebraic Equations simulation, contextual examples in the Negative – Zero simulation, and asking questions and using representations across both clinical simulations. With regard to the quality of explaining mathematical concepts, PTs with a superior quality of explanation score demonstrated conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts by sharing multiple instructional moves and maintaining the responsibility of learning on standardized students through indirect instructions. PTs with a basic quality of explanation score demonstrated conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts, but used direct instructions. PTs with a low quality of explanation score demonstrated procedural understanding characterized by rote memorization of mathematical concepts.Findings in this study suggest that PTs with conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts are likely to have the knowledge they need to facilitate students’ learning of mathematical content, and that teaching experience explained variations in the quality of explanations scores. In addition to supporting the diffusion of clinical simulations in teacher preparation, this research suggests possibilities afforded in engaging clinical simulations as a platform for capturing teachers' thinking about mathematical concepts and instructional practices within an instructional context."
etd_669,Examining the Dispositions of Music Educators: A Perceptual Psychology Theory,Teaching and Leadership,"Dispositions, Music Educator Dispositions, Perceptual Psychology, Professional Identity","This study examines the disposition characteristics of twelve music educators with varying demographic and discipline backgrounds. The primary purpose of the study is to extract the dispositions of music educators and to make connections among dispositions, identity, and behaviors, all from the music educators’ perspectives.The theoretical framework of perceptual psychology (Combs and Snygg, 1959) informs the data collection and analysis portions of this study. Detailed interviews were conducted with the study’s twelve participants, using questions structured around four dimensions that previous perceptual psychology studies had found to be useful in distinguishing different educator dispositions (Perception of Self, Perception of Others, Perception of Purpose, and General Frame of Reference) as well as other open-ended questions designed to elicit other perspectives. I analyzed these interviews using both quantitative and qualitative approaches (Barrett and Stauffer, 2009; Clandinin, 2006; Clandinin and Connelly, 1995; Creswell and Clark, 2007; Creswell, Clark, and Gutmann, 2003; Tashakkori and Creswell, 2007), providing a resonant narrative foundation for music educator dispositions. Previous studies of dispositions using the perceptual psychology framework only distilled participant narratives into a numerical score, leaving readers with a limited understanding of the concepts being represented. This study uses a mixed method approach, consisting of the narrative scores generated by two trained raters as well as a narrative inquiry approach, to generate a rich understanding of the dispositions studied, from the perspective of and in the words of the music educators themselves. I conducted extended interviews with subjects about their experiences, and then had two independent ratersrate them on various perceptual psychology dimensions. I then further analyzed these interviews to identify stories or characterizations to illustrate these dimensions and to identify other themes.Using the quantitative method of inference ranking, I conclude that the twelve music educators fall into two distinct groups, distinguished by differences in each of the four original categories. Closer analysis of participant narratives provides support for the inference rankings, support for the four categories, and yields additional themes such as identity, behaviors, and various approaches to teaching. Music educators’ connections to their personal and professional identities fall within the Perceptions of Self dimension. While the study itself does not address the question of how particular teacher dispositions may affect students’ learning, its focus on the relationship between values, attitudes, and beliefs and teacher behaviors toward students lays the foundation for future studies to address that question.Keywords: dispositions, music educator dispositions, professional identity, perceptual psychology"
etd_276,Examining the Effectiveness of using CSR Communications in Apology Statements after Negative Publicity,Mass Communications,"apology, CSR, negative publicity","This study examined the effects of framing apology statements with CSR communications after a company has been hit by negative publicity. 316 individuals recruited via Qualtrics participated in an online experiment that tested respondents’ perceived CSR motivation, skepticism towards the apology statement, attitude towards the company, attitude towards the apology statement and purchase intention. A 2 (CSR fit: high or low) x 2 (CSR history: long or short) between-subject design was employed to examine the hypotheses. In addition, a control condition that presents a pure apology statement without any CSR-related remarks was included. The high-CSR fit condition had more positive results than the low CSR fit condition, as predicted based on the associative network theory, except for purchase intention. The long CSR history condition led to more positive results than the short CSR history condition, as predicted, except for attitude towards the company and purchase intention. In addition, the mediating role of consumers’ skepticism towards the apology statement and perceived CSR motivation were examined—a hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that the two variables mediate the relationship between CSR fit and CSR history on attitude towards the company, attitude towards the apology statement and purchase intention. This study also examined whether there exist any interaction effects between CSR fit and CSR history on the dependent variables. No significant interaction effects were found. Overall, these results indicate that public relations practitioners might consider employing CSR communications in an apology statement after a company has been hit by negative publicity when the company-cause fit is high and when the company has been involved in the CSR activities for a long period of time. Otherwise, mentioning the company’s CSR activities would have more negative results than a pure apology statement that does not include any comments related to the company’s CSR activities."

etd_57,Expanding the Usage of Renewable Energy Through Innovation and Technology Transfer,Public Administration,,"Moving green growth forward requires acknowledging the well-known carbon dilemma facing all nations: carbon-based economic development versus carbon emission reductions.  Switching conventional carbon energy to renewable energy offers a potential win-win solution to tackle this dilemma.  This dissertation empirically examines innovation and technology transfer of renewable energy technology at the international level with its three essays. The first essay explores how oil endowments of a country influence its innovation paths, specifically in the automobile sector.  I show that a country's oil endowment is a negative driver for alternative technologies, while a positive driver for oil extracting technologies. Depending on their levels of fossil fuel endowment, it appears that countries alter their domestic climate policy to either increase or decrease their dependence on fossil fuels. International climate policy could be designed to incentivize countries with increasing dependence on fossil fuels, and thus reach agreements for more rigorous action on climate change.However, in smaller developing economies with traditionally low capacity to innovate, technology diffusion is more important than technology innovation.  Technology diffusion from wealthier nation to the world's poorest is the fastest way to make the transition to renewable energy at the current state.  Hence, the second essay shifts the focus to technology diffusion, exploring how foreign aid helps developing countries increase their capacity to use renewable energy technologies.  I find that foreign aid on technical cooperation (transferring intangible knowledge) increases future renewable energy production more than foreign aid on non-technical cooperation.  This opens a new window for the on-going discussion of program and policy evaluation in the field of foreign aid, while also contributing to the fields of policy evaluation and climate change policy, especially for the diffusion of renewable energy technologies.Having shown the effectiveness of foreign aid in the energy sector, the third essay explores whether aid allocation by bilateral donors responds to the recipient needs in the renewable energy sector.  Bilateral donors have been known for allocating their financial assistance based on political interests among recipients such as former colonies and political allies.  The recent trends show that they allocate aid aligning more to their commercial interest. The findings support the recent trends of following the donors' commercial interest. Donors select recipients based on their economic interest especially through expanding their market having higher number of recipients. When allocating, physical proximity drives the amount allocated. This sheds some light on future research to explore the potential of multilateral agencies in allocating aid to meet the needs of the poor."

In an era of increasing globalization, this psychological dimension of citizenship requires further research and elaboration. This project seeks to determine if and how the academic and off-campus choices students make in college impact their worldview, their loyalties and sense of responsibility toward others. How far do students' allegiances extend and what experiences in college help to create these bonds and commitments? This study asks whether international experience via study abroad is a necessary ingredient for students to begin to re-imagine the boundaries of their social communities and their responsibilities as global citizens, or whether these processes can occur through more locally or nationally-oriented service learning, volunteer, or internship experiences.This project combines several strands of scholarship including cosmopolitanism (particularly its more contemporary, relational extrapolations and usefulness to understanding the underpinnings of citizen responsibility today) and political socialization (focusing on the expansion of one's in-group and the formation of multiple loyalties), viewed through the lens of the Millennial Generation. The study involves a detailed survey of undergraduate upperclassmen enrolled at Syracuse University's Maxwell School and provides a model for cosmopolitan learning."

The argument that pilgrimage plays a vital role in the Latter-day Saint (Mormon) tradition is undertaken in order to address larger questions of space, habitation, cultural negotiation, interpersonal interaction, and identity formation. By focusing on four elements of the pilgrimage experience - connection with ancestors, construction of sacred space, inclusion of play, and the practice of evangelization - the project considers how pilgrimage offers a tangible anchor for a globalizing religious community. Exploring Latter-day Saint pilgrimage in this way opens up new avenues for better understanding a rich religious tradition and a constellation of issues with wide scope and significance."

The key thermal characteristics of the various data center components were extracted from a set of experiments. This includes the development of practical experimental procedures for the thermal characterization of servers solely based on air temperature measurements and the transient response of the computer room air handlers. The knowledge of thermal characteristics paves the way for the physics-based lumped-capacitance models. A CFD-based transient simulation of the air temperature field, in which the transient thermal response of the servers was included via user-defined functions failed to predict the time-dependent server inlet temperature with acceptable accuracy and highlighted the need for including the thermal capacitance and heat transfer characteristics of the entire room, not just the servers. Hence, a practical faster-executing hybrid lumped capacitance-CFD/Experimental model was developed to investigate the thermal response of data centers under certain scenarios of cooling interruption, server shutdown and cooling air flow changes. Beyond the servers, the model takes into account the effect of the air volume, the building materials of the room and plenum and the CRAH units. The model is capable of predicting server inlet temperatures to within the experimental uncertainty (±1°C) with inputs that are relatively easy to obtain in a production data center."
etd_730,EXPERIMENTAL AND MODELING STUDY OF IGNITION-RESISTANT FUELS,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,,"This research investigates relative ignition behavior of some oxygenated fuels and theirblends with gasoline surrogates. It seeks to identify fuels with higher resistance to ignitionand validate tentative kinetic models intended to predict their combustion chemistry. Italso develops a method for simplified ignition delay time correlation that can allow for amore rapid estimation of the ignition behavior of a given fuel at known thermodynamicconditions.The work is motivated by the fact that in spark-ignition (SI) engines, increasing energyconversion efficiency through increasing the engine compression ratio is limited by thephenomenon of undesired autoignition known as engine knock. This is controlled by thechemical kinetics of the fuels which can be modified toward higher resistance using fuels ofhigher ignition resistance. In this study, the ignition behavior of the representative fuels isstudied using both shock tube experiments and simulations of the kinetics of homogeneouschemical reactors. Specifically, we study: 1) propanol isomers, which are alcohols withthree carbon atoms and promising alternative fuels for gasoline fuels; 2) MTBE and ETBE,which are effective ignition-resistant fuel components; 3) blends of a gasoline with ETBE oriso-propanol, to establish the kinetic interactions. The resulting experimental data are usedto validate current chemical kinetics models of the individual fuels. To further facilitate the use of fuel blends suggested by this study, combined chemical kinetic models are developed of iso-octane as a gasoline surrogate and each of ignition resistant fuels identified.In order to reduce the computational cost of using the validated detailed models of thefuels studied, reduced kinetic models are developed. These reduced versions are of twokinds. The first uses the model reduction method known as Alternate Species Elimination(ASE) to derive smaller versions of the detailed models. The second reduction approachfocuses on the prediction of the chemical time scale associated with ignition. Here ageneralized ignition format is developed and detailed model simulations are used to obtainthe constraining data. This makes it possible to predict ignition time scales based onknowledge of temperature, pressure, and composition of the combustible mixture.The work advances understanding of biofuels combustion by characterizing ignitionproperties of promising fuel additives and the effects of fuel blend on ignition. Theresulting experimental data sets are useful for validating existing and future kinetic models.The combined models will allow for better insight into the combustion chemistry ofignition-resistant fuels formed from blending iso-octane with iso-propanol or ETBE."
mae_etd_71,Experimental and Numerical Investigations of the Thermal Environment in Air-cooled Data Centers,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes, Temperature distribution","The goal of the present work is to evaluate Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD as a tool to accurately predict the temperature distribution in air-cooled data centers with the aid of high quality test data. A data center research laboratory (RL) was constructed and heavily instrumented to measure power, flow rates, velocities, turbulent intensity, and temperature distribution around three simulated computer racks in the controlled RL environment. CFD models were developed and the results were validated against the experimental data measured in the RL. All CFD simulations were performed using a commercial CFD software package (ANSYS FLUENT 13) for the flow solver, and the computational grids were generated using the commercial grid-generation software GAMBIT 2.4.6.Subsequently, a CFD parametric study was performed in order to illustrate the effect of various modeling factors on the accuracy of data center CFD simulations. The starting point of this parametric study was a comparison of the experimental data with the results of a baseline CFD case representing the current data center CFD simulation practice. Sequentially, several modeling factors were varied to study their effects on the CFD simulation results, e.g., turbulent boundary conditions, floor thermal boundary condition, grid resolution, geometry details, buoyancy, and tile flow model. The study showed that the strongest factors influencing and improving the CFD simulation results are the inclusion of correct tile flow model, buoyancy, and ""realistic"" turbulent boundary conditions. The remaining factors were found to be of secondary importance. A practical tile flow model ""momentum source model"" was developed to correct for the global values of both mass and momentum of the jets issuing from the perforated tiles and chassis exhaust doors. The inclusion of the momentum source compensates for the momentum lost when the flow from perforated openings is ""smeared"" over the entire opening to simplify the CFD representation. With the inclusion of momentum sources, buoyancy, and realistic turbulent boundary conditions, a reasonably accurate (~1.5 °C RMS error) temperature distribution can be obtained with grid size on the order of 4"" typically employed in practical data center CFD simulations."
mae_etd_67,Experimental Investigation of an Actively Controlled Three-Dimensional Turret Wake,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Active Flow Control, Bluff Body Wake, Experimental, Turbulence, Turret","Hemispherical turrets are bluff bodies commonly used to house optical systems on airborne platforms. These bluff bodies develop complex, three-dimensional flow fields that introduce high mean and fluctuating loads to the turret as well as the airframe support structure which reduce the performance of both the optical systems and the aircraft. An experimental investigation of the wake of a three-dimensional, non-conformal turret was performed in a low-speed wind tunnel at Syracuse University to develop a better understanding of the fundamental flow physics associated with the turret wake. The flow field was studied at a diameter based Reynolds number of 550,000 using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and dynamic pressure measurements both with and without active flow control. Pressure measurements were simultaneously sampled with the PIV measurements and taken on the surrounding boundary layer plate and at several locations on the turret geometry. Active flow control of the turret wake was performed around the leading edge of the turret aperture using dynamic suction in steady open-loop, unsteady open-loop, and simple closed-loop configurations. Analysis of the uncontrolled wake provided insight into the complex three-dimensional wake when evaluated spatially using PIV measurements and temporally using spectral analysis of the pressure measurements. Steady open-loop suction was found to significantly alter the spatial and temporal nature of the turret wake despite the control being applied locally to the aperture region of the turret. Unsteady open-loop and simple closed-loop control were found to provide similar levels of control to the steady open-loop forcing with a 45% reduction in the control input as calculated using the jet momentum coefficient. The data set collected provides unique information regarding the development of the baseline three-dimensional wake and the wake with three different active flow control configurations. These data can be used to help guide future studies, both experimental and computational, of similar geometries and to provide insight for developing active control systems for complex, three-dimensional flows."
etd_14,Experimental Investigation of the Active Flow Control on a Two-Dimensional Wind Turbine Airfoil,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Active Flow Control, BEM, POD, Unsteady Aerodynamic Loading, Wake Interaction, Wind Energy","Wind turbine blades experience unsteady aerodynamic loading under various off-design conditions. The fatigue loading reduces the operational time of the wind turbine hence leads to an increase in the Cost of Energy (CoE) of the wind power. In this study, active flow control with unsteady blowing actuators was applied to a two-dimensional wind turbine airfoil to alleviate the unsteady aerodynamic loading and improve the aerodynamic performance, particularly under large scale freestream disturbances. A low speed, open jet aeroacoustic wind tunnel was designed and constructed based on an existing anechoic chamber for this investigation. A theoretical analysis based on a Blade Element Momentum (BEM) algorithm was performed to evaluate the effect of flow control on the power output of the wind turbines. The result from the assessment indicates a 60% increase in operational range could be achieved with flow control. In addition, experimental investigations were carried out utilizing surface dynamic pressure sensors, a force balance and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) flow field measurement techniques. The results show that the fluctuating loading generated by an upstream cylinder wake was reduced by up to 12% using a proportional closed loop control algorithm at 27 degree angle of incidence. Under the same unsteady freestream conditions, the averaged lift coefficient at 19 degree angle of incidence was enhanced by up to 20% while the pressure drag coefficient was reduced by up to 10%."
etd_659,"Explaining Technological Change of Wind Power in China and the United States: Roles of Energy Policies, Technological Learning, and Collaboration",Public Administration,"Collaboration, Energy Policy, Network Governance, Technological Change, Technological Learning, Wind Power","The following dissertation explains how technological change of wind power, in terms of cost reduction and performance improvement, is achieved in China and the US through energy policies, technological learning, and collaboration. The objective of this dissertation is to understand how energy policies affect key actors in the power sector to promote renewable energy and achieve cost reductions for climate change mitigation in different institutional arrangements. The dissertation consists of three essays.The first essay examines the learning processes and technological change of wind power in China. I integrate collaboration and technological learning theories to model how wind technologies are acquired and diffused among various wind project participants in China through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)—an international carbon trade program, and empirically test whether different learning channels lead to cost reduction of wind power. Using pooled cross-sectional data of Chinese CDM wind projects and spatial econometric models, I find that a wind project developer’s previous experience (learning-by-doing) and industrywide wind project experience (spillover effect) significantly reduce the costs of wind power. The spillover effect provides justification for subsidizing users of wind technologies so as to offset wind farm investors’ incentive to free-ride on knowledge spillovers from other wind energy investors. The CDM has played such a role in China. Most importantly, this essay provides the first empirical evidence of “learning-by-interacting”: CDM also drives wind power cost reduction and performance improvement by facilitating technology transfer through collaboration between foreign turbine manufacturers and local wind farm developers.The second essay extends this learning framework to the US wind power sector, where I examine how state energy policies, restructuring of the electricity market, and learning among actors in wind industry lead to performance improvement of wind farms. Unlike China, the restructuring of the US electricity market created heterogeneity in transmission network governance across regions. Thus, I add transmission network governance to my learning framework to test the impacts of different transmission network governance models. Using panel data of existing utility-scale wind farms in US during 2001-2012 and spatial models, I find that the performance of a wind project is improved through more collaboration among project participants (learning-by-interacting), and this improvement is even greater if the wind project is interconnected to a regional transmission network coordinated by an independent system operator or a regional transmission organization (ISO/RTO).In the third essay, I further explore how different transmission network governance models affect wind power integration through a comparative case study. I compare two regional transmission networks, which represent two major transmission network governance models in the US: the ISO/RTO-governance model and the non-RTO model. Using archival data and interviews with key network participants, I find that a centralized transmission network coordinated through an ISO/RTO is more effective in integrating wind power because it allows resource pooling and optimal allocating of the resources by the central network administrative agency (NAO). The case study also suggests an alternative path to improved network effectiveness for a less cohesive network, which is through more frequent resource exchange among subgroups within a large network. On top of that, this essay contributes to the network governance literature by providing empirical evidence on the coexistence of hierarchy, market, and collaboration in complex service delivery networks. These coordinating mechanisms complement each other to provide system flexibility and stability, particularly when the network operates in a turbulent environment with changes and uncertainties."

The goal was to observe whether higher intakes of these vitamins were associated with higher bone mineral density as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and to potentially examine the impact of activity level on these relationships.Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to examine a subset of data from a larger on-going longitudinal study on bone growth and physical activity in young females. The original study was designed to compare activity, and bone density data between gymnast and non-gymnasts. The data used in this analysis were collected from January 2009 to September 2012 from 52 pre-menarcheal female gymnasts and non-gymnasts between the ages of 9-11. Participants were asked to complete Harvard’s Youth/Adolescent Questionnaire biannually to quantify nutrient intake. Annual bone density measurements were taken of the lumbar spine and total body using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Participants also were asked to self-report physical activity semi-annually during an interview session in which they described the type of activity and hours per week of participation. Tanner breast and pubic stages were self-assessed by subjects at each interview session. Standing height, sitting height, and weight measures were collected at the interview sessions as well.Participants: The participants were 52 pre-menarcheal female gymnasts and non-gymnasts between the ages of 9-11. The selection criteria for this analysis was limited to participants who self-reported as Tanner Stage I (Tanner breast I and Tanner pubic I) at the time of the annual DXA scan. This criterion minimizes the potentially confounding effects of estrogen on bone density and mineral concentration. Non-Caucasian subjects were not included in this analysis as the original cohort of subjects were predominantly Caucasian and the sample size for the current study was too small to account for racial variation. A factor analysis was performed to decrease the dimensionality of the full data set. A principle component analysis was used to observe groupings of dietary variables and to better understand over all dietary patterns. Pearson correlations, and simple linear regressions were used to identify associations between specific micronutrients and minerals and bone mineral density. Multiple regression analyses and ANOVA (general linear model, GLM) were used to further examine the relationships relationship between bone mineral density and the intake of vitamin A, vitamin D, biologically active vitamin K, and the ratio of vitamin A:D intake while adjusting for physical activity, weight, and age of participants. Statistical significance for all tests was set at the ?=0.05 level.Results: Inverse relationships were found between bone mineral density and dietary intake of vitamin A (p=0.018), beta-carotene (p=0.008), fiber (p=0.029), and carotene (p=0.007). Bone mineral density increased with a combination of increased vitamin K1 intake and increased body mass (p=0.0006) and vitamin A and increased body mass (p=0.0001). A complex relationship appears to exist between bone mineral density and the combination of vitamin A and vitamin D intakes. The lowest bone mineral densities were observed in the highest quartile of vitamin A intake; this quartile was well above the tolerable upper limit for the age range of the focal population age range. The lowest bone densities were also associated with the highest levels of vitamin D, which was an unexpected result. However, this quartile of vitamin D intake was also above daily recommend intake levels for the focal population. Although not statistically significant, bone mineral density was lowest when vitamin A was either very high (4th quartile of vitamin A intake, mean ± stdev = 17,317.34 ±4358.86 IU) or very low (1st quartile of vitamin A intake, mean ± stdev = 5243.01 ±1230.68 IU) with respect to vitamin D intake. Intermediate levels of the ratio of the vitamin A intake with reference to vitamin D intake produced the highest bone densities.Conclusions: Higher intakes of fiber, vitamin A, carotene, and beta-carotene appear to be associated with lower measures of bone mineral density in this study population. Increased difference in the intake of vitamin A with respect to vitamin D appears to be associated with lower measures of bone mineral density, even with intake levels of vitamin D above the EAR and RDA suggested for this age group. This relationship may result from excess preformed vitamin A ingestion leading to increased retinoic acid in the body. Excess retinoic acid has the potential to impair vitamin D’s ability to carry out its own genomic functions. These relationships warrant further exploration in order to improve the understanding of the genomic impact of vitamin A’s impact on bone metabolism in the preadolescent life stages, as well as to aid in the prevention of negative effects on bone mineral density during this time period."
psy_etd_172,Exploring Distinct Aspects of Shame and Guilt: Can Startle Reflex Modification Differentiate Shame from Guilt?,Psychology,"Guilt, Shame, Startle Reflex","Despite the similarities between shame and guilt, there is a growing body of evidence that shame and guilt are distinct emotional constructs. Guilt, despite its negative valence, is frequently associated with approach motivation, whereas shame is associated with withdrawal motivation. Research shows that engagement of the approach motivational system yields attenuation of the defensive startle reflex, but that activation of the withdrawal motivation system augments the startle reflex. Thus, approach-related guilt and withdrawal-related shame should attenuate and augment the startle magnitude, respectively. To test this prediction, 68 participants imagined scripts of four different affective conditions (i.e., shame, guilt, neutral, positive). Startle response, heart rate (HR) activity, skin conductance (SC), and self-report affective data were collected. Both shame and guilt scripts were rated as unpleasant and arousing but the shame script was rated as more unpleasant than the guilt script. Contrary to prediction, no significant difference in startle response magnitude between shame and guilt emerged. Startle response magnitude of shame and guilt was significantly larger than neutral and positive. These findings are discussed in the context of the startle response and the need for additional research that could more directly address the question of approach versus avoidance motivation."

To expand knowledge regarding how individuals implicitly define the term, an idiographic, experimental approach called policy-capturing was utilized to determine what factors college students take into consideration when making determinations about others' spirituality. Participants were exposed to a series of 50 profiles describing hypothetical people, each of which contained a unique combination of different levels of five factors believed to characterize spirituality by researchers. Participants rated each profile to indicate degree of perceived spirituality. Regression analyses were utilized to reveal if individuals used the factors in a consistent manner when rating the profiles, as well as the relative importance of each factor in their policies of spirituality. Results indicated that consistency of policies and the importance placed on individual factors varied widely. No differences were found between more religious and less religious college students with regard to ratings of spirituality assigned to the profiles, consistency of policies of spirituality, the relative importance of any of the five spirituality factors, or the number of factors that were important in the policies. Findings support the idiosyncratic nature of the meanings attributed to spirituality, but call into question whether college students are consistently using the same definitional models of the construct as used by researchers. The discussion highlights the conceptual challenges that researchers of spirituality face and encourages the use of varied methods for continued investigation in this area."
etd_494,"Exploring the Differences in Girls’ and Boys’ Learning from Their Teachers’ Perspectives in a Coed High School in Kingston, Jamaica",African American Studies,"boys, co-ed, girls, grade 10, Jamaican schools, learning","Girls’ and boys’ learning has been socially constructed through capitalism, which is replicated in patriarchy, and connoted with recognized physical learned behaviors that have been perpetuated in Jamaica’s culture throughout generations. Employing historical materialism and black feminist theories, this study assumes that the socio-economic and political structure of colonialism to present neocolonialism has been inherently biased towards men while negating women, and had instituted classifications that have characterized girls and boys as different. The perception that differences exist is described through an ethnographic micro case study analysis that examined grade 10 girls and boys at a specific coed high school in Kingston, Jamaica from May – August 2015. This served as a microcosm of Jamaica’s general society.Data were gathered using participant observation and semi-structured interviews with 22 teachers, 10 females, and 12 males in different subject disciplines and were analyzed through descriptive coding of major codes: expectation, interests and participation and sub-codes. The analysis explains that there are no differences in the ways that boys and girls learn. The notion that differences exist arose from the social structures embedded in the country’s history that have implicated the formal education system through set curricula in which teachers themselves were trained to accept and have internalized. The teachers’ accommodation and attitude toward the ways 10th-grade girls and boys learn result from how they were socialized. I adhere to the reality that girls experience difficulty in learning like boys, and with more struggles that often get dismissed and ignored."

It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation.This research adds to our knowledge firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Through the use of networks; institutional, stakeholder and governance theory and qualitative research methods, this research explores IUCN's procedures to prepare both international and national biodiversity conservation related programs with specific examination of four South Asian countries [India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh]. The research outlines how the conservation objectives have been created and enhanced through state-IO engagements. It examines national conservational actions and policies that have been co-constructed as well as the skills and approaches that have been used. This research also defines where in IUCN network conservation innovation comes from and how they produce and adapt that innovation to global and national situations. Finally, the research also shows the historical development of global institutions and IUCN's activities with member nations in helping to define or redefine the concept of global governance. This dissertation makes use of and hopefully adds to our understanding of organizations as well as organizational theory.Additionally, the dissertation also explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation.Additionally, the research results may be helpful in illuminating some of the advantages and drawbacks of international membership organizations themselves, which may be helpful in future organizational policy formation and implementation efforts. Findings from this research will be useful hopefully to IUCN itself. The outcomes of this research will also be beneficial for global collaboration, networking, and for the identification of common concerns among the many environmental and conservational organizations at the international and national levels. In this broader sense the research outcomes might be beneficial to constituencies of the global North as well as global South because of the nature and coverage of IUCN and its role in conservation policy formation. This effort may serve as a model for additional research on international organizations."

However, the potential benefits of (electronic mobile learning) e-mobile learning have not been well understood from the contexts of the under-served, disadvantaged, and marginalized groups in higher education of developing economies. The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory investigative context analysis of how current uses and impressions of electronic mobile technologies among distance learners in rural communities of Botswana can inform instructional design strategies for creating more powerful, safe and disruptive distance learning experiences in higher education. Case studies were conducted to investigate both the learners and their tutors from two school districts in two rural communities of Botswana as a developing economy. Previous studies indicated that these technologies may provide greater access to educational resources and opportunities for the disadvantaged, anytime anywhere. However, data were limited to primarily higher economic nations that provided broadband and wireless access for pilot studies.Data from 54 participants, teachers from rural elementary schools and tutors from colleges of education in cities, were collected using interview and survey questionnaire techniques. The findings suggest 100% penetration of electronic mobile technologies from the sample drawn, but usages in learning and impressions were not significant enough to consider e-mobile learning as an alternative strategy for the rural communities at this time. Many barriers (e.g., lack of wireless access and computer technology in rural regions, lack of skills, and course designs using traditional methods that marginalize participation of rural learners) existed. Thus, the study recommends developing partnerships with local wireless providers and elementary schools, constructing centers for learning support at a sample of rural elementary schools, and piloting e-mobile learning projects at these centers in and for these rural communities. Electronic mobile technologies may be an equaling agent in the future, however the first step is to equal the access and design instructional materials that benefit the flexible needs of a rural community."

Coman-Guedj-Zeriahi proved that  any plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on $X$ extends to a plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on $\mathbb C^n$ when the germs $(\overline X,a)$ in $\mathbb P^n$ are irreducible for all $a\in \overline X\setminus X.$ In this dissertation, we consider $X$  for which the germ $(\overline X,a)$  is reducible for some $a\in \overline X\setminus X$ and give a necessary and sufficient condition for $X$ so that any plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on $X$ extends to a plurisubharmonic function with logarithmic growth on $\mathbb C^n.$We also study a problem in complex dynamics. Quadratic automorphisms of $\mathbb C^3$ are classified up to affine conjugacy into seven classes by Forn\ae ss and Wu. Five of these classes contain maps with interesting dynamics.  For these maps, Coman and Forn\ae ss estimated the rates of escape of orbits to infinity and described the subsets of $\mathbb C^3$ where they occur. Using these estimates, they constructed invariant measures for the maps in three of these classes. By the work of Coman on the fourth class later, the dynamics of the maps from the first four classes is completely understood. This dissertation  focuses on the dynamics of maps from the fifth class: $$H(x,y,z)= (xy+az, x^2+by, x),\; a\neq0\neq b.$$We investigate the behaviors of $H$ at infinity  and construct a dynamically interesting closed positive current of bidimension $(1,1)$."

This function is called the pluricomplex Green function of ? with logarithmic pole at a and is denoted by g?(.,a). The aim of this thesis was to investigate the extension properties of g?(.,a).     Let ?0 be a bounded domain of Cn and E be a compact subset of ?0 such that ? : = ?0 E is connected. In general, g?(.,a) cannot be extended as a pluricomplex Green function to any subdomain of ?0 that is strictly larger that ?. In this thesis it was proved that if ?0 is a pseudoconvex, bounded complete Reinhardt domain in Cn and E is a strictly logarithmically convex, Reinhardt compact subset of ?0 that does not contain 0 and does not intersect the coordinate axes, there exists a subdomain &?tilde; of ?0 strictly larger that ? such that g? (z,0) = g&?tilde; (z,0) for any z in ?. It was also shown that in C2, one can omit the condition that E does not intersect the coordinate axes.     The methods required to prove the results heavily use the relation between the plurisubharmonicity of poyradial functions on Reinhardt domains and convexity of related functions. Special classes of convex functions were introduced and discussed for this purpose. These methods were also used to discuss the extension properties of the pluricomplex Green functions when ?0 is equal to unit the bidisk in C2 and in that case a complete solution of the problem was given"

As a remedy to the problem of obtaining Arrow-Debreu prices of state transitions, we propose Markov chain approximation to autoregressive processes. Our work suggests that affine setting offers rich structure that enables us to obtain necessary inputs in empirical applications. In the second part, we estimate a canonical discrete time Gaussian three factor term structure model with the U.S. Treasury bond yields. We decompose bond yields into expectation and risk components without specifying risk adjustment inside the model. The results indicate that expectations component can be used in predicting economic activity."

With the growing aviation industry, more communities are exposed to noise pollution from aircrafts; and better control strategies are needed to meet the more stringent noise regulations.This thesis analyzes two sets of high-speed jet flow data and aims at better understanding the flow dynamics and noise radiation mechanism. The first set of data consists of subsonic / transonic axisymmetric jets and the second dataset is of a more advanced configuration: a two-stream supersonic rectangular jet with a flat plate extending from the nozzle exit. For both flow configurations, the analysis consists of two parts. Firstly, the flow and acoustic features will be analyzed using statistical and continuous wavelet techniques. With the subsonic case, several diagnostic signals are constructed and the flow regions related to noise radiation are identified. With the supersonic case, the near-field flow structures are categorized and their frequency-specific propagation pathways and interaction patterns are depicted. The second part of the analysis involves devising algorithms to extract noise-related events, analyzing the event features and looking for event-related flow structures. The algorithms combine multi-correlations, continuous wavelet and pattern recognitions and are able to identify noise-related events with fewer than 10% false matches. The algorithms are tested rigorously using several approaches and the extracted events exhibit features consistent with existing theories on noise sources."

SPR finds many applications in sensing and detection such as labon-chip, color based biosensor, etc. Present SPR construction methods require large bulky equipment which is only suitable for lab applications. In this dissertation we show how SPRsensors can be constructed for commercial applications by using novel coated fiber optics. These fiber optic sensors are made using a thin metal fiber layer deposited in between the dielectric mediums of optical fiber, i.e. core and cladding. The transfer of energy from the cladding to the surface plasmons on the metal layer is maximized when the electric field polarization of the fiber layers are aligned perpendicular/radially to the metal coating surface. These SPR based sensors are sensitive to changes in the refractive index within the evanescent field region near a metal-dielectric interface which supports charge density oscillations due to the molecular interactions occurring (surface plasma oscillation along the metal dielectric interface) in this region. This dissertation also discusses the opticalfiber physics in combination with SPR that can be used for detection and sensing of various (bio)chemical materials like detecting the strain due to a change in the refractive index or sensing the presence of specific markers in biosamples etc.This dissertation provides a detailed analysis of (i) electromagnetic wave propagation in optical fiber and specialized fiber optics with guided modes; (ii) dispersion equation and calculation of their cutoff conditions; (iii) the SPR fabrication process; (iv) a comparative study of performance of the SPR sensors, considering metal film coatings with optical characteristic at 10-20 nm.

etd_346,Fabrication of Conductive Polyaniline-Hydrogel Composites for Tissue Engineering,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Conductive Polymer, Fabrication, Tissue Engineering","Electrically conductive hydrogels have recently generated much attention, as they have significant potential to serve as bioactive scaffolds with the ability to electrically stimulate cells and modulate their functions. These smart materials not only possess the unique properties of hydrogels such as tissue-like mechanical properties, high water content and good biocompatibility, but also possess the properties of electrically conductive materials. Currently, conductive hydrogels are synthesized by either embedding conductive particles to or polymerizing ""intrinsically conductive polymers"" within a hydrogel matrix. However, one challenge still faced by nearly all electrically conductive hydrogels is their low processability, which limit their applications in tissue engineering and other biomedical engineering fields. In this work, we used an interfacial in situ polymerization approach to successfully develop two kinds of electrically conductive hydrogel composites: poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate-polyaniline (PEGda-PANI) hydrogel and gelatin methacrylate-polyaniline (GelMA-PANI) hydrogel. We demonstrated that as compared to pure PEGda and GelMA hydrogels, PEGda-PANI and GelMA-PANI hydrogels had similar swelling properties and compressive moduli, comparable cell adhesion and spreading, and dramatically improved electrical properties. In addition, we found that this synthesis approach could be combined with digital projection stereolithography to fabricate user-defined microstructured geometries of these two conductive hydrogel composites. This provides a novel method to improve the processability of electrically hydrogel materials, which can be extended to a wide variety of fabrication techniques and hydrogel types in the hope of developing next-generation functional biomaterials with predicable properties."

In addition, the world of computing has recently been witnessing a growing shift towards massively parallel distributed systems due to the increasing importance of transforming data into knowledge in today’s data-driven world. At the core of data analysis for all sorts of applications lies pattern matching. Therefore, parallelizing pattern matching algorithms should be made efficient in order to cater to this ever-increasing abundance of data. We propose a method that automatically detects a user’s single threaded function call to search for a pattern using Java’s standard regular expression library, and replaces it with our own data parallel implementation using Java bytecode injection. Our approach facilitates parallel processing on different platforms consisting of shared memory systems (using multithreading and NVIDIA GPUs) and distributed systems (using MPI and Hadoop). The major contributions of our implementation consist of reducing the execution time while at the same time being transparent to the user. In addition to that, and in the same spirit of facilitating high performance code parallelization, we present a tool that automatically generates Spark Java code from minimal user-supplied inputs. Spark has emerged as the tool of choice for efficient big data analysis. However, users still have to learn the complicated Spark API in order to write even a simple application. Our tool is easy to use, interactive and offers Spark’s native Java API performance. To the best of our knowledge and until the time of this writing, such a tool has not been yet implemented."
idde_etd_61,Factors Affecting Knowledge Sharing in Virtual Learning Teams (VLTs) in Distance Education,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","computer-supported collaborative learning, distance education, knowledge sharing, virtual learning teams","This study asserts that knowledge sharing (a component of knowledge management) in distance education virtual learning teams (VLTs) is important for successful collaborative learning and that various factors characterizing person and environment can impact VLT members' knowledge sharing behavior. Factors under the category of person are VLT members' competencies for working on VLTs, and their learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation. Factors under VLT environment are social presence in the VLT, the VLT learning community, satisfaction with the VLT, task type, and instructor strategies. Knowledge sharing is defined as a behavior in which VLT members impart their expertise, insight, or understanding to other members in the VLT or to the entire team, intending for the recipients to have that knowledge in common with themselves, the sharers. The study used Bandura's (1986) model of triadic reciprocal causation as a theoretical framework. The model is suitable for this research because it considers relationships between person, environment, and behavior. First, the study identified variables that are directly related to knowledge sharing. Next, the study validated those constructs. After the constructs had been validated, they were entered into a knowledge sharing measurement model. The study empirically tested a measurement model with five latent variables, taking into account the measurement error. Next, the study cross-validated the model with multiple groups drawn from the same sample. The sample consisted of data from 1,374 participants matriculated in graduate and undergraduate programs at an online university. The data were analyzed using split sample methodology, multiple regression analysis, and structural equation modeling techniques (factor analysis and latent variable structural equation modeling- SEM). The study's findings suggest that there is a direct predictive relationship between knowledge sharing and competencies for working on VLTs, learning environment, social presence, task type, and mediating relationships for learning community, social presence, and task type in the knowledge sharing model. This study contributes to research, theory, and practice. It concludes by presenting a knowledge sharing model that can be reevaluated with distance education student populations at various kinds of distance education institutions."

I follow the methodology in Beatty et al. (2002) and find that banks reporting higher recurring basis fair values, especially level 2 fair values and banks reporting increased fair values are more likely to report small earnings increases both in the current year and one-year ahead after controlling for discretionary loan loss provisions, discretionary security gains and losses, and other bank-specific characteristics. By decomposing the fair values into different types, I find that the positive association between fair value measurements and earnings management is primarily driven by available-for-sale assets. This relation can be found in both public banks and private banks. I also distinguish upward earnings management from downward earnings management and find that level 2 fair values are positively associated with upward earnings management and with downward earnings management via discretionary security gains and losses. By examining the relation between earnings volatility and fair value measurements, I find that banks recognizing more level 2 fair value assets and liabilities report smoother earnings over the time"
etd_716,FAMILIES DESIGNED THROUGH ART: EXPLORING EMBODIED EXPERIENCE AND CONCEPTION DISCLOSURE BASED ON SEXUAL IDENTITY,Sociology,"Assisted conception, Assisted reproduction, Assisted Reproductive Technologies, Conception Disclosure, Fertility treatment, Sexuality","This dissertation uses data from an original online survey including a diverse sample of individuals across different sexual and gender identities, who have given birth to at least one child successfully conceived using ART (N=114). I use a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques to examine parents’ experience undergoing fertility treatment as well as conception disclosure. My research has two overall research objectives: first, to explore and analyze variations in the experience of fertility treatment process based on sexual identity; second, to examine differences in attitudes towards conception disclosure as well as disclosure importance and behaviors based on sexual identity. I engage mostly a conflict, feminist and medical consumerism frameworks to discuss individual experience and behavior within the medical encounter for fertility treatment. I also use symbolic interactionism and communication privacy management theory frameworks to gain insight on conception disclosure processes.My findings highlight that some individuals felt the process of ART was depersonalized, regimented, and homogenized, which left them feeling disempowered and disaffected. These participants responded in multiple ways by empowering themselves through research about different options, approaches, and techniques; they questioned physician expertise; demanded inclusion in determining treatment plans; and at times, decided to discontinue their service relationships. The discontinuation of service is an important form of resistance for fertility patients who felt marginalized during the process or minimized to their biological and reproductive capacity. In this way, my research shows that fertility treatment is not exempt from medical consumerist behaviors. Individuals are agentic medical consumers who act as medical associates during the process of fertility treatment. Participants’ retelling of their experiences provides counter narratives to the patient-as-passive-recipient model of healthcare and responds to some feminist concerns. The overall experience during the treatment process did not differ based on sexual identity, however sexual minority persons had some unique experiences stemming from heteronormative structures.My data also show that parents were more inclined to disclose to family, close friends and physicians but practiced more restraint when sharing with other persons. When it comes to conception disclosure to the child, among other reasons, parents felt it was important to demonstrate to the child they were wanted and to transfer aspects of the child medical history.  They also thought disclosure was necessary to fight shame. In this dissertation, I argue that individuals make decisions about conception disclosure in response to social norms. More specifically, I make the claim that parents are engaged in subversive disclosure to disrupt dominant opinions about assisted reproduction as unnatural and children conceived through ART as “synthetic” or different. Thus, my research recognizes that individuals are embedded in social systems that ultimately influence their decisions concerning disclosure.  I observed nuanced differences based on sexual identity; which lead me to argue that heterosexual identified persons were more likely to restrict conception disclosure in comparison to sexual minority persons.Based on conception disclosure timing strategies I categorize persons as intentional early initiators or opportunistic seguers. I also grouped participates into two categories based on their conversational approach to disclosure: those who are straight talkers and those engaged in creative dialogue. Still conception disclosure can be overwhelming, leading some parents to create their own patchwork, hybrid approach. Sexual minority parents’ disclosure practice differed from heterosexual identified persons in one key way; specifically, sexual minority persons constructed the content to emphasize different family structures and the way families are created."

Families who are overly connected or disconnected are regarded as dysfunctional. However, several studies on Asian and Asian American families have reported divergent findings on family cohesion in comparison to European Americans. Distinct aspects of Asian heritage culture, such as values embedded in close interpersonal relationships and devoted parent-child relationships, may account for the discrepancies.  Specifically, Jung culture, Confucian ideologies, and acculturation strategies may explain the distinctive patterns in family relationships and parent-child closeness in Korean heritage families. To better understand cultural variations in family dynamics and interpersonal functioning at the family level, the present study investigated family cohesion including balanced cohesion, enmeshment, and disengagement, indigenous notion of parent-child closeness, acculturation, and their associations with children's socioemotional and academic functioning among Korean immigrant families via moderated mediation models. The sample consisted of 101 South Korean immigrant families with children in 7 and 14 years of age residing in the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area. Utilizing Structural Equation Modeling, the mediating role of Korean parent-child closeness was tested through the bootstrapping method and the moderating role of acculturation was examined via multiple group analyses. Findings revealed 1) possible cultural variations in conceptions of family cohesion and parent-child closeness, 2) the beneficial roles of family enmeshment for children's socioemotional functioning, 3) dimension-specific functions of Korean father-child closeness on child academic functioning, 4) the complete mediating role of Korean mother-child closeness between balanced cohesion and child socioemotional difficulties, and 5) the moderating role of acculturation in the association between family enmeshment and child socioemotional functioning. The findings are discussed in terms of practical and future research implications and the importance of cultural contexts in understanding Korean immigrant families in the United States."

Continued research is needed to better understand those factors that support father involvement, which has been identified to be a key contributor to maternal and child wellbeing.  This dissertation examines the utility of using existing, large-scale maternal-child health datasets to generate insights into the processes that contribute to father involvement.  Two large scale maternal-child health data sets on low-income families were examined to improve our understanding of the nature of father involvement at birth and in infancy/early childhood.  Multinomial logistic and logistic regression models were developed to examine predictors of father involvement at the time of birth and at 36 months after birth.  Significant predictors of low levels of father involvement included: 1) a non-marital birth/unmarried parents, 2) mothers without a high school education, 3) teen pregnancy, 4) maternal poverty, 5) race (a proxy for other social risk factors) for both Black and White mothers, compared to Latino mothers, but with Black mothers having the greatest likelihood of low father involvement, 6) maternal risky lifestyle/health behaviors and maternal prenatal health risks, 7) maternal depression/antidepressant use, and 8) unintended pregnancy.  These findings expand the boundaries of both the child and family studies and maternal-child health/public health literature by validating theoretical frameworks that have been proposed for the study of father involvement and by identifying maternal characteristics and behaviors that increase the risk for low father involvement.  This study identifies opportunities for earlier intervention focused on risk reduction and identifies additional areas for future research.  The results of this study enhance the literature on low-income, minority fathers--an area that has been identified as neglected and in need of significant attention."

Using the survey data collected in this research, this study also finds support for the existence of a butching effect occurring within the digital walls of these sites. This butching effect suggests that the more a gay man engages with media that perpetuate these masculine ideologies, the more he internalizes those messages and believes that in order to be considered attractive by others in the gay community, he must conform to those masculine ideals. Thus, gay men who frequently engage with masculinity-perpetuating messages deliberately alter their online personas to reflect those masculine traits in order to be seen as more attractive by other gay hookup website users."
etd_4,Feeling in Character: Towards an Ethics of Emotion,Philosophy,"Action Theory, Emotion, Moral Psychology, Virtue Ethics","This dissertation contends that emotions are subject to ethical assessment, not simply as motives or overt expressions, but in their own right. Emotions, I argue, are subject to assessment because they are aspects of a person's character. Specifically, emotions involve voluntary acts of attention, which are due to habituation. These acts show character by manifesting certain stable, deeply-held desires called 'concerns.' This view, dubbed 'Attentional Voluntarism,' is opposed to the prevalent view, dubbed 'Rationalism,' that emotions are subject to assessment because of their propositional content. Rationalism is unable to account for certain kinds of irrational emotion, where one forms an unwarranted emotion to avoid anxiety and secure pleasure. It exaggerates how mature and adaptive these emotions are. Attentional Voluntarism, by contrast, accounts for the childish and even infantile character behind such emotions, because the relevant habits of attention may simply be the residue from previous developmental stages."

It is an ethnography that utilizes feminist theorizing to understand tensions between feminists of different generations or waves; the complexities of identities and institutions in which gender, sexuality, and race intersect (bell hooks and Kimberle Crenshaw); and the workings of dominant gender and sexual norms (Judith Butler). As the College prepared to `go coed,' the prospect of introducing male bodies into this environment generated rich discourses about sexual differences, and the operations of individual and institutional power.Data for this dissertation were gathered through individual interviews with five senior administrators and twenty-two students, a group interview with four students following one semester of coeducation, and participant observations over the course of four years. Historical and contemporary texts were analyzed for evidence of competing feminist discourses. Each chapter of this dissertation discusses my findings of feminist generational tensions between students and administrators; of Womyns College as both a nurturing place and a site for practicing resistance to gender, sexual, and racial norms; and of the difficulties of challenging societal and institutional impositions of femininity and heteronormativity.This work contributes to the fields of education and women's studies by providing a thick description of everyday life at a women's college, and of a significant institutional transition - from a women's to a coeducational college - in American higher education. It describes some young women's negotiations of the constraints of femininity and heterosexuality, and exposes how hegemonic notions about sex and gender work. It makes an argument for separatist spaces within historically masculinist and white institutions: intentionally created and institutionally sustained ""homeplaces"" (hooks) where radical subjectivities can be cultivated by members of non-dominant groups."
etd_3,Filter-based multiscale entropy analysis of complex physiological time series,Mathematics,"Entropy, Filter-based, Multiscale","The multiscale entropy (MSE) has been widely and successfully used in analyzing the complexity of physiologic time series. In this thesis, we re-interpret the averaging process in MSE as filtering a time series by a filter of a piecewise constant type. From this viewpoint, we introduce the {\it filter-based multiscale entropy} (FME) which filters a time series by filters to generate its multiple frequency components and then compute the {\it blockwise} entropy of the resulting components. By choosing filters adapted to the feature of a given time series, FME is able to better capture its multiscale information and to provide more flexibility for studying its complexity. Motivated by the heart rate turbulence theory which suggests that the human heartbeat interval time series (HHITS) can be described in piecewise linear patterns, we propose the piecewise linear filter multiscale entropy (PLFME) for the complexity analysis of the time series. Numerical results from PLFME are more robust to data of various lengths than those from MSE. We then propose wavelet packet transform entropy (WPTE) analysis. We apply WPTE analysis to HHITS using lower and higher piecewise linear filters. Numerical results show that WPTE using piecewise linear filters gives us the highest classification rates discriminating different cardiac systems among other multiscale entropy analysis. At the end, we discuss the application of FME on discrete time series. We introduce an `eliminating' algorithm to examine and compare the complexity of coding and noncoding DNA sequences."
etd_440,FINE-GRAINED EMOTION DETECTION IN MICROBLOG TEXT,School of Information Studies,"emotion categories, fine-grained emotion classification, machine learning, microblog text, sentiment analysis, Twitter","Automatic emotion detection in text is concerned with using natural language processing techniques to recognize emotions expressed in written discourse. Endowing computers with the ability to recognize emotions in a particular kind of text, microblogs, has important applications in sentiment analysis and affective computing. In order to build computational models that can recognize the emotions represented in tweets we need to identify a set of suitable emotion categories. Prior work has mainly focused on building computational models for only a small set of six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise). This thesis describes a taxonomy of 28 emotion categories, an expansion of these six basic emotions, developed inductively from data. This set of 28 emotion categories represents a set of fine-grained emotion categories that are representative of the range of emotions expressed in tweets, microblog posts on Twitter.The ability of humans to recognize these fine-grained emotion categories is characterized using inter-annotator reliability measures based on annotations provided by expert and novice annotators. A set of 15,553 human-annotated tweets form a gold standard corpus, EmoTweet-28. For each emotion category, we have extracted a set of linguistic cues (i.e., punctuation marks, emoticons, emojis, abbreviated forms, interjections, lemmas, hashtags and collocations) that can serve as salient indicators for that emotion category.We evaluated the performance of automatic classification techniques on the set of 28 emotion categories through a series of experiments using several classifier and feature combinations. Our results shows that it is feasible to extend machine learning classification to fine-grained emotion detection in tweets (i.e., as many as 28 emotion categories) with results that are comparable to state-of-the-art classifiers that detect six to eight basic emotions in text. Classifiers using features extracted from the linguistic cues associated with each category equal or better the performance of conventional corpus-based and lexicon-based features for fine-grained emotion classification.This thesis makes an important theoretical contribution in the development of a taxonomy of emotion in text. In addition, this research also makes several practical contributions, particularly in the creation of language resources (i.e., corpus and lexicon) and machine learning models for fine-grained emotion detection in text."
etd_639,Finite Generation of Ext-Algebras of Finite Dimensional Algebras and Associated Monomial Algebras,Mathematics,"Homological Algebra, Representation Theory","In this thesis, we investigate the Ext-algebra of a basic, finite dimensional $K$-algebra $A=K\mathcal{Q}/I$, where $K$ is an algebraically closed field and $\mathcal{Q}$ is a finite quiver. We denote the Ext-algebra of $A$ by $E(A)$. We denote $\bar{A}=A/A^+$ to be the direct sum of all simple modules over $A$.In the first part, we use the work of Green, Solberg, and Zacharia to construct a family of elements in $K\mathcal{Q}$, which we call $\{f_i^j\}$. These elements yield a minimal projective resolution of $\bar{A}$ over $A$. Consequently, $\{f_i^j\}$ form a dual basis of $E(A)$. In Chapter 2, we see that the subalgebra of $E(A)$ generated in degrees 0 and 1 is of the form $K\mathcal{Q}^*/I^!$ and prove the relations in $I^!$ can be directly computed using $\{f_i^j\}$. In the case $A$ is graded, we provide an alternate proof to the result of L{\""o}fwall and Priddy, namely that $A^!$ is quadratic. Then we proceed to compute the relations which generate $I^!$.  In the case $A$ is monomial, we prove that the family $\{f_i^m\}$ is exactly the set of $m$-chains used by Green and Zacharia.In the second part, we use a construction by Anick, Green, and Solberg to form a family $\{x_i^j\}$ which yields a projective resolution of $\bar{A}$, called the AGS resolution. If $A$ is a monomial algebra, we prove there are easily checked conditions for $E(A)$ to be generated in degrees 0,1, and 2. If $A$ is not necessarily monomial, we consider the case where the AGS resolution is minimal. In that situation, we look to the associated monomial algebra of $A$, found in \cite{G1} and \cite{G2}, which we denote $\Am$. We prove that if the AGS resolution is minimal and $E(\Am)$ is finitely generated, then $E(A)$ is finitely generated."

A number of K*+??K+ states are observed, including K*(1680), which is observed in this decay mode for the first time (8? significant). A number of J/?? mass structures are also observed which cannot be described with $K*+ contributions alone. A broad and significant (7.6?) enhancement just above the kinematic threshold is best described as a D+sD*-s cusp, but a resonant interpretation is also possible with the mass consistent with the X(4140) state, but with a much larger width than previously claimed. The JPC is determined to be 1++ at 5.7?. Previously inconclusive evidence for the second peak is confirmed with a mass consistent with the 0-+ D+sD*-s0 cusp, however, much better described in our model as a X(4274) 1++ resonance (6.0? significant). The high J/?? mass region shows evidence for more structures of high significance, possibly two 0++ resonances. More data and going beyond the Isobar model may be required to clarify the nature of all J/?? mass structures observed in this decay mode."
phy_etd_132,First Leptonic Probe of Neutron Radii in Lead at Low-Q2,Physics,"beam modulation system, dithering analysis methodology, elastic electron scattering, helicity-correlated beam asymmetry, neutron radii in heavy nuclei, parity-violating asymmetry","Over the past decade, in Hall-A of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), both the HAPPEX and PREx collaborations have carried out various high-precision polarized elastic electron scattering experiments to explore the nuclear structure, the nucleon form factor and the weak charge of proton and electron. They have done so through the technique of the parity-violating asymmetry measurement with limited theoretical uncertainties. My dissertation focuses on the study of nuclear structure, namely the thickness of the neutron skin, using elastic electron scattering experiments.The direct measurement of the thickness of the neutron skin in heavy nuclei, where neutron are two-fold more than protons, constrains the slope of changes in binding energies of every single heavy nucleus with respect to the full nucleus density, including proton and neutron densities. In addition, a more precise description of the neutron density profile for each heavy nucleus can help us gain better understanding of nuclear binding energies and has astrophysical implications for neutron stars. As far as we know, the proton and charge RMS (root-mean-square) radii in heavy nuclei such as Lead (208/82 Pb) have been measured with an accuracy of 0.02 fm and 0.002 fm, respectively. However, there is no clear picture of the neutron density profile through a high precision neutron RMS radii measurement free from the strong interaction until now.Through a series simulations, both theorists and experimentalists have studied the sensitivity of the parity-violating asymmetry to the extraction of the neutron radii in heavy nuclei. Under some specific conditions, for instance, a fixed scattering angle of 5 degrees and a fixed Q2 of 0.0088 GeV2, a 3% statistic uncertainty of parity-violating asymmetries corresponds to a merely 1% error of the neutron radii in Lead (208/82 Pb). That is, the uncertainties of neutron radii in Lead (208/82 Pb) is three-fold smaller than the error of the parity-violating asymmetry. Since Mar. 2010, we performed the first electroweak experiment to probe the neutron radii in Lead (208/82 Pb). The normalized parity-violating asymmetries, after addressing false asymmetries, background asymmetries, to the 90% partially polarized electron beam and the momentum-transfer (Q2) is 0.656 ± 0.06(stat) ± 0.014(sys) ppm (part-per-million), which corresponds to the thickness of the neutron skin of 0.33+0.16/-0.18 fm. One of the most significant systematic uncertainties results from the discrepancies in beam parameters such as position, angle and energy on the target, leading to the difference in the differential cross-section between two helicity states. The helicity-correlated (window-to-window or pulse-to-pulse) beam asymmetries thus arise. My primary contribution to this experiment is to establish an analysis strategy used to control the size of the helicity-correlated beam asymmetries during the data-taking period. This analysis is especially addressed in Chapter 6.In sum, the neutron radii of 0.33+0.16/-0.18 fm in Lead (208/82 Pb) supports the existence of the neutron skin in the neutron-rich matter. A second future run will yield a much higher precision neutron radii measurement. Moreover, the strong correlation between the neutron skin in Lead (208/82 Pb) and the neutron start radius indicates an approach from nuclear physics to understand the astrophysical equation of state (EOS) for a neutron star."
etd_673,FITTING A PARAMETRIC MODEL TO A CLOUD OF POINTS VIA OPTIMIZATION METHODS,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,,"Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a powerful tool for designingparametric geometry. However, many CAD models of currentconfigurations are constructed in previous generations of CADsystems, which represent the configuration simply as a collection ofsurfaces instead of as a parametrized solid model. But since manymodern analysis techniques take advantage of a parametrization, oneoften has to re-engineer the configuration into a parametricmodel. The objective here is to generate an efficient, robust, andaccurate method for fitting parametric models to a cloud ofpoints. The process uses a gradient-based optimization technique,which is applied to the whole cloud, without the need to segment orclassify the points in the cloud a priori.First, for the points associated with any component, a variant ofthe Levenberg-Marquardt gradient-based optimization method (ILM) isused to find the set of model parameters that minimizes theleast-square errors between the model and the points.  Theefficiency of the ILM algorithm is greatly improved through the useof analytic geometric sensitivities and sparse matrix techniques.Second, for cases in which one does not know a priori thecorrespondences between points in the cloud and the geometry model'scomponents, an efficient initialization and classification algorithmis introduced. While this technique works well once theconfiguration is close enough, it occasionally fails when theinitial parametrized configuration is too far from the cloud ofpoints. To circumvent this problem, the objective function ismodified, which has yielded good results for all cases tested.This technique is applied to a series of increasingly complexconfigurations. The final configuration represents a full transportaircraft configuration, with a wing, fuselage, empennage, andengines. Although only applied to aerospace applications, thetechnique is general enough to be applicable in any domain for whichbasic parametrized models are available."
etd_268,"Flexible Labor in a Spiritual Economy: Peace, Work, and Inequality in Globalized Yoga",Anthropology,"Gender, Globalization, Inequality, Modern Yoga, Peace, Vishnudevananda","This dissertation is based on ethnographic research in the South Indian branches of the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres (SYVC), an international non-profit institution with a mission “to spread peace, health and joy through yoga.” The project describes the lived dimensions of relations across difference in the SYVC, offering an intimate perspective on the inter-cultural relations of globalization. I argue that imaginations of spiritual India at work in the production of transnational yoga eclipse power relations that frame and support the situation of middle class Westerners' escape to a spiritual place while others labor to make this escape comfortable. As a transnational organization, the SYVC also participates in a wider global complex of relations between wealthy and poor nations, catering to students and guests from both India and abroad, as well as managing both voluntary staff and paid workers from widely varying backgrounds. This makes the SYVC an important case for a study of the intercultural relations of globalization, even as organization founder Swami Vishnudevananda’s own mission for the organization was to overcome the divisions of nation, culture, and history. Yet, unlike the Free Trade Zones of neoliberal policies where cheap production is enabled by global political economic forces, the SYVC structure is situated in a spiritual economy of karma yoga, or selfless service, and peace is the stated goal. Here, low wage “flexible labor” contrasts with the work of volunteer staff with a spiritualized mission, whose cultural capital and/or greater economic flexibility allow them to give their time and labor for free. This transformed economy with a focus on the “spiritual” makes the SYVC fertile ground for consideration of ethical issues in our global political economy and an examination of the limits of cosmopolitan ideals."

These qubits are designed with different levels of Josephson junction asymmetry. The first two chapters of this thesis will introduce the reader to superconducting qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics. I will present experiments using the cQED architecture to implement fast photon swapping between an asymmetric qubit and a superconducting resonator using flux-driven sidebands. This is the first experimental observation of flux-driven sidebands in a superconducting system. This process also allows photon swaps between qubit and resonator to first order in the qubit-resonator coupling strength. I will detail an experiment to study and optimize an all-microwave two-qubit gate using the cross-resonance effect. This work constitutes the first experimental study of the cross-resonance effect vs. frequency and confirms effects from the higher energy levels of the transmon in the effective coupling during a cross-resonant drive. Lastly, I will outline a theoretical analysis and initial experiments to study the coherence properties of asymmetric transmons."

As tropical forests continue to decline the most significant response has been to understand the implications for the carbon cycle, with the impacts on forest dwelling peoples and wildlife, inadequately addressed. Multiple-use plants, individual species which at their most critical level provide food for wildlife, non-timber forest products and are commercially logged, provide a suitable lens for appreciating additional ecosystem services that may be compromised as tropical forests decline. I completed a plant inventory in the Rupununi and drew on the traditional knowledge of Amerindians to define multiple-use plants, describe their multiplicity of uses, describe vegetation types and assess multiple-use species distribution relative to land tenure classes and herbivores. I found four classes of multiple-use plants: wildlife food and commercial timber; commercial timber and traditional uses; wildlife food and traditional uses; and, wildlife food, commercial timber and traditional uses, each representing a unique dimension of ecosystem services such plants provide. A map created with descriptions of vegetation from Amerindian hunters showed that multiple-use plants are distributed in forest types that are critical for Amerindian livelihood activities. Further, as policies towards the extraction or protection of plant species are dictated by land tenure holdings, my assessments showed that strategies aimed at sustaining ecosystem services provided by multiple-use plants must consider the ideals for resource management within tenure classes. As expected, the distribution of a key disperser of multiple-use plants fruits and seeds - spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus), was closely related to the distribution of their food sources. My results show that land-use change impacting multiple-use plants will have implications for wildlife, and as a consequence traditional activities of forest dwelling peoples."

It explores how gender and sexuality appear within educational spaces and how providing students an anti-heteronormative inclusive education impacts a student’s sense of self. I show how critical pedagogy is deployed as an anti-heteronormative approach to supporting all students. The term anti-heteronormative is used to express an explicit rejection of heterosexism and genderism, acknowledging the complex oppressive factors that develop given the normative expectations of gender and sexuality and the impact such expectations have on all bodies and all students. Findings reveal how the juxtaposition of the inclusive space provided by the school and the heteronormative expectations of the outside world collide in complex ways for students. Bullying and challenges to inclusion persist. Critical pedagogy serves to help students assess the meaning bullying has for themselves and others. Likewise the critical pedagogy of the school supports a flexible curriculum and informal spaces that provide students opportunities to explore how they want heteronormativity to impact their lives. The anti-heteronormative approach of the school leads some students to find new ways of being – literally, new ways to exist – in the world."

Though extensive research has already been undertaken, the basic concepts of fretting corrosion including prediction of the instantaneous current response during fretting corrosion, still needs to be understood in a systematic form. The aim of this study is to present the mechanical and electrochemical elements of a model pertaining to the process of fretting crevice corrosion and the prediction of fretting corrosion current transients. The influence of sliding speed on fretting corrosion severity of CoCrMo alloys will also be measured. To be complete, a new fretting corrosion model that predicts instantaneous current versus time during fretting was developed to better explore the effect of instantaneous mechanical and electrochemical factors on fretting corrosion current. Based on the principle that there is a direct correlation between the oxide repassivation volume and the current, the method of the Duhamel Integral (Boltzman superposition) was used to link abrasion and repassivation of oxide film and the resultant current waveform.In addition, a new testing device was designed and built to observe fretting corrosion phenomena under microscopic conditions. The data collection and control systems that include displacement sensors and NI-DAQ board, as well as LabVIEW program, was also developed and is described.The effect of frequency/sliding speed on fretting corrosion current was explored in this thesis. All tests were performed by varying sliding frequency in PBS solution under fixed potential, load, displacement and surface roughness.The results demonstrated a strong correlation between model prediction and experimental data. This model gave a clear basis between fretting elements (abrasion per time) and current transients.For frequency tests, increased sliding speed resulted in proportional increases in fretting corrosion currents over the specific range from 0 to 400 ?m/sec. The current stopped linearly increasing above 400 ?m/sec, which is considered the maximum CoCrMo reformation rate under the conditions of this experiment. There were more sliding and sticking events, as well as fretting currents, in a unit time with increasing frequency. The rms fretting current was narrowed at higher fretting speed. Frequency does not have a significant effect on COF, frictional force or dissipated energy per cycle."

Through rhetorical analysis and a qualitative study, this dissertation explores how rhetorics of overcoming--the idea that disabled students must overcome their disabilities in order to be successful--manifest in writing pedagogies. Rhetorics of overcoming are rooted in medical model desires to diagnose students or have students self-disclose disabilities and then default to accommodating or remediating practices, which situates deficit within students rather than within inaccessible practices. To contextualize the pervasiveness of overcoming, I begin by highlighting how it manifests culturally in the media we consume and institutionally within higher education. Next, I trace the recent emergence of disability studies in writing studies and writing center scholarship to illustrate how dominant disability discourses have impacted our understandings of and interactions with disabled student writers. In response to a diagnose-and accommodate tendency and a lack of qualitative research about accessibility, I synthesize the results of a qualitative study with undergraduate students, writing instructors, and writing center consultants in order to more fully understand how students identify their needs and how different writing pedagogies address or ignore those needs. I then develop a framework that foregrounds accessibility as an integral part of literate practice, highlighting theoretically grounded assignments and activities that instructors can incorporate into their everyday practices. Ultimately, this dissertation argues that we must address rhetorics of overcoming in order to craft embodied, multimodal pedagogies that are critical and recursive--that are crafted not just for students but with students to better meet diverse and dynamic needs."

Much research has been conducted in this area; however, existing models do not relate function, behavior and structure in a comprehensive and consistent way. In this work, NIST's Core Product Model (CPM) and the Open Assembly Model (OAM) are extended to integrate product information including function and behavior, with an emphasis on assembly, throughout all phases of product development. For function and flow classification, the NIST functional taxonomy is used to maintain consistency with the literature.The consistency validation of product information, and the verification of modified product information are discussed; these processes ensure that the product information has no contradictions and allows tracing through associations without any deficiency or disconnection. In other words, the information model has to be complete in terms of traceability of function, behavior, spatial relationships, etc., in order to support all information exchange activities. The product information representation provides a mechanism for capturing product information and storing it in a database. This representation schema also provides necessary information for any future decision making activities in the End of Life (EOL) environment, such as the replacement or reuse of any part or subassembly. When there is a need to replace one artifact with another, one must consider all of the associations of the existing artifact with other artifacts and the environment, not just functional and space requirements, and the relevant modification(s) of the associated objects has to verified. So one can manage product lifecycle activities in different perspectives by knowing how the product information is interconnected in various domains and how its characteristics affect each other."

Intuitively, it appears paradoxical that non-native species, with no opportunity for local adaptation, can exhibit greater fitness than native plants with this advantage. Here, I compared traits of native and invasive shrub and liana species in Eastern North American (ENA) forests to test the overarching hypothesis that non-native understory species invasive to this region have superior resource-use strategies, or alternatively, they share the same metabolic tradeoffs as the native flora. First, at a global scale, I addressed the largely untested hypothesis that biogeography places significant constraints on trait evolution. Reanalyzing a large functional trait database, along with species' native distribution data, I found that regional floras with different evolutionary histories exhibit different tradeoffs in resource capture strategies. Second, using a common garden to control for environment, I measured leaf physiological traits relating to resource investments, carbon returns, and resource-use efficiencies in 14 native and 18 non-native invasive species of common genera found in ENA understories, where growth is presumably constrained by light and nutrient limitation. I tested whether native and invasive plants have similar metabolic constraints or if these invasive species (predominantly from East Asia) are more productive per unit resource cost. Despite greater resource costs (leaf construction, leaf N), invaders exhibited greater energy- and nitrogen-use efficiencies, particularly when integrated over leaf lifespan. Efficiency differences were primarily driven by greater mean photosynthetic abilities (20% higher daily C gain) and leaf lifespans (24 days longer) in invasive species. Third, motivated by common garden results, I conducted a resource addition experiment in a central NY deciduous forest to investigate the role of resource limitation on invasion success in the field. I manipulated understory light environments (overstory tree removal) and N availabilities (ammonium-nitrate fertilization) to create a resource gradient across plots each containing 3 invasive and 6 native woody species. Invasive species generally exhibited greater aboveground productivity and photosynthetic gains. After two treatment years, invasive species displayed more pronounced trait responses to the resource gradients, primarily light, relative to the weaker responses of native species. Lastly, I asked whether species exhibit similar resource-use strategies in their native and invasive ranges. I measured leaf functional traits of Rhamnus cathartica (native to Europe, invasive in ENA) and Prunus serotina (native to ENA, invasive in Europe) in populations across central NY and northern France. Notably, I found invasive US populations of R. cathartica had markedly greater photosynthetic rates (50% higher) and reduced leaf N resorption rates in autumn (30% lower) than native French populations. Contrastingly, I found minimal leaf trait differences in P. serotina between native (US) and invasive (French) populations. Collectively, my results highlight the utility of functional trait perspectives and support a mechanistic explanation for invasion success based on differential abilities of species to convert limiting resources to biomass."
etd_417,Fundamentals of microlayer evaporation and its role on boiling heat transfer enhancement,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Boiling Heat Transfer, Critical Heat Flux, Microlayer Evaporation, Three-Phase Contact Line","Boiling, a dynamic and multiscale process, is widely used in industrial applications as it can transfer a large amount of heat over a small surface area. It has been studied for over five decades; however, a comprehensive understanding of the process is still lacking. The bubble ebullition cycle (nucleation, growth and departure) happens over a very short time-span (milliseconds) making it challenging to study the near-surface interfacial characteristics of a single bubble, which involves a microlayer. The microlayer is a thin film present at the bubble base and varies from nano-scale to micro-scale in thickness. The dynamics of the microlayer dictates bubble growth and departure, making it of significant importance in understanding the fundamental behavior of the boiling phenomenon, and is the focus of this work.Firstly, a new mechanism of boiling enhancement based on the additional evaporation of the thin film is proposed and validated by fabricating micro-ridges on a surface and testing its boiling performance. A critical height of the ridges is found to exist, determined by the film thickness, below which no enhancement is observed while above which similar enhancements are achieved regardless of the ridge height. An analytical model is developed to determine the critical height from the experimental results.Secondly, the effect of ridge spacing on boiling enhancement is investigated. A ~120% enhancement in the critical heat flux is attained with only 18% increase in surface area due to the presence of ridges. The new enhancement mechanism is determined to be the early evaporation of microlayer, which leads to an increase in the bubble growth rate and departure frequency. Three enhancement regions are mapped based on ridge spacing and height: full enhancement region, partial enhancement region, and no enhancement region. The mechanism of early evaporation of microlayer is further verified by comparison of the bubble growth rate of a laser-created vapor bubble on a ridge-structured surface and on a plain surface.Next, in-situ imaging of microlayer and contact line region is performed in a steady-state vapor bubble created by laser heating. The in-situ measurement of contact angle of vapor bubbles is conducted. For the laser power studied, the contact line readily forms in regular DI water which contains dissolved air, while in degassed water, the microlayer covers the entire bubble base.  The vapor bubble contact angle is found to resemble a drop contact angle on the same surface if the three-phase contact line forms; otherwise it is dependent on the curvature of the microlayer and the bubble, and decreases with increasing heating power. The overall heat transfer coefficient and width of the evaporating region in the microlayer are estimated using experimental data and finite-element-method based numerical simulations, thus defining an upper limit to the heat transfer coefficient possible in nucleate boiling and thin-film evaporation.Finally, the contact line and microlayer behavior during bubble formation, growth, and movement is investigated. During bubble formation, the microlayer initially covers the entire bubble base, decreases in thickness as the bubble grows, and eventually forms the three-phase contact line. The surface wettability strongly affects contact line motion. On hydrophobic Trichlorosilane (FOTS) surface, the bubble remains adhered to the surface and does not follow the laser movement; while on hydrophilic SiO2 surface, the bubble moves smoothly following the laser. This difference in behavior is determined to originate from the change in direction of the liquid-vapor surface tension force, which results in a negative net force on FOTS surface inhibiting the bubble from following the laser, while it results in a positive net force on SiO2 surface causing the bubble to move on the surface."
etd_220,Gate-level timing analysis and waveform evaluation,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"interconnection, static timing analysis, table lookup, waveform","Static timing analysis (STA) is an integral part of modern VLSI chip design. Table lookup based methods are widely used in current industry due to its fast runtime and mature algorithms. Conventional STA algorithms based on table-lookup methods are developed under many assumptions in timing analysis; however, most of those assumptions, such as that input signals and output signals can be accurately modeled as ramp waveforms, are no longer satisfactory to meet the increasing demand of accuracy for new technologies. In this dissertation, we discuss several crucial issues that conventional STA has not taken into consideration, and propose new methods to handle these issues and show that new methods produce accurate results. In logic circuits, gates may have multiple inputs and signals can arrive at these inputs at different times and with different waveforms. Different arrival times and waveforms of signals can cause very different responses. However, multiple-input transition effects are totally overlooked by current STA tools. Using a conventional single-input transition model when multiple-input transition happens can cause significant estimation errors in timing analysis. Previous works on this issue focus on developing a complicated gate model to simulate the behavior of logic gates. These methods have high computational cost and have to make significant changes to the prevailing STA tools, and are thus not feasible in practice. This dissertation proposes a simplified gate model, uses transistor connection structures to capture the behavior of multiple-input transitions and requires no change to the current STA tools.Another issue with table lookup based methods is that the load of each gate in technology libraries is modeled as a single lumped capacitor. But in the real circuit, theAbstract2gate connects to its subsequent gates via metal wires. As the feature size of integrated circuit scales down, the interconnection cannot be seen as a simple capacitor since the resistive shielding effect will largely affect the ""equivalent"" capacitance seen from the gate. As the interconnection has numerous structures, tabulating the timing data for various interconnection structures is not feasible. In this dissertation, by using the concept of equivalent admittance, we reduce an arbitrary interconnection structure into an equivalent ?-model RC circuit. Many previous works have mapped the ?-model to an effective capacitor, which makes the table lookup based methods useful again. However, a capacitor cannot be equivalent to a ?-model circuit, and will thus result in significant inaccuracy in waveform evaluation. In order to obtain an accurate waveform at gate output, a piecewise waveform evaluation method is proposed in this dissertation. Each part of the piecewise waveform is evaluated according to the gate characteristic and load structures. Another contribution of this dissertation research is a proposed equivalent waveform search method. The signal waveforms can be very complicated in the real circuits because of noises, race hazards, etc. The conventional STA only uses one attribute (i.e., transition time) to describe the waveform shape which can cause significant estimation errors. Our approach is to develop heuristic search functions to find equivalent ramps to approximate input waveforms. Here the transition time of a final ramp can be completely different from that of the original waveform, but we can get higher accuracy on output arrival time and transition time. All of the methods mentioned in this dissertation require no changes to the prevailing STA tools, and have been verified across different process technologies."
soc_etd_74,Gender Regimes in Finance: The Social Organization of Money Work,Sociology,"Finance, Gender, Work","Informed by intersectional theory and gendered organizational studies, this dissertation uses qualitative interviews with 35 money workers to analyze gender inequality in the financial services industry. Within this field, I examine how local workplace practices and broader economic trends produce gendered performances and organize the money work that is performed by financial services employees. Specifically, I compare the labor processes and organizational practices at large wire houses versus small and independent firms and explore how the ""gender regime"" is built into the social organization of money work. The research focuses on answering the following questions: (1) How is a ""gender regime"" built into the social organization of money work at large wire houses versus small and independent firms? (2) What type of work culture is valued at large wire houses versus small and independent firms and how are gendered performances produced by the demands of the local workplace context? (3) In what ways is the ""Great Recession"" impacting the gendered performances of financial services workers and the social organization of money work? My findings demonstrate that the organizational practices of large wire houses are more detrimental to woman working in the field. Specifically, the compensation structure, gender discretion and bias by senior male employees, and the organization of partnerships at these firms contribute to the gender wage gap and are advantageous to men working at these organizations. While I could find no industry-wide statistics to demonstrate that small and independent firms have more gender equality, based on my findings, it appears that the small and independent firms are less likely to have labor processes that explicitly disadvantage women. My findings also demonstrate that the type of organization (large wire house versus small and independent firms) impacts the overall work culture and impacts the type of gender performance that is produced. At large wire houses, workers refer to the atmosphere as a ""boy's club,"" that views men as naturally better equipped to be financial advisors. These organizations construct a competent advisor as one who performs in ways that are aligned with traditional constructions of masculinity. However, small and independent firms demonstrate that there are alternative ways to do money work. Workers describe a culture that is more egalitarian. To be viewed as a competent advisor at a smaller firm, advisors are expected to ""build relationships with clients"" and ""give good advice."" Competence is not constructed in masculine terms; therefore, gendered performances for workers are more flexible. Findings also suggest that the ""Great Recession"" is impacting the social organization of gender at financial services firms. In particular, the economic downturn is contributing to increased pressure to conform to transnational business masculinities at large wire houses as well as encouraging emphasized femininity at small and independent firms. Global capitalism and the economic retraction is contributing to what Acker (2006) describes as the ""inequality regime."" While women advisors are disadvantaged relative to men, particularly at large wire houses, my results also indicate that the recession perpetuates inequality between female money workers. As job insecurity and the demands of the work have increased, women in advisory and management positions are outsourcing their labor, particularly their domestic and administrative work, to other women in order to succeed. This research contributes to our understandings about how gender inequality is produced in the finance industry, particularly at large wire houses. In addition, it explicates the ways gender is constituted by both the local workplace context and larger economic retraction."
etd_297,Generalization Programming and the Instructional Hierarchy: A Performance Feedback Intervention in Writing,Psychology,"academic intervention, generalization, performance feedback, writing","National assessments have indicated that a large number of students in the United States are underperforming in writing (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012; Persky, Daane, &;; Jin, 2003).  Accordingly, there is a clear need for research to identify appropriate interventions targeting writing.  One intervention that has received empirical support is performance feedback (Van Houten et al., 1974, 1975, 1979).  However, few performance feedback studies have explicitly targeted generalization.  The primary purpose of the current study was to examine the extent to which 116 third-grade students, randomly assigned to a generalization programming (n = 39), performance feedback (n = 38), or practice-only condition (n = 39), demonstrated gains in writing fluency and were able to demonstrate stimulus and response generalization.  It was hypothesized that (a) students in both intervention conditions would significantly outperform the practice-only condition in writing fluency growth and (b) students in the generalization programming condition would demonstrate stronger performance on measures of stimulus and response generalization as a result of explicit programming tactics targeting generalized skills along the sequence of the Instructional Hierarchy (Haring &;; Eaton, 1978).  There was mixed support for the hypotheses, as students in the performance feedback condition demonstrated statistically significant greater writing fluency growth in comparison to both the practice-only and generalization programming conditions.  In comparison to students assigned to practice-only or performance feedback conditions, students assigned to the generalization programming condition demonstrated significantly greater performance on a measure of response generalization; however, there were no differences between the conditions on a measure of stimulus generalization."
etd_79,Geographies of Containment: Logics of Enclosure in Aboriginal and Asylum Seeker Policies in Australia's Northern Territory,Geography,"Aboriginal, Asylum, Containment, Enclosure, Political Geography, Public Policy","In this dissertation, I explore how logics of enclosure underscore policies about national identity, citizenship, and belonging in Australia. Darwin, the capital of Australia's Northern Territory, has become a central place for policy struggles over migration and Aboriginal communities over the past ten years. The city offers a lens through which to read geopolitical processes of migration and detention, sovereignty and citizenship, and settler colonialism and consider their consequences for people's everyday lives. Asylum seekers in Australia face policies of mandatory detention while they wait and hope for refugee status, and Darwin's many immigration detention centers have earned it the name `Detention Capital of Australia.' Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory have also experienced restrictive policies since the 2007 Northern Territory Emergency Response legislation targeted their communities, and Darwin has become the capital of this `Intervention' into Aboriginal communities as well. I argue that these sets of policies reveal a common logic towards policymaking in Australia that relies on containment to engage with populations perceived as threatening to perceptions of Australian nationality. A logic of containment--an approach towards policymaking relying on strategies of enclosure--underscores policies towards asylum seekers and Aboriginal populations. I conclude that similar logics of enclosure, or containment, trap Aboriginal Australians, asylum seekers, and advocates seeking justice, confining their minds and bodies, limiting possibilities for their futures, and revealing the precariousness of their human security in the search for a secure national identity."

Building on the work of literacy studies and computers and writing scholarship, I define and critique ""the digital literacy myth""-a public discourse wherein digital literacies and their technologies are portrayed as inherently democratic for individuals and nations, and are promised to deliver economic competitiveness to those who can attain and best leverage them. I follow the consequences of the digital literacy myth, showing how the myth shapes One-Third World responses to transnational moments of struggle in the case of the 2009 Iranian election protests and the recent decades of rape related to conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Using a transnational feminist analytic to trace transnational networks of literacy and materiality, I argue that the digital literacy myth frames how One-Third World citizens are likely to read and participate in global events. And, I note the ways in which US neoliberal interests have historically invested in the digital literacy myth in order to serve their economic agenda. Lastly, I address how, as ethical writing teachers, we might balance teaching our students the digital literacies of today's economy while remaining aware of the costs of those literacies in the global era."
etd_240,Governing through Health: The Biomedical and Public Health Management of Drug Using Bodies,Sociology,"addiction, drug use, governmentality, harm reduction, health, qualitative methods","Focused on the intersection of health, drug use, and poverty, this dissertation closely examines the use of discursive registers in the conceptualization of health among low-income people who inject drugs in New York City. Using qualitative in-depth interviews with 40 people who inject drugs, 13 health care practitioners who provide care for drug-using patients, and 4 researchers of drug use, the governmentality of a public health risk population--people who inject drugs--is traced. To historicize this population a genealogy of the ""injection drug user"" is conducted through the examination of public health research publications from the 1980s and historical literature on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This dissertation sought to answer such questions as: How did the emergence in the 1980s of the ""injection drug user"" function as an act of governmentality? How do health care practitioners understand drug use among their patients and what are the implications of these understandings for the management of their health and their selves? How have risk discourse and particularly harm reduction discourse produced concepts of health and governed the bodies of low-income people who inject drugs? And, what can be done about health concerns that fall outside of risk discourse? The findings of this dissertation interrogate discourses of risk, such as harm reduction, and the discourse of addiction as disease by pointing to the narratives of illness offered by people who inject drugs. These narratives reveal that these individuals prioritize chronic health conditions from which they currently suffer over concerns of risk for infectious disease or the disease of addiction. Despite this, people who inject drugs are entangled in a complicated web of power through bio-political discourses of risk and disease that renders them subjects of disciplinary and pastoral technologies of power."

Often expressed with the phrase `in virtue of', ground has recently found some popularity among metaphysicians. In this dissertation I argue that the notion is well understood and useful, but not primitive. I argue that we should analyze ground partly in terms of relative fundamentality. This analyzed notion of ground can not only do the work that a primitive notion can, but it is better equipped to respond to a number of objections and challenges that the notion faces. The dissertation ends by demonstrating this is the case and responding to objections."
ppa_etd_85,Hands in the Pockets of Mercurial Donors: How Three Theories Explain Ngo Responses to Shifting Funding Priorities,Public Administration,"Donors, Hirschman's Typology, Lebanon, NGOs, Resource Dependence, Weak Ties","The NGO-donor relationship has become understood as exceptionally volatile. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in developing countries rely heavily on foreign donor funding and potential over-reliance on donors becomes apparent. The research at hand concentrates on the relationship between environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international donor agencies in the local setting of a developing country. It explores the potential impact of changing funding priorities on NGO behavior and decision-making. It raises two questions: How do NGOs respond to changes in donor funding objectives? Why do NGOs react the way they do?NGOs react to changes in the external environment in different ways (Thompson 1967; Pfeffer and Salancik 1978; Scott 1981; Pfeffer 1982). The first phase of the dissertation explores the NGO-donor relationship when donors revise funding priorities and partner NGOs try to adapt. There is a variation in the way NGOs respond to changes in funding manifested or applied in a variety of ways. The study draws on qualitative research to study the decisions of four NGOs in response to shifts in funding, and analysis reveals the following variations in NGO responses to such shifts: suspend the relationship, reach common ground and maintain the relation, automatically execute the donor's interests, and voluntarily and deliberately adapt to the situation. The research builds on Hirschman's (1970) individual self-interest theory and considers NGOs as `consumers' in their relationship with donor agencies. Using Hirschman's (1970) typology, three modes of NGOs' response are identified: exit, voice, loyalty, and a fourth mode, adjustment, is proposed.Furthermore, the dissertation integrates resource dependence theory (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978) and the theory of weak ties (Granovetter 1973, 1983) to construct a more parsimonious theory to predict organizational responses to changes in the surrounding environment. Each of the two theories is reviewed separately to provide a theoretical justification for NGO behavior in a changing funding environment. Resource dependence determines NGO behavior. Therefore, we expect that NGOs characterized with high resource dependency will comply with donor interests. Furthermore, the behavior of the NGO could also be determined by the presence of strong or weak ties, such that an NGO centrally located in a dense network with strong ties is likely to comply with donor interests.This investigation also recognizes that organizations vary in terms of tolerance for resource dependency and the nature and structures of their network relations. The study accepts Salancik's (1995) argument that control over resources is not the only source of power in an inter-organizational relationship; network positions are related to power. Accordingly, the study presents an alternative perspective that integrates the two theories, stipulating that an organizational response to changes in its external environment depends on the level of resource dependence tolerance as well as the strength of ties in a network of actors. The likelihood of an organization adopting exit as a response to shifts in donor funding is higher with lower resource dependence and weaker network ties. The likelihood of an organization practicing voice is higher with lower resource dependence and stronger ties. The likelihood of an organization practicing adjustment is higher with higher resource dependence and weaker network ties. Lastly, the likelihood of an organization adopting loyalty as a response to shifts in donor funding is higher with higher resource dependence and stronger ties.The integrated theory is supported with in-depth qualitative analysis of multiple cases of NGOs and their relations with stakeholders, specifically donors. It is verified by translating propositions into hypotheses. These key hypotheses are tested using multinomial regression analysis based on measurements derived from network analysis that plots network maps of environmental NGOs in Lebanon. The results provide good support for the predictions of the integrated theory. Variation in resource dependence has no effect on the choice of voice over exit, while higher centrality increases the tendency towards voice. There is a higher tendency for adjustment with higher resource criticality and concentration while tie strength has a weak effect on the choice of adjustment over exit."
etd_718,Harbor Seal (Phoca vitulina) Reproductive Advertisement Behavior And The Effects Of Vessel Noise,Biology,"acoustics, animal behavior, animal communication, anthropogenic noise, harbor seals, marine mammals","Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are a widely distributed pinniped species that mate underwater.  Similar to other aquatically mating pinnipeds, male harbor seals produce vocalizations during the breeding season that function in male-male interactions and possibly as an attractant for females.  I investigated multiple aspects of these reproductive advertisement displays in a population of harbor seals in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska.  First, I looked at vocal production as a function of environmental variables, including season, daylight, and tidal state.  Vocalizations were highly seasonal and detection of these vocalizations peaked in June and July, which correspond with the estimated time of breeding.  Vocalizations also varied with light, with the lowest probability of detection during the day and the highest probability of detection at night.  The high probability of detection corresponded to when females are known to forage.  These results are similar to the vocal behavior of previously studied populations.  However, unlike previously studied populations, the detection of harbor seal breeding vocalizations did not vary with tidal state.  This is likely due to the location of the hydrophone, as it was not near the haul out and depth was therefore not significantly influenced by changes in tidal height.  I also investigated the source levels and call parameters of vocalizations, as well as call rate and territoriality.  The average source level of harbor seal breeding vocalizations was 144 dB re 1 ?Pa at 1 m and measurements ranged from 129 to 149 dB re 1 ?Pa.  Analysis of call parameters indicated that vocalizations of harbor seals in Glacier Bay were similar in duration to other populations, but were much lower in frequency.  During the breeding season, there were two discrete calling areas that likely represent two individual males; the average call rate in these display areas was approximately 1 call per minute.  The harbor seal breeding season also overlaps with peak tourism in Glacier Bay, and the majority of tourists visit the park on a motorized vessel.  Because of this overlap, I investigated the impacts of vessel noise on the vocal behavior of individual males.  In the presence of vessel noise, male harbor seals increase the amplitude of their vocalizations, decrease the duration, and increase the minimum frequency.  These vocal shifts are similar to studies of noise impacts on other species across taxa, but it is unknown how this could impact the reproductive success of male harbor seals.  Finally, I looked at the role of female preference for male vocalizations.  Using playbacks of male vocalizations to captive female harbor seals, I found that females have a higher response to vocalizations that correspond to dominant males.  Females were less responsive to subordinate male vocalizations, which had a shorter duration and a higher frequency.  Given that male harbor seals decrease the duration and increase the frequency of vocalizations in the presence of noise, it is possible that these vocalizations become less attractive in noise."

The majority of college students engage in hookup behavior, but little is known about the health consequences of hookups. This longitudinal study examined the effects of sexual hookups on mental health and risk for sexual victimization (SV) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among first-year college women. It was hypothesized that sexual hookup behavior would negatively affect women's mental health and increase their likelihood of experiencing SV and STDs. Participants (N = 483) completed 13 monthly online surveys that assessed sexual behavior (performing oral sex, receiving oral sex, and vaginal sex) with casual and romantic partners, mental health outcomes, SV, and self-reported STD diagnoses. Participants were also tested for three STDs at the end of the academic year. Hookup behavior involving either oral or vaginal sex was reported by 34% prior to college and 40% during the year-long study. Multivariate latent growth curve modeling showed that increases in the probability of oral sex (performed) and vaginal sex hookup behavior during the academic year were associated with increases in perceived stress and decreases in positive affect. Compared to women who did not hook up during the study, women who hooked up were more likely to experience SV, even after controlling for several risk factors for SV and sex in the context of romantic relationships. Engaging in any sexual hookup behavior during the study was not predictive of acquiring a new STD, but power for this logistic regression analysis was limited due to the low base rate of STDs. Lifetime history of sexual hookup behavior was significantly associated with lifetime STD diagnosis. Overall, the results suggest that sexual hookup behavior leads to increased psychological distress for some women and increases risk of experiencing SV and STDs."

With data from the New Immigrant Survey (2003), which includes immigrants from Mexico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Jamaica, I examine the odds of three health outcomes, chronic conditions, depressive symptoms, and fair or poor self-rated health using a series of logistic regression analyses. I draw on segmented assimilation and the cumulative inequality theories to understand and explicate the extent to which immigrants’ demographic characteristics, pre-immigration experiences, and acculturation in the U.S. might have an impact on immigrants’ health outcomes. Compared to Mexican immigrants, I find evidence to support that Cuban and Jamaican immigrants have significantly higher odds of reporting chronic conditions and Dominican Republic and Cuban immigrants report higher odds of depressive symptoms, while Haitian immigrants have lower odds of depressive symptoms. Female immigrants have higher odds of reporting all three health outcomes compared to their male counterparts. Relative to immigrants with good childhood health, those with unfavorable childhood health have higher odds of reporting worse health outcomes. In the logistic regression models, age of migration is not a major predictor of chronic conditions, however, immigrants who migrated at older age report higher odds of depressive symptoms and fair or poor self-rated health. Acculturation is not a significant predictor of chronic conditions and depressive symptoms. However, immigrants who are acculturated have lower odds of reporting fair or poor self-rated health than those who are not. By shedding light on the health status of understudied Caribbean immigrant groups in comparison with Mexican immigrants, this study serves as a starting point to guide policies that aim at decreasing health disparities among different immigrant groups."

A series of complexes were prepared and characterized. The neutral co-ligands tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane are introduced as both solvents and Lewis basic donors. Ligand size effects are examined with the introduction of the bulkier azobenzene derivatives MesN=NPh and MesN=NMes (Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2). The fine structure details obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction allowed for the systematic study of primary ligand coordination modes, the quantity and mode of co-ligand coordination, and, finally, the nature and extent of secondary interactions, with respect to trends in metal size. We are able to closely examine the factors present that impart additional stabilization to these highly reactive species.In the latter part of this thesis, with a focus on MOCVD applications, the perfluoro-t-butoxide (PFTB) ligand is used to prepare a set of novel bismuth alkoxides. These complexes were compared to other bismuth alkoxides and early lanthanide alkoxides in both their structural and thermal properties. Using an adaptation of a previously published pathway, a number of novel bismuth compounds have been synthesized; this synthetic route has since been shown to be fruitful herein and results have been obtained with a related ligand system by a colleague. The pathway may prove a more general route to produce bismuth containing targets."

It draws from institutional theory and organizational institutionalism, and contributes to organization theory, corporate social responsibility, gender, and initial public offering literatures.  In the two chapters that make up this dissertation, I theorize and empirically show that the institutional context varies not only between countries or groups of countries, but also domestically; and this variation has a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact on organizations.  In the first chapter of this dissertation I focus on a market transaction, initial public offerings (IPO), and show that a change in institutional context leads to a lower IPO performance due to high financial uncertainty; in the second chapter, the focus is on a non-market transaction, corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices.  This chapter theorizes and empirically shows that women in high executive roles as well as states that are governed by the Democratic Party lead to higher CSR activities, and state’s ‘color’ moderates the relationship between gender and CSR."
etd_390,Heterogeneous Sensor Signal Processing for Inference with Nonlinear Dependence,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Copula Theory, Dependent observations, Detection, Estimation, Sensor Fusion","Inferring events of interest by fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources has been an interesting and important topic in recent years. Several issues related to inference using heterogeneous data with complex and nonlinear dependence are investigated in this dissertation. We apply copula theory to characterize the dependence among heterogeneous data.In centralized detection, where sensor observations are available at the fusion center (FC), we study copula-based fusion. We design detection algorithms based on sample-wise copula selection and mixture of copulas model in different scenarios of the true dependence. The proposed approaches are theoretically justified and perform well when applied to fuse acoustic and seismic sensor data for personnel detection. Besides traditional sensors, the access to the massive amount of social media data provides a unique opportunity for extracting information about unfolding events. We further study how sensor networks and social media complement each other in facilitating the data-to-decision making process. We propose a copula-based joint characterization of multiple dependent time series from sensors and social media. As a proof-of-concept, this model is applied to the fusion of Google Trends (GT) data and stock/flu data for prediction, where the stock/flu data serves as a surrogate for sensor data.In energy constrained networks, local observations are compressed before they are transmitted to the FC. In these cases, conditional dependence and heterogeneity complicate the system design particularly. We consider the classification of discrete random signals in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), where, for communication efficiency, only local decisions are transmitted. We derive the necessary conditions for the optimal decision rules at the sensors and the FC by introducing a ""hidden"" random variable. An iterative algorithm is designed to search for the optimal decision rules. Its convergence and asymptotical optimality are also proved. The performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated for the distributed Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) problem. Censoring is another communication efficient strategy, in which sensors transmit only ""informative"" observations to the FC, and censor those deemed ""uninformative"". We design the detectors that take into account the spatial dependence among observations. Fusion rules for censored data are proposed with continuous and discrete local messages, respectively. Their computationally efficient counterparts based on the key idea of injecting controlled noise at the FC before fusion are also investigated.In this thesis, with heterogeneous and dependent sensor observations, we consider not only inference in parallel frameworks but also the problem of collaborative inference where collaboration exists among local sensors. Each sensor forms coalition with other sensors and shares information within the coalition, to maximize its inference performance. The collaboration strategy is investigated under a communication constraint. To characterize the influence of inter-sensor dependence on inference performance and thus collaboration strategy, we quantify the gain and loss in forming a coalition by introducing the copula-based definitions of diversity gain and redundancy loss for both estimation and detection problems. A coalition formation game is proposed for the distributed inference problem, through which the information contained in the inter-sensor dependence is fully explored and utilized for improved inference performance."

The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, 81 teachers responded to a questionnaire about their beliefs regarding the use of graphing calculators in the teaching and learning of linear and quadratic functions. Six of these teachers then participated in the second phase involving task-based interviews and classroom observations.A major finding from the survey was a possible link between teachers' frequency of calculator use and their views regarding sequencing of function representations. I found that low frequency users held the view that algebraic symbols should always precede tables while high frequency users did not hold a similar view. Teachers in this study were also split on which type of tasks students should be allowed to use graphing calculators. Some teachers stated that they would encourage their students to use the graphing calculator when the students felt it was appropriate regardless of the task while others stated that they would always want their students to learn to solve each type of problem with paper and pencil before they could use a calculator.Findings from the interviews and classroom observations highlighted some differences among the moderate and high frequency users in terms of how they guide their classes - teacher direction and student exploration - and the level of direction they provide to their students when working with graphing calculators. In terms of classroom dynamics, I found that classes taught by high frequency users seemed to involve more student exploration than those taught by moderate frequency users. I also found that when lessons were characterized by teacher direction, the graphing calculator was used as a computational tool and when lessons were characterized by student exploration, the graphing calculator was used as a visualizing tool and checking tool."
etd_569,High-energy Neutron Backgrounds for Underground Dark Matter Experiments,Physics,,"Direct dark matter detection experiments usually have excellent capability to distinguish nuclear recoils, expected interactions with Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter, and electronic recoils, so that they can efficiently reject background events such as gamma-rays and charged particles. However, both WIMPs and neutrons can induce nuclear recoils. Neutrons are then the most crucial background for direct dark matter detection. It is important to understand and account for all sources of neutron backgrounds when claiming a discovery of dark matter detection or reporting limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section. One type of neutron background that is not well understood is the cosmogenic neutrons from muons interacting with the underground cavern rock and materials surrounding a dark matter detector.The Neutron Multiplicity Meter (NMM) is a water Cherenkov detector capable of measuring the cosmogenic neutron flux at the Soudan Underground Laboratory, which has an overburden of 2090 meters water equivalent. The NMM consists of two 2.2-tonne gadolinium-doped water tanks situated atop a 20-tonne lead target. It detects a high-energy (> ~ 50 MeV) neutron via moderation and capture of the multiple secondary neutrons released when the former interacts in the lead target. The multiplicity of secondary neutrons for the high-energy neutron provides a benchmark for comparison to the current Monte Carlo predictions. Combining with the Monte Carlo simulation, the muon-induced high-energy neutron flux above 50 MeV is measured to be (1.3 ± 0.2) × 10^{?9} cm^{?2}s^{?1}, in reasonable agreement with the model prediction. The measured multiplicity spectrum agrees well with that of Monte Carlo simulation for multiplicity below 10, but shows an excess of approximately a factor of three over Monte Carlo prediction for multiplicities ~ 10 - 20.In an effort to reduce neutron backgrounds for the dark matter experiment SuperCDMS SNOLAB, an active neutron veto was developed. It is estimated that the current design of the neutron veto with a 40 cm thick layer of boron-doped liquid scintillator can achieve a >90% efficiency for tagging the single-scatter neutrons.

In this current era of dramatic change, this qualitative study aimed to understand: How do professionals in high-performing schools make sense of co-teaching in the face of accountability policies?  The special education service of co-teaching was utilized as a proxy of inclusive schooling in order to have a tangible access point for educators and leaders to share their experiences.  A focus on three high-performing schools addressed a void of school improvement research by shining a light of inquiry on these distinct school cultures grounded in high expectations and competition (The Aspen Institute, 2014; Galloway, Conner & Pope, 2013).  Data gathered through observation and semi-structured interview were analyzed within a blended framework of grounded theory, symbolic interactionism and situational analysis.  Concepts of organizational identity construction and policy sense-making further illuminated the findings that these high-performing schools had a unique Blue Ribbon identity that symbolized achievement and prestige and allowed space for marginalization, that a lack of understanding or commitment to inclusion was frequently communicated through resistance, and that there were multiple themes of dissonance that existed as these schools struggled to be inclusive.  Findings are relevant to the researcher’s own reflective practice as a school leader and as a vehicle to insight candid dialogue and further research regarding high-performing school identities and the praxis of accountability policies and inclusive practice.Keywords: co-teaching, high-performing schools, high-stakes accountability, inclusion, organizational identity construction, policy sense-making"

Initial qualitative findings from focus groups (n = 18) indicated that several key elements of stigmatizing treatment experiences included judgmental and condescending language, patient avoidance, increased physical distance between patient and provider during conversations and procedures, and use of extra, unnecessary precautions (e.g. use of extra gloves, masks). These provider behaviors were experimentally manipulated and incorporated into computerized vignettes containing audio and visual stimuli depicting ""typical"" medical appointments. In the experimental phase, participants (n = 90) were randomly assigned to view either a highly stigmatizing or a non-stigmatizing treatment vignette and then subsequently rate their willingness to engage in HIV care. Findings indicated that patients assigned to the highly stigmatizing condition were the most unwilling to engage in HIV care as demonstrated in lower intentions to remain in care, disclose sexual and substance use risk behaviors, and discuss medication adherence difficulties. As hypothesized, the effect of the experimental stigma condition on patients' willingness to engage in care was mediated by patients' feelings of comfort and their perceptions of stigma within the patient-provider interaction. Findings from the present study may help to inform the development of interventions to assist healthcare providers in creating more positive treatment experiences for their HIV+ patients to improve implementation of self care and reduction of risk behaviors."
mat_etd_71,Holomorphic Fundamental Semigroup of Riemann Domains,Mathematics,,"Let (W, Pi) be a Riemann domain over a complex manifold M and w0 be a point in W. Let D be the unit disk in the complex plane and T be the unit circle. Consider the space S1,w0 (D,W,M) of continuous mappings f of T into W such that f(1)=w0 and Pi circ f extends to a holomorphic mapping hat f on D. Mappings f0, f1 in S1,w0 (D, W, M) are called holomorphically homotopic or h-homotopic if there is a continuous mapping ft of [0,1] into S1,w0(D, W, M). Clearly, the h-homotopy is an equivalence relation and the equivalence class of f in S1,w0(D, W, M) will be denoted by [f] and the set of all equivalence classes by ?1(W, M, w0).There is a natural mapping iota1: ?1(W, M, w0) to pi1(W, w0) generated by assigning to f in S1,w0(D, W, M) its restriction to T. We introduce on ?1(W, M, w0) a binary operation * which induces on ?1(W, M, w0) a structure of a semigroup with unity and show that ?1(W, M, w0) is an algebraic biholomorphic invariant of Riemann domains. Moreover, iota1([f1] * [f2]) = iota1 ([f1]) cdot iota1 ([f2]), where cdot is the standard operation on pi1(W, w0). Then we establish standard properties of ?1(W, M, w0) and provide some examples. When W is a finitely connected domain in the complex plane and Pi is the identity, we show that iota1 is an isomorphism of ?1(W, M, w0) onto the minimal subsemigroup of pi1(W, w0) containing some specific generators and invariant with respect to the inner automorphisms. For a general domain W in the complex plane we prove that [f1]=[f2] if and only if iota1([f1]) = iota_1([f2]) which is the manifestation of the homotopic Oka principle."

This study also explored the extent to which mothers' instructional and affective quality related and interacted as they relate to Taiwanese 3-to-6-year-old children's early literacy development. Moreover, this study explored whether the pattern of these relationships differed as a function of children's home literacy environment. Results showed that Taiwanese mothers showed a tendency to use interactive shared book reading style, to convey moral and social rules, and to use a scaffolding-like procedure, and performed observable behaviors that were rated as high to medium in affective quality during shared book reading interactions. Taiwanese children exhibited nine emergent reading behaviors. In addition, from direct effects model, a great length of time of shared book reading was found to be strongly associated with high level of maternal instructional quality during shared book reading activity, and a higher level of instructional quality used by mothers was found to be strongly associated with children's higher emergent reading skills. In the interaction effects model, mothers' instructional quality moderated the association between affective quality and receptive language ability and between affective quality and concepts of print. The home literacy environment moderated the association between mothers' instructional and affective quality when engaged in shared book reading and Taiwanese 3-to-6-year-old children's receptive language ability."
etd_109,HOME-VISITATION AND PARENT EDUCATION: THE IMPACT ON HOME-BASED SHARED READING DURING KINDERGARTEN,Teaching and Leadership,,"All families engage in a range of social practices involving elements of literacy. These practices may be more or less similar to those promoted in school settings. The ways in which family literacy practices mirror those of the school often begin to be revealed as children participate in formal programs. The purpose of conducting this study is to identify how parental involvement in a comprehensive, literacy focused parenting education program results in school readiness and achievement for children and improved parenting skills.An explanatory mixed methods design is used to determine both the impact and meaning of 48 parents and their children who were involved in the program. Quantitative methods are employed to determine the differences and interaction between home-visitation program involvement and a child's school readiness and performance. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with four Kindergarten families in an effort to discern what involvement in the PACT program meant for these families.This study suggests that children whose parents are involved with the PACT program demonstrate greater readiness for Kindergarten and academic performance in Kindergarten than families that are not involved in the program. The depth of parental engagement in the PACT program promotes greater school readiness than does the extent to which parents consistently attend home visits. Parents involved in PACT shared that their engagement in the program was heavily dependent upon the relationships developed between the family and the parent educator. Parenting skills that were developed reflected both the objectives of the program and more subtle features of parenting. The results of this study provide additional insight into future research on home-visitation programs and school district practices related to parental engagement."
etd_525,"Housing Demand, Housing Wealth, and Public Policy",Economics,"Homeownership, Household Formation, Housing Policy","This dissertation comprises three papers on housing demand, housing wealth, and public policy. The first two papers make use of veteran access to the VA Loan Guaranty Program during the post-war housing boom during the 1940s and 1950s. The findings show that, for both World War II and Korean War veterans, access to the VA loan program promoted household formation. Specifically, access to the program increased an individual’s probability of both marriage and homeownership relative to comparable individuals who did not have access to the program. The third paper analyzes the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005’s change in the status of housing equity as a protected asset in determining Medicaid long-term care payment eligibility. The impact of the policy on the housing equity holdings of individuals likely to require long-term care is estimated across three dimensions: before versus after the policy change, above versus below the eligibility cutoff, and a variety of self-reported health measures. The findings show that the policy induced individuals above the policy cutoff who were likely to require long-term care to hold less housing equity than comparable individuals who were either below the eligibility cutoff or did not report a health measure."

Secondary social studies teachers' understandings of global awareness and global education",Teaching and Leadership,"""American exceptionalism"", ""global education"", ""global history"", post-colonial education, ""social studies education"", ""social studies teaching""","Although global history has been a part of the discipline of social studies in New York State for a number of years, the inclusion of global education and skills has been less prevalent in the discipline.  This lack of global perspectives in education has proven to be detrimental to the global awareness of American students. (Roper for National Geographic Foundation, 2006; Harvard University, 2004; Holm and Farber, 2002; Clarke, 2004).   Global history teachers play a key role in the dissemination of global content that may contribute to increasing global awareness of students.  Yet teachers, themselves, may have limited global awareness and intercultural experiences that impact the ways in which they teach global history.   Therefore, this dissertation examined how global history teachers in upstate New York construct their global awareness and the content they teach, and how their understandings of global education impact their teaching.Eight global history teachers in five school districts took part in this study.  Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and observations, and was informed by theoretical work around colonialism and post-colonialism/post-nationalism.   Results of this study revealed that these teachers saw their worldviews as evolving constructs, shaped by upbringing, cross-cultural interactions, travel experiences, media influences, and professional responsibilities.  Certain global education elements infused their teaching, such as local/global connections, perspectives consciousness, and cultural sensitivity, but the inclusion of such elements was uneven.  Furthermore, their language in many cases revealed an incomplete understanding of global education and cultural awareness.  Elements of colonialism, essentialism, and American exceptionalism were both challenged and reinforced in the ways in which these teachers spoke about their global understandings, and the history content and students they taught."
etd_145,HOW CONTEXT MATTERS IN DIGITAL LIBRARY USE,Information Science and Technology,"Case study, Digital libraries, Organizational context, Social actor, Technology-in-practice","This research investigates how organizational context contributes to the use of digital libraries, an ICT-enabled information infrastructure. Traditionally digital-library use is measured with the help of statistical analysis of download and other related data, but statistics alone have limited power to explain how such an expensive information infrastructure is used to meet organizational goals. Such limitation was overcome in this study by relating digital-library use to the context of such use.In the last decade many Indian research organizations have witnessed the abundance of such information infrastructures accessible directly by end-users. The convergence of several phenomena such as current business models for digital resources, improved ICT infrastructure within organizations and several government interventions to help organizations have made this possible. Because of this recent change, the study was conducted in two Indian research organizations to understand how their respective contexts shape digital library use.This qualitative study used two theoretical constructs -- social actor (Lamb & Kling, 2003) and technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000). The lens of social actor helped to look beyond the boundary of an organization in order to identify entities that reside in its environment and create information demands on the members of the organization. Information demands from those entities, making up organizational context, often pressure the members to use digital libraries. Consequently digital-library uses acquire various meanings depending on the nature and power position of those entities with respect to the members. The premise of the other lens used - technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000) - is often for a technology use, the centrality does not lie in its technical capabilities, rather various other factors outweigh such capabilities resulting into a specific pattern of its use. In this study, this lens helped to identify several environmental, technological, organizational and personal factors that contribute to very limited use patterns of digital libraries.The study contributed to our understanding of digital library use beyond merely measuring downloaded data from database companies. It goes further to describe organizational context in terms of several components and how such components often create workplace demands resulting to digital library use. It also explains how some of the contextual aspects can outweigh the technical capabilities of digital libraries leading to certain use patterns."
etd_684,"HOW DO NOVICE AND EXPERT LEARNERS REPRESENT, UNDERSTAND, AND DISCUSS GEOLOGIC TIME?",Science Teaching,"discourse analysis, expert, funds of knowledge, geologic time, geoscience, novice","This dissertation examined the representations novice and expert learners constructed for the geologic timescale. Learners engaged in a three-part activity. The purpose was to compare novice learners’ representations to those of expert learners. This provided insight into the similarities and differences between their strategies for event ordering, assigning values and scale to the geologic timescale model, as well as their language and practices to complete the model. With a qualitative approach to data analysis informed by an expert-novice theoretical framework grounded in phenomenography, learner responses comprised the data analyzed. These data highlighted learners’ metacognitive thoughts that might not otherwise be shared through lectures or laboratory activities. Learners’ responses were analyzed using a discourse framework that positioned learners as knowers. Novice and expert learners both excelled at ordering and discussing events before the Phanerozoic, but were challenged with events during the Phanerozoic. Novice learners had difficulty assigning values to events and establishing a scale for their models. Expert learners expressed difficulty with determining a scale because of the size of the model, yet eventually used anchor points and unitized the model to establish a scale. Despite challenges constructing their models, novice learners spoke confidently using claims and few hedging phrases indicating their confidence in statements made. Experts used more hedges than novices, however the hedging comments were made about more complex conceptions. Using both phenomenographic and discourse analysis approaches for analysis foregrounded learners’ discussions of how they perceived geologic time and their ways of knowing and doing. This research is intended to enhance the geoscience community’s understanding of the ways novice and expert learners think and discuss conceptions of geologic time, including the events and values of time, and the strategies used to determine accuracy of scale. This knowledge will provide a base from which to support geoscience curriculum development at the university level, specifically to design activities that will not only engage and express learners’ metacognitive scientific practices, but to encourage their construction of scientific identities and membership in the geoscience community."
etd_408,"HOW MENTAL HEALTH, SOJOURNER ADJUSTMENT, AND DRINKING MOTIVES IMPACT ALCOHOL-RELATED CONSEQUENCES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD",Counseling and Human Services,"alcohol-related consequences, college student drinking, mental health, sojourner adjustment, study abroad","The topic of college student drinking has been widely addressed in the literature. Traditional-aged college students are considered to be an at-risk population in terms of the problematic use of alcohol, putting them at risk for a wide range of negative consequences. College students who study abroad are a sub-group of students who may be vulnerable to increased alcohol-related consequences due to variables associated with being in an unfamiliar environment where alcohol is often more accessible. While previous studies have explored the impact that a range of factors has on alcohol-related consequences for students abroad, none has examined the impact that mental health has on consequences.  The present study sought to address this gap in the literature by sampling college students (N = 157) who were participating in a study abroad program during Spring 2015.  Specifically, it investigated how mental health, sojourner adjustment, and drinking motives impacted alcohol-related consequences for college students studying abroad.  It also explored how mental health changed for students while abroad and how pre-abroad mental health impacted sojourner adjustment for the students. To operationalize the construct of mental health, the Distress Index of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-34 (CCAPS-34: Locke et al., 2012) was used. To operationalize sojourner adjustment, the Sojourner Adjustment Measure (SAM; Pedersen et al., 2011b) was used. To operationalize drinking motives, the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (Cooper, 1994) was used, and to operationalize alcohol-related consequences, the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index modified (RAPI: White & Labouvie, 1989; modifications: Pedersen et al., 2012) was used.Ten research hypotheses guided the study. It was hypothesized that poorer mental health as measured by an elevated Distress Index score (score that falls in the 70th percentile or above) on the CCAPS-34 would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; higher scores on the Social Interaction with Co-nationals subscale of the Sojourner Adjustment Measure would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; higher scores on the Homesickness/Feeling Out of Place subscale of the Sojourner Adjustment Measure would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; higher scores on the Coping Motives subscale of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; higher scores on the Social Motives subscale of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; higher scores on the Conformity Motives subscale of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; higher scores on the Enhancement Motives subscale of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised would be associated with increased alcohol-related consequences; student mental health would decrease while students are abroad as evidenced by increases in Distress Index scores on the CCAPS-34; an elevated score (score that falls in the 70th percentile or above) on the Distress Index of the CCAPS-34 at pre-departure would predict lower sojourner adjustment as demonstrated by higher scores on negative sojourner adjustment scales and lower scores on the positive sojourner adjustment scales; pre-departure CCAPS-34 Distress Index scores that fell in the low range (score that falls below the 34th percentile) would predict sojourner adjustment as demonstrated by higher scores on the positive sojourner adjustment scales and lower scores on the negative sojourner adjustment scales.The hypotheses were partially supported. While elevated scores on the distress index were not specifically associated with increased alcohol-related consequences as hypothesized, findings showed that students who were academically distressed or those who had concerns related to eating or alcohol use were more at risk for alcohol-related consequences. With regards to sojourner adjustment, neither of the negative Sojourner Adjustment Measure scales predicted increased alcohol-related consequences as hypothesized. In terms of the positive Sojourner Adjustment Measure scales, those who reported they had a strong sense of identification with the host culture had statistically significant decreased rates of alcohol-related consequences. Unexpectedly, participants who indicated that they had a high degree of interaction with host nationals had more alcohol-related consequences. Next, students who indicated they drank for social reasons were more likely to experience alcohol-related consequences, whereas students who drank for other reasons were not. While it was hypothesized that mental health would decrease for students while abroad, the results did not support this hypothesis. Results from post-hoc analyses showed that only scores related to eating concerns increased in a statistically significant way for students while abroad. There was an unanticipated statistically significant decrease in social anxiety for participants from pre-abroad to abroad. Finally, results showed that pre-departure distress predicted increased feelings of homesickness once abroad, decreased interaction with both co-nationals and host-nationals, and a decreased sense of identifying with the host culture.The results of this study offer important insight into the experiences of students abroad, particularly with regards to student mental health. Moreover, these results can be used to guide future research and shape study abroad program practices and policies."
com_etd_91,How Much Does This Tick You Off? Online Rejection and Criticism Lead to Negative Affect and Retaliatory Aggression,Mass Communications,"aggression, criticism, media, online, rejection, social media","A three-condition (rejection, criticism, control) single-factor experiment (N = 77) on a mock social-networking site similar to Facebook reveals that even a slight rejection - not being allowed to join groups on the site - lead to increases in self-reported negative affect and retaliation against the site and the rejecting groups compared to a control. Subjects who were accepted into the groups but then criticized experienced the same increases in negative affect and retaliatory aggression, as those who were not allowed to join. In addition, men showed heightened retaliatory aggression compared to women and responded differently to criticism than women. However, no significant effects were found by condition in regard to arousal, physiologically measured affect, attempts to restore relational value, triggered displaced aggression, or feelings associated with ostracism. Findings suggest that while rejection and criticism cause emotional pain, they do not hurt as much as ostracism. Results are discussed in relation to the belongingness hypothesis, sociometer theory, the ostracism model, and face theory. Gender differences are explored using social cognitive theory."

As such, understanding how grazing impacts different aspects of the ecosystem is of especially great importance. This study uses a range of approaches to explore the potentially contrasting effects of grazing across human-managed, livestock-grazed systems and natural, wildlife-grazed systems. The first chapter uses a short-term, small-scale approach in assessing differences across management type in plant community composition following a relaxation of grazing. Results reveal that livestock and wildlife grazers may not be functionally different, but rather exhibit different effects due to the way they are managed (free-ranging vs. herded, etc. which affects grazing pressure and its spatial and temporal distribution). The second study explores how herders make livestock movement decisions and reveals that while individual variation in herd movement decisions is related to factors such as herd size, purpose for keeping livestock, and number of herders, the chief drivers influencing herd movement seem to be limited available grazing space and a lack of options. The third study uncovers global patterns regarding environmental and other influences on grazer effects on soil carbon storage. And finally, the last chapter synthesizes these results and suggests recommendations for policy and management.  These results have implications for rangeland and wildlife management as well as future ecological studies."
etd_120,Hydrochemical Dynamics Under Differing Winter Climate Regimes at the Hubbard Brook Experiment Forest,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"dissolved organic carbon, hydrologic flowpaths, nitrate, soil water, watershed, winter climate change","This dissertation is a two-phase study of the hydrochemical dynamics of drainage waters at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA, that aims to improve understanding of changes in water quality associated with winter climate variation. The first phase was an analysis of the long-term stream and soil water chemistry dataset from Watershed 6, the biogeochemical reference watershed of the HBEF. The second phase was a series of field measurements designed to evaluate variation in the chemistry and hydrology of stream and soil water across a natural gradient of winter climate at the HBEF.Thirty years (1982-2011) of stream and soil water chemistry data were analyzed to assess the trends of overall recovery from acidification, as well as a trends associated with the snowmelt periods of the record, which are characterized by seasonal and episodic acidification of stream runoff. Trends varied by landscape position, but the analysis generally revealed slow increases in the pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in stream water that were associated with decreases in atmospheric deposition of acid anions, sulfate (SO42-) and nitrate (NO3-). Trends during snowmelt were similar to the whole-year record, including ANC recovery. Nitrate concentrations in streamwater during snowmelt decreased more rapidly than the whole-year record. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have declined significantly in most forest floor soil waters, apparently driving a small overall decrease in streamwater DOC at the base of the watershed. The DOC concentration decreases in streamwater occurred primarily in the first 15 years of the record.Soil water chemistry was monitored for two years (2011 and 2012) at a series of 20 plots across the Hubbard Brook valley located to capture variability in winter climate. Variables such as maximum soil frost depth and winter soil temperature variability were positively correlated with increased leaching of DOC, but not NO3-, during the early growing season (May-July). The DOC mobilization was primarily observed in the soil waters draining the forest floor (Oa horizon), and less in the mineral soil (Bs horizon). No effect of winter soil conditions was noted during the late growing season.Daily streamwater sampling during snowmelt was conducted in two south-facing catchments (Watershed 3 and Watershed 6) for three years (2010-2012), and in one north-facing catchment (Watershed 7) for two years (2011-2012). Streamwater concentrations of NO3- and DOC varied among the watersheds and among the years. Nitrate was flushed in high concentration early in snowmelt, prior to dilution. Nitrate was exported in highest concentrations from Watershed 7 during each year, presumably the result of higher microbial nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates. The highest NO3- concentrations in each watershed occurred during snowmelt of 2012, following a winter with low snowpack and above average temperatures. DOC concentrations were largely determined by changes in hydrologic flow, increasing during snowmelt events. The DOC concentration varied among the watersheds and was highly correlated to the winter climate variables for each of the watersheds.End-member mixing analysis (EMMA) revealed differences in hydrologic flowpaths related to the presence of soil frost. Flow through preferential flowpaths in the forest floor was reduced during days with extensive soil frost. Direct contribution of snow or precipitation water to stream flow water was not markedly increased during times when the soils were frozen, indicating that the soil frost was likely granular and soils retained permeability."

In addition, this research investigates the development of properties in these classes of compounds. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that hydrothermal reaction conditions of stoichiometry, pH, and temperature can influence the identity of the products.The structural versatility of the M(I,II)/polyazaheterocycle/anion system for M = Cu(I,II), Co(II), Ni (II), Zn (II), and Cd(II) and where the anion is F-, Cl-, I-, OH-, SO42-, or PO43-, is a reflection of the many structural determinants at play. These include factors such as: (i) the variety of coordination polyhedra available to the metal, (ii) variable modes of coordination associated with the azole(ate) ligands, (iii) the role of functional substituents on the azolate moiety, (iv) the incorporation and coordination preferences of secondary anionic components (Xn- or XOmn-) and (v) the variable incorporation of solvent molecules.The structural chemistry of these materials is quite complex, as evidenced by the range of component substructures observed including a range of chains, layers, frameworks, and embedded metal/azolate clusters. In addition, many of the products exhibited interesting magnetic properties. While a number of recurring structural motifs have been observed, the remarkable array of structures of materials in this study underlines the difficulty in predicting product composition and the challenge in rational design of framework materials. It is anticipated that the continued elaboration of a structural data base for these complex hierarchical materials will evolve into a structural systematic."
etd_192,Hypothesis Testing Using Spatially Dependent Heavy-Tailed Multisensor Data,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Detection, Heavy-tailed signals, Hypothesis testing, Inference, Information fusion, Statistical dependence","The detection of spatially dependent heavy-tailed signals is considered in this dissertation.  While the central limit theorem, and its implication of asymptotic normality of interacting random processes, is generally useful for the theoretical characterization of a wide variety of natural and man-made signals, sensor data from many different applications, in fact, are characterized by  non-Gaussian distributions. A common characteristic observed in non-Gaussian data is the presence of heavy-tails or fat tails. For such data, the probability density function (p.d.f.) of extreme values decay at a slower-than-exponential rate, implying that extreme events occur with greater probability. When these events are observed simultaneously by several sensors, their observations are also spatially dependent. In this dissertation, we develop the theory of detection for such data, obtained through heterogeneous sensors. In order to validate our theoretical results and proposed algorithms, we collect and analyze the behavior of indoor footstep data using a linear array of seismic sensors. We characterize the inter-sensor dependence using copula theory. Copulas are parametric functions which bind univariate p.d.f. s, to generate a valid joint p.d.f.We model the heavy-tailed data using the class of alpha-stable distributions. We consider a two-sided test in the Neyman-Pearson framework and present an asymptotic analysis of the generalized likelihood test (GLRT). Both, nested and non-nested models are considered in the analysis. We also use a likelihood maximization-based copula selection scheme as an integral part of the detection process. Since many types of copula functions are available in the literature, selecting the appropriate copula becomes an important component of the detection problem. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated numerically on simulated data, as well as using indoor seismic data. With appropriately selected models, our results demonstrate that a high probability of detection can be achieved for false alarm probabilities of the order of  10^-4.These results, using dependent alpha-stable signals, are presented for a two-sensor case. We identify the computational challenges associated with dependent alpha-stable modeling and propose alternative schemes to extend the detector design to a multisensor (multivariate) setting. We use a hierarchical tree based approach, called vines, to model the multivariate copulas, i.e., model the spatial dependence between multiple sensors. The performance of the proposed detectors under the vine-based scheme are evaluated on the indoor footstep data, and significant improvement is observed when compared against the case when only two sensors are deployed. Some open research issues are identified and discussed."
etd_20,I Ain't Do Nothing: The Social and Academic Experiences of Black Males in a Dismantled School,Sociology,"Black Males, Critical Race Theory, Hip-Hop, Respect, Urban Schools, Youth Resistance","This dissertation is an ethnographic study of the experiences of Black eighth grade males attending an urban middle school dismantled in the midst of mandated educational reform in a Central New York school district. Some of the students were the victims of repeated school closures and were left behind because of a lack of space in other schools as a result of efforts to disperse students across the district. These students are part of a group that attends classes in a small section of their former building that has been converted into a high school. To gain insight into the lived experiences of these students, the following questions guided this project: How do students analyze and articulate the experiences of being Black males in an urban school and neighborhood as racialized, gendered, and classed individuals? How do students understand, cooperate with, and resist school structure? This project centers the often-silenced voices of Black male youth as experts with the ability to understand and articulate their lived experiences. My analysis revealed student frustrations related to the school setting and relationships with teachers and administrators. Students voiced concerns about respect, relationships with teachers, and the imbalance of voice and power in school. Students articulated feeling more like objects to be controlled than learners to be nurtured. In spite of the oppressive measures put in place to control their behavior, students continued to actively resist efforts to marginalize their existence in the school building. I argue that these students and others should be read as knowledgeable about their own lives and not seen through the lens of ""deficits"" they bring to school. I also argue that in light of social promotion and lowered expectations for academic excellence, for some students, schools become prison preparatory institutions (PPI) and structure experiences for students to be ""pushed out"" and primed to enter the criminal justice system. This work is about finding, recognizing, and engaging students' knowledge and experiences in sociological research and practice."

The Interaction of Saposin B with Antimalarial Drugs,Chemistry,"Atovaquone, Calcium citrate, Chloroquine, CitMHS, Kineococcus, Malaria","The CitMHS protein family is an understudied area of membrane proteins, and yet is an important family regarding basic biological mechanisms.  Organisms have adapted a way to internalize both metals and citrate simultaneously by recognizing and transporting metal-citrate complexes.  The organism studied in this thesis, Kineococcus radiotolerans, has a CitMHS member and will be described and characterized in great detail.  It is shown that calcium citrate is transported more than any other metal-citrate complex tested.Saposin B is a soluble protein that removes damaged coenzyme Q10 from the inner mitochondrial membrane and transports it through the body for excretion.  It also functions to help degrade lipids by binding them and presenting them to arylsulfatase B.  Saposin B may have some unknown mechanisms as well.  Discussed in this thesis is the saposin B binding to the antimalarial agents atovaquone and chloroquine.  Herein is described the possible uses of saposin B as a treatment for chloroquine poisoning, as well as a possible mechanism for how atovaquone is toxic to Plasmodium falciparum, but nontoxic to humans."

Control Bacterial Quorum Sensing and Quorum Sensing-mediated Activities Using Small Unnatural Molecules,Chemistry,"biofilm, chiral nematic, inhibit, liquid crystal, nonamphiphilic, quorum sensing","The primary goal of this research is to utilize organic synthesis as a tool to prepare small molecules that find potential application in different areas including colloidal and material science, biological chemistry, and medicinal chemistry.Chapter 1 describes the interpretation of the conformation of nonamphiphilic mesogen disodium cromoglycate (5´DSCG) when it exists as part of an assembly in water. The study of thermodynamic incompatibility and miscibility suggest that a previously proposed model for the assembly of 5´DSCG may be applicable to nonamphiphilic organic dyes and other mesogens.Chapter 2 presents a study of stereochemical control on assembly and liquid crystal formation by nonamphiphilic molecules. Three stereoisomers of a disodium chromonyl carboxylate derivative, 5´DSCG-diviol, were designed and synthesized. The chiral stereoisomers formed chiral nematic liquid crystals while the achiral counterpart did not form any kind of liquid crystals. The hydrated assemblies of chiral 5´DSCG-diviol were able to interact with each other across a 6 nm separation in aqueous environment and the chirality information was transmitted through achiral medium.Chapter 3 describes the synthesis and biological studies of a class of bicyclic brominated furanones. These molecules interacted with quorum sensing in an opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa. Some representative compounds in this class inhibited quorum sensing-controlled activities such as biofilm formation and virulence factor production, which were key factors in the pathogenicity of the bacteria. These compounds exhibited significant reduction in the toxicity of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and did not inhibit bacterial growth. Furthermore, one compound, 6-BBF, significantly improved P. aeruginosa clearance in the lungs of mice in an immunocompromised pneumonia mouse model in vivo.Chapter 4 reports the synthesis of a library of squarylated homoserine lactones (SHLs) as analogues to the natural autoinducers N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) in Gram-negative bacteria. These SHLs were shown to have no or minimal impact of the growth of P. aeruginosa and V. fischeri, but maintain the abilities to modulate quorum sensing and inhibit biofilm formation. Primary studies of structural activity relationship revealed that the alkyl chain length was critical to activities of SHLs. These SHLs are promising candidates as modulators of other AHL-mediated QS systems."
bio_etd_82,Identification and Characterization of Pathogen Defense Genes of Arabidopsis thaliana,Biology,"Arabidopsis thaliana, chromatin remodeling, microRNA, pathogen defense, Pseudomonas syringae","Plants are constantly under attack from microbes and therefore employ complex and multilayered defense mechanisms to prevent infection. This work reports characterization of defense regulatory genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, including a microRNA, a family of histone demethylases, and a gene of unknown function. The microRNA miR167 was previously found to regulate flower development by controlling patterns of expression of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR genes ARF6 and ARF8. I found that miR167 is differentially expressed in response to treatment with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and that overexpression of miR167 confers very high levels of resistance to the pathogen. The high resistance of miR167 overexpression plants appears to be due to shifts in the balance of hormones to favor those that strengthen defense, and to their tendency to maintain stomata in a closed state, thus preventing entry of bacterial cells into the leaf interior where they can cause disease. This work highlights a new role for a microRNA previously known only for its role in development. I also began characterization of several members of the JumonjiC domain-containing family of histone demethylases. We have previously shown that one member of this family, JMJ27, is required for defense against P. syringae. I identified several other family members that are differentially expressed upon pathogen treatment and two that are critical for defense. Finally, I characterized the TolB-RELATED DEFENSE PROTEIN 1 gene of Arabidopsis. This gene is strongly induced by a variety of pathogens and abiotic stresses and encodes a protein of unknown function. tdp1 knockout mutants did not have altered resistance to P. syringae or oxidative stress, but the high induction of this gene under so many conditions suggests that it plays an important, if not critical, role in stress management."
eecs_etd_334,Identification of a target using its natural poles using both frequency and time domain response,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Singularity expansion method, SEM, natural poles, time domain","A new methodology for detection and identification of unknown objects in free space or on ground, or under the ground is presented in this dissertation. The Singularity Expansion Method (SEM) is introduced because it is possible to find the natural resonant frequencies of a scatterer from the scattered fields and use the resonant frequencies for identification. Many techniques to extract singularities of the EM response of an object are studied and then the Cauchy and the Matrix Pencil (MP) methods are chosen to carry out the processing. In the first part of the dissertation, a methodology for the computation of the natural poles of an object in the frequency domain is presented. The main advantage of this methodology is that there is no need to differentiate between the early time and the late time response of the object as required in the SEM and the Cauchy method can be applied directly to the frequency domain data to extract the SEM poles. Thus, one can generate a library of poles of various objects using the Cauchy method. In the second part of the dissertation, the methodology for detecting and identifying an unknown object in the time domain is also presented. For the simulation model, one transmitter and two receivers (dipole antennas) are utilized to obtain the object response. The received currents of the unknown object are computed by using the deconvolving procedure. The MP method is applied for extracting natural poles of the late time response of the unknown object and the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) technique is utilized to obtain the location of the objects. Therefore, by generating the pole library using the frequency domain data and simultaneous use of the actual poles computed using the time domain data, the correlation between the two pole sets obtained using totally different methodologies can provide a robust identification procedure."
etd_579,Identification of key players in networks using multi-objective optimization and its applications,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Key Players, Multi-objective optimization, Networks","Identification of a set of key players, is of interest in many disciplines such as sociology, politics, finance, economics, etc. Although many algorithms have been proposed to identify a set of key players, each emphasizes a single objective of interest. Consequently, the prevailing deficiency of each of these methods is that, they perform well only when we consider their objective of interest as the only characteristic that the set of key players should have. But in complicated real life applications, we need a set of key players which can perform well with respect to multiple objectives of interest.In this dissertation, a new perspective for key player identification is proposed, based on optimizing multiple objectives of interest. The proposed approach is useful in identifying both key nodes and key edges in networks. Experimental results show that the sets of key players which optimize multiple objectives perform better than the key players identified using existing algorithms, in multiple applications such as eventual influence limitation problem, immunization problem, improving the fault tolerance of the smart grid, etc.We utilize multi-objective optimization algorithms to optimize a set of objectives for a particular application. A large number of solutions are obtained when the number of objectives is high and the objectives are uncorrelated. But decision-makers usually require one or two solutions for their applications. In addition, the computational time required for multi-objective optimization increases with the number of objectives. A novel approach to obtain a subset of the Pareto optimal solutions is proposed and shown to alleviate the aforementioned problems.As the size and the complexity of the networks increase, so does the computational effort needed to compute the network analysis measures. We show that degree centrality based network sampling can be used to reduce the running times without compromising the quality of key nodes obtained."
etd_334,IDENTIFICATION OF SUBSTRATE CHEMICAL GROUPS IMPORTANT FOR GHRELIN O-ACYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY,Chemistry,"acrylodan, enzymology, ghrelin, ghrelin O-acyltransferase, integral membrane protein, membrane bound O-acyltransferase","Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone, expressed primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, which is involved in hunger signaling and energy balance. For ghrelin to bind to and activate its cognate receptor GHSR-1a, it must be octanoylated (C:8 acylated) at serine 3 of its GSSFLS N-terminal sequence.  This acylation is catalyzed by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), a 49 kDa integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ghrelin-mediated stimulation of food intake is well documented, and acyl-ghrelin expression may also impact glucose metabolism. In addition, some studies have proposed ghrelin involvement in learning and memory. Ghrelin maintains a central role in these critical physiological processes, which are disregulated in many diseases including diabetes, Alzheimer's and obesity. Researchers are therefore interested in developing therapeutics targeting the ghrelin-GOAT system. There is extremely limited information available regarding GOAT structure and mechanism, and the enzyme active site in currently unknown. This absence of structural and mechanistic information renders rational design of small molecule GOAT inhibitors difficult. To address this bottleneck in GOAT inhibitor development, I aimed to define the substrate recognition elements utilized by GOAT to bind and modify ghrelin. Towards this goal, I have shown novel expression of human GOAT (hGOAT) in Sf9 insect cells. Using the expression of GOAT from this system, I have screened a number of peptide-based compounds for inhibition of hGOAT and identified a new class of GOAT inhibitors. I have also utilized site-specific mutations at several positions with ghrelin's GOAT recognition motif to identify crucial contact points within the enzyme."
etd_199,Identifying Effective Ways to Increase Teachers' Implementation Integrity through Brief Experimental Analysis,Psychology,,"As a result of recent legislation and research in the area of positive-behavior support, the responsibility of teachers to implement evidence-based interventions in the regular education classroom has increased.  Past research has shown that in many cases interventions were not implemented with integrity, thus limiting the conclusions that could be made regarding a student's response to intervention.  Although provision of scripts, performance feedback, and reinforcement were useful at increasing implementation integrity in previous studies, their effects varied across teachers.  In the present study, a brief experimental analysis (BEA) with a reversal was used to identify the most effective method for increasing the integrity with which 4 regular education teachers implemented a DRA procedure using verbal praise as a reinforcer for student on-task behavior.  An extended analysis using a multiple baseline design across teachers was then conducted to assess the predictive validity of the BEA.  Student on-task behavior was also observed to determine its relationship to teachers' levels of implementation integrity.  Results showed the BEA to be an effective and valid means of identifying an effective support method for 3 of the 4 teacher-student dyads.  Although task engagement increased for all students to above 90%, it correlated with implementation integrity for only 2 of 4 dyads.  Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed."
etd_53,Identifying Extract Class and Extract Method Refactoring Opportunities Through Analysis of Variable Declarations and Uses,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Cohesion Metric, Extract Class Refactoring, Extract Method Refactoring, Graph Theory, Software Refactoring","For small software systems, with perhaps a few thousand lines of code, software structure is largely an esthetic issue. When software systems grow large, including perhaps a million or more lines of source code, their structures become much more important.Developing a large system requires teams of developers working in concert to provide a finished product in a reasonable amount of time. That means that many people will read each component to use, test or modify towards accomplishing new features.In the software development life cycle, the maintenance phase is a dominant stage that impacts production cost of the system dramatically. This is mainly because, for a successful system, the maintenance phase lasts until the system's retirement and includes crucial operations such as enhancing performance, fixing newly discovered bugs and adopting/expending the software to meet new user requirements. Moreover, a software component may be modified or fixed by someone who is not the original author of that component. In this case, all the operations conducted during maintenance or initial development may lead to insertion of code into a unit that may be unrelated to the original design concept of that unit.As software systems become large and complex they grow too long to read and understand completely by a single person. After their initial implementations, maintenance operations tend to make the system even less maintainable, increasing the time and effort needed for future maintenance.In this research, we are interested in finding ways to successfully detect code defects and propose solutions to increase the overall maintainability of software systems that are larger than any one person can completely comprehend from its code alone. This process of refactoring software impacts the total production cost of the system positively by improving the quality of software code such as its comprehensibility and readability.To reduce the total development cost for a system, we suggest three main re-factorings. These novel forms of refactoring techniques aim to eliminate code defects such as large classes and long methods. The main goal of these re-factorings is to create smaller and cohesive software units with clear intentions to improve the maintainability of software.We provide analysis and visualization tools to help a user identify candidate code fragments to be extracted as separate unites. With these automation tools, developers do not have to manually inspect a foreign code base to detect possible refactoring opportunities. Through the visual representations we provide, one can observe all suggested re-factorings effectively on large scale software systems and decide whether a particular refactoring needs to be applied. To show the effectiveness of our techniques, we also provide some experiments conducted using these tools and techniques both on our own project's source code and other open-source projects."
etd_427,IDENTIFYING THE INFLUENCE OF SELECTIVE EPISODES AND MECHANISMS ON REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN TRIBOLIUM CASTANEUM AND DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,Biology,"Drosophila melanogaster, Evolution, Life History, Postcopulatory Sexual Selection, Sexual Selection, Tribolium castaneum","Parsing out what makes some individuals more reproductively successful than others is a key pursuit in evolutionary biology. While reproductive success can ultimately be defined as the number of offspring produced over an individual’s lifetime, there are many selective episodes that shape this outcome. Because the majority of animals have multiple mates, achieving matings is but one influence on reproductive success. After copulation occurs, sperm from multiple males compete within the female reproductive tract to fertilize eggs, while females morphologically or behaviorally bias fertilization to preferred males, further shaping reproductive success. Additionally, the act of mating itself may influence parental lifespan or rate of offspring production. Here, I investigate the influence of multiple selective episodes on different aspects of reproductive success in two insects: the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Established genomes in both systems enabled the generation of transgenic, fluorescently labeled lines: green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a ubiquitin promoter in D. melanogaster to look at paternity in eggs, and GFP or red fluorescent protein (RFP) tagged protamines to identify different male’s sperm by head color in T. castaneum. I investigated relationships between different episodes of reproductive success in D. melanogaster and found positive correlations between sperm competitive success and offspring viability; offspring viability itself was influenced by a male × female interaction on hatching success. In T. castaneum, I explored potential drivers of their extremely promiscuous mating system and how that system influences mechanisms of postcopulatory reproductive success. I found that repeated receipt of a complete ejaculate directly benefits female reproductive success, but comes at a longevity cost to males. This direct benefit of remating to females may explain why I found that the proportion of different male’s sperm in the main chamber of the female reproductive tract, and not the specialized sperm storage organ as in D. melanogaster and many other arthropods, determine the proportion of offspring sired by each male. The great differences in postcopulatory mechanics between D. melanogaster, found previously, and T. castaneum, found here, illustrate the importance of mating system in shaping aspects of reproductive success."
etd_500,Identity Creation and World-Building Through Discourse in Video Game Narratives,"Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics","discourse analysis, gaming, identity, linguistics, literacy, video games","An exploration of how characters develop identity through language use in a video game’s narrative, specifically in video games that do not allow for players to make narrative-altering choices. The concept of literacies is used to create a critical framework through which to view video games themselves as a literacy, as well as to view them as a discourse. This thesis analyzes how dialogue is used to develop and showcase gender, sexuality, personality, moral identity in characters in and out of the player’s control, as well as how dialogue builds the narrative world in which these characters exist. This thesis includes two case studies, on the Borderlands video game series and the Halo video game series, approaching each series from a perspective that showcases how its unique world and characters are created through language.Each series has a specific facet to its narrative that is examined in depth; in the Borderlands series, the importance of storytelling to world-building and moral identity, and in the Halo series, the significance of speech itself as an act. Additionally, Destiny is used as a key supplement to these case studies, as it bridges the gap between the identity-and world-building methods used by Halo and Borderlands. Destiny also incorporates the player’s engagement in an online multiplayer universe, creating a unique type of discourse between the player and the game. Finally, as paratexts affect character identity and world-building within each series, the concept of paratexts as they connect to literacy and narrative is thus also examined as an important facet of identity- and world-building."
phi_etd_71,"Ideology, Truthmaking and Fundamentality",Philosophy,Metaphysics,"In chapter 1 I outline two conceptions of ideology: ideological pessimism and ideological realism. Ideological pessimism is the view that ideological inquiry has dim prospects insofar as ideology is tied to meaning. Ideological realism is the view that there is a fact of the matter about which ideology is taken as primitive when attempting to describe reality correctly. I respond to an argument on behalf of ideological pessimism, develop ideological realism, and then defend it against an objection that attempts to derive the unpalatable consequence that a main dispute in the metaphysics of properties is verbal.In chapter 2 I argue that we should uphold the traditional understanding of the ideology/ontology distinction in light of ideological realism. I then argue against the doctrine that certain disputes about composition have the epistemic consequence of providing no grounds for us to believe in one theory over another.In chapter 3 I argue that truthmakers do not necessitate the truths they make true. They either grounds their truths or make true their truths and nothing else can be said about the connection between truth and reality. It is to be taken as primitive that truthmakers make true the truths they make true.In chapter 4 I explore two versions of truthmaking as a theory of fundamentality. I argue against the first and defend the second against various objections and problems. I argue that if we adopt truthmaking as a theory of fundamentality, then we should believe in the second version."
it_etd_70,Image-Enabled Discourse: Investigating the Creation of Visual Information as Communicative Practice,Information Science and Technology,"Image-Enabled Communication, Multimodal Discourse, Social Interaction, Visualization, Visual Studies","Anyone who has clarified a thought or prompted a response during a conversation by drawing a picture has exploited the potential of image making as an interactive tool for conveying information. Images are increasingly ubiquitous in daily communication, in large part due to advances in visually enabled information and communication technologies (ICT), such as information visualization applications, image retrieval systems and visually enabled collaborative work tools. Human abilities to use images to communicate are however far more sophisticated and nuanced than these technologies currently support. In order to learn more about the practice of image making as a specialized form of information and communication behavior, this study examined face-to-face conversations involving the creation of ad hoc visualizations (i.e., ""napkin drawings""). A model of image-enabled discourse is introduced, which positions image making as a specialized form of communicative practice. Multimodal analysis of video-recorded conversations focused on identifying image-enabled communicative activities in terms of interactional sociolinguistic concepts of conversational involvement and coordination, specifically framing, footing and stance. The study shows that when drawing occurs in the context of an ongoing dialogue, the activity of visual representation performs key communicative tasks. Visualization is a form of social interaction that contributes to the maintenance of conversational involvement in ways that are not often evident in the image artifact. For example, drawing enables us to coordinate with each other, to introduce alternative perspectives into a conversation and even to temporarily suspend the primary thread of a discussion in order to explore a tangential thought. The study compares attributes of the image artifact with those of the activity of image making, described as a series of contrasting affordances. Visual information in complex systems is generally represented and managed based on the affordances of the artifact, neglecting to account for all that is communicated through the situated action of creating. These finding have heuristic and best-practice implications for a range of areas related to the design and evaluation of virtual collaboration environments, visual information extraction and retrieval systems, and data visualization tools."

METHODS: Twenty-two recreationally active males and females participated in this randomized, cross-over design study (age: 21.2 ± 0.6 years; BMI: 22.6 ± 0.6 kg/m2). Subjects ingested 75 g of fructose for 14 days during a period of high physical activity (FR+Active) (>12,500 steps/day) and a period of low physical activity (FR+Inactive) (<4500 steps/day). Prior to and following the 2 wk loading period, a fructose-rich meal challenge was administered (45% carbohydrate [25% fructose], 40% fat, and 15% protein). Blood was sampled at baseline and for 6 h after the meal and analyzed for triglycerides (TG), very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), c- peptide, glucose and insulin concentrations. Area under the curve (AUC) and absolute change from peak to baseline concentrations (? peak) were calculated to quantify the postprandial responses. RESULTS: TG, VLDL and IL-6 significantly increased in response to the FR+Inactive intervention (p<0.05), while GIP, insulin, c-peptide and GLP-1 (males only) significantly decreased in response to the FR+Active intervention (p<0.05). No changes occurred with glucose, TNF-a and CRP concentrations for either intervention (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: When an inactive lifestyle is adopted for two weeks, while consuming a high fructose diet, postprandial lipidemia and low grade inflammation occurs. In contrast, two weeks of increased physical activity induces positive changes in hormones associated with glucose control in order to attenuate the deleterious effects of the fructose-rich diet."
etd_741,Impact: The Supreme Court in American Politics,Political Science,"judicial impact, judicial power, policy change, Supreme Court","In this dissertation I seek to answer the question: when, how, and under what conditions does the Supreme Court make or influence policy and politics in the United States? In working to answer this question, I demonstrate that the Supreme Court has significantly more power and influence than scholars have typically given it credit for. I argue that the nature of the Court’s power is interpretive: it is the power to say what the law is. This power gives the Court the ability to make policy routinely, in every case that comes before it. Often the exercise of this policymaking power is mundane, but sometimes it is profound. By shifting focus away from compliance—the dominant focus in the empirical literature on Court power—and towards interpretation, I significantly extend the range of cases and the scope of outcomes of decisions covered by the theory of power. Finally, this theory of power allows me to develop a theory of judicial impact. I contend that judicial impact has two key sources: judicial power, and indirect judicial influence, by which I mean any action which is attributable to an exercise of judicial power, but which is not a direct outcome of any power relationship. For example, political elites respond to Court decisions, other institutions rationally anticipate Court action, and judicial decisions can incentivize or discourage activism, lobbying, legislation, litigation, and more. In short, this points to the utility of expanding the study of judicial impact to encompass all policy-relevant outcomes of judicial action, and the theory offered here provides an anchor for this approach as well as a framework for systematizing a wide range of different impacts. I go on to show that the Court’s indirect influence can be seen in that its decisions routinely affect media coverage of the issues on which it speaks, as well the policymaking agendas of the president and the political parties. In other words, I show that the Court indirectly influences policy in a number of ways, one of which is to alter the political agenda of the public and of other policymaking institutions in the United States."

SWPBS is a framework for implementing a school-wide behavior management system that focuses on proactive rather than reactive behavior interventions. SWPBS was recommended in No Child Left Behind and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act as a positive alternative to punitive discipline policies and strategies and as a tool for reducing office discipline referrals and suspensions, as well as improving academic achievement.Using in-depth interviews, participant observation, and policy analysis, I investigate the factors that influence an urban elementary school's ability to implement SWPBS, and how factors related to school-based reforms mandated by No Child Left Behind affect an underfunded urban school, serving mostly students of color, as it implements SWPBS. In addition I examine how schools, administrators and teachers negotiate expectations for fidelity of implementation, which is seen as central to successful SWPBS, given the local conditions and the day-to-day realities of one urban school. Although the focus of the study is the implementation of SWPBS in an urban school, the research is cut short when the school closes for poor academic performance and budgetary reasons. The study concludes with an analysis of the school closure due to neoliberal education reform."
etd_187,Implementation of The Essential Elements of Standards-Focused Middle-Level Schools and Programs and Their Relationship to Student Achievement,Teaching and Leadership,"Achievement, Education, Level, Middle, Student","In New York State, there are regulations that describe many of the practices that middle-level schools are supposed to implement. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of these middle-level practices in schools in the state. Without definitive information about the impact of middle-level practices on student achievement, it's difficult for practitioners and leaders to know if the school improvement decisions they make are the right ones and whether they will have the desired impact on student achievement.This study compares the implementation of the middle-level guidelines for New York State, known as The Essential Elements of Standards-Focused Middle-Level Schools and Programs, with the student achievement in these schools. Survey data were collected from 185 middle-level schools about their level of implementation of these Essential Elements. After controlling for economic disadvantage, the data about implementation in these schools was compared to the student achievement as measured by the New York State testing program.Based on the data, it is apparent that implementation of the Essential Elements is incomplete. A correlation was identified, however, that suggests that the degree of implementation of the Essential Elements does have a statistically significant impact on student achievement. Consequently, middle-level schools should work to implement the Essential Elements with greater attention and fidelity."

However, the high monomer concentration, viscosity, and exothermal temperature are considered a major limitation to the use of this material. Modified two-solution cements containing cross-linked polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanospheres (?-TSBC), as part of the polymer phase, were fabricated as the first step for optimization of cement viscosity for application of the material in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures using vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP). The ?-TSBC exhibited reduced viscosity, lower polymerization exotherm, and residual monomer in comparison to STSBC. Nevertheless, the ?-TSBC lacks bioactivity and has no biologic potential to remodel or integrate into the surrounding bone. Also, addition of radiopacifiers such as barium sulfate and zirconium dioxide is required for fluoroscopy guided procedures and is known to be detrimental to the cement mechanical and bioactive properties. In this sense, ?-TSBCs containing strontium-substituted hydroxyapatite (SrHA) microspheres have been developed in this study as a step towards improving bioactivity of these cement formulations. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a natural bone mineral component and strontium is known to stimulate bone formation and acts as a good contrast agent. In addition to this, recent studies (1-4) have shown that the antibacterial property of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles improved after partial or complete substitution of calcium with strontium ions. Thegoal of addition of SrHA microspheres into the ?-TSBC formulation is to improve bioactivity by allowing apatite formation on the cement surface that would in turn help making chemical bonds with the HA in the surrounding bone, and also to impart radiopacity and antibacterial properties without the need to incorporate any additional radio contrast or antibiotic filler material. The addition of SrHA microspheres at different concentrations resulted in improving the apatite forming ability of ?-TSBCs. The antibacterial properties of ?-TSBC containing SrHA microspheres were investigated in vitro by culturing Escherichia coli (E.coli) K12/pRSH103 biofilm which resulted in reduced biofilm growth on the cement surfaces with increasing SrHA concentration, indicating capability of bacterial inhibition. The addition of SrHA microspheres resulted in a reduction of mechanical properties in comparison to ?-TSBC, bringing these values closer to the human cancellous bone. However, the mechanical properties were similar to the ?- TSBC containing 20% wt/vol ZrO2 as a radiopacifier, indicating no further detrimental effect of the SrHA addition on the ?-TSBC properties while replacing ZrO2 in order to impart radiopacity and improve bioactivity. These cements were observed to require further optimization to improve interfacial bonding of the SrHA microspheres to the cement matrix for enhancement of mechanical properties of the material. In summary, ?-TSBCs containing SrHA microspheres were developed exhibiting a combination of attractive properties and potential for additional modification that will prolong the life and performance of arthroplasties and vertebral augmentation."
etd_740,"Improving distribution and absorption of light in microalgal photobioreactors through plasmon enhancement, entrapped cultivation and controlled motion",Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"Microalgae represent a promising source of renewable biomass for the production of biofuels and valuable chemicals. However, the development of high throughput microalgal cultivation methods and energy efficient biomass harvesting technology is necessary to improve the economic viability of large scale microalgal biomass production.The issue of poor distribution and absorption of light is one of the hurdle that can be addressed to improve the productivity in microalgal cultivation systems. As it happens, microalgal photosynthetic activities have shown great dependence on the irradiance to which the microalgal cells are exposed. Quantitatively, microalgal growth increases with increasing light intensity until a saturation level beyond which the microalgal photosynthetic machinery can be subject to photodamage. Qualitatively, most microalgal species have exhibited a propensity for wavelengths in the blue and red regions of the visible electromagnetic spectrum whereas other wavelengths can induce photoinhibition. Further, a change in the incident light can lead to photoacclimation where the microalgal species activate the preferential synthesis of certain compounds or completely alter their metabolic activity.Despite such importance of light for microalgal growth and biomass production, only a small fraction of microalgal cells receives an optimal irradiance in current microalgal cultivation systems (open and enclosed ponds). The remaining microalgal cells are found either in the over illuminated zones (e.g. top surface of open culture) of the cultivation systems where they are exposed to photoinhibition or in the poorly illuminated zones where their growth is limited. In this dissertation, this issue is addressed by developing a multi-fold approach to improve the distribution and absorption of light in microalgal photobioreactors.First, a plasmonic film light filter technology is developed. By virtue of enhancing the irradiation of blue and red lights using silver nanospheres and gold nanorods, this technology can enhance microalgal biomass production by up to 50% and increase photosynthetic pigments production by up to 78%. A short light path capable Tris-Acetate-Phosphate-Pluronic (TAPP) microalgal cultivation and harvesting system is also developed. Adding to the interesting light manipulation features, this energy efficient microalgal cultivation and harvesting system that exploits the thermoreversible sol-gel transition properties of the copolymer pluronic can increase the harvesting rate of microalgal biomass via gravimetric sedimentation by a factor of ten. Further, the adhesion properties of microalgal cells on the surface of photobioreactors are studied as a way to control the impacts of biofouling on light penetration and light absorption in microalgal cultivation systems. Furthermore, the rheological properties of microalga C. reinhardtii broths are studied and the interesting properties of such complex fluids are used as tools to control the periodical motion of microalgal cells from dark sections to well illuminated sections of typical photobioreactors for enhanced microalgal growth."
etd_604,Improving the Efficiency of Energy Harvesting Embedded System,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"In the past decade, mobile embedded systems, such as cell phones and tablets have infiltrated and dramatically transformed our life. The computation power, storage capacity and data communication speed of mobile devices have increases tremendously, and they have been used for more critical applications with intensive computation/communication. As a result, the battery lifetime becomes increasingly important and tends to be one of the key considerations for the consumers. Researches have been carried out to improve the efficiency of the lithium ion battery, which is a specific member in the more general Electrical Energy Storage (EES) family and is widely used in mobile systems, as well as the efficiency of other electrical energy storage systems such as supercapacitor, lead acid battery, and nickel–hydrogen battery etc. Previous studies show that hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES), which is a mixture of different EES technologies, gives the best performance. On the other hand, the Energy Harvesting (EH) technique has the potential to solve the problem once and for all by providing green and semi-permanent supply of energy to the embedded systems. However, the harvesting power must submit to the uncertainty of the environment and the variation of the weather. A stable and consistent power supply cannot always be guaranteed. The limited lifetime of the EES system and the unstableness of the EH system can be overcome by combining these two together to an energy harvesting embedded system and making them work cooperatively.In an energy harvesting embedded systems, if the harvested power is sufficient for the workload, extra power can be stored in the EES element; if the harvested power is short, the energy stored in the EES bank can be used to support the load demand. How much energy can be stored in the charging phase and how long the EES bank lifetime will be are affected by many factors including the efficiency of the energy harvesting module, the input/output voltage of the DC-DC converters, the status of the EES elements, and the characteristics of the workload.In this thesis, when the harvesting energy is abundant, our goal is to store as much surplus energy as possible in the EES bank under the variation of the harvesting power and the workload power. We investigate the impact of workload scheduling and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) of the embedded system on the energy efficiency of the EES bank in the charging phase. We propose a fast heuristic algorithm to minimize the energy overhead on the DC-DC converter while satisfying the timing constraints of the embedded workload and maximizing the energy stored in the HEES system. The proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of charging and discharging in an energy harvesting embedded system.On the other hand, when the harvesting rate is low, workload power consumption is supplied by the EES bank. In this case, we try to minimize the energy consumption on the embedded system to extend its EES bank life. In this thesis, we consider the scenario when workload has uncertainties and is running on a heterogeneous multi-core system. The workload variation is represented by the selection of conditional branches which activate or deactivate a set of instructions belonging to a task. We employ both task scheduling and DVFS techniques for energy optimization. Our scheduling algorithm considers the statistical information of the workload to minimize the mean power consumption of the application while satisfying a hard deadline constraint. The proposed DVFS algorithm has pseudo linear complexity and achieves comparable energy reduction as the solutions found by mathematical programming. Due to its capability of slack reclaiming, our DVFS technique is less sensitive to small change in hardware or workload and works more robustly than other techniques without slack reclaiming."
etd_456,In Defense of Deprivationism,Philosophy,"categorical desires, death, deprivation, Epicureanism, ethics, normative ethics","Death generally seems bad for those who have died. Is it? If so, what makes it bad? In this dissertation, I defend a deprivation view of the badness of death, according to which one’s death is bad for her when (and because) it deprives her of good life she would have had were her actual death not to occur. In the first two chapters of the dissertation, I show that deprivationism's main competitors (i.e. Epicureanism and Categorical Desire Views respectively) are untenable. In chapters three and four, I show how deprivationism can be made immune to the problems often regarded as devastating for the view. In the final chapter, I turn from questions about the badness of one’s own future non-existence to related questions about the badness of the future non-existence of all human life. After discussing some new philosophical issues raised by Samuel Scheffler in his Death and the Afterlife, I address those issues from the perspective of a deprivationist. In this brief introduction, I outline the central elements of each chapter.Chapter 1:Perhaps death’s badness is an illusion. Epicureans think so and argue that agents cannot be harmed by death when they're alive (because death hasn’t happened yet) nor when they're dead (because they do not exist by the time death comes). In the first chapter, I argue that each version of Epicureanism faces a fatal dilemma: it is either committed to a demonstrably false view about the relationship between prudential reasons and well-being or it is involved in a mere verbal dispute with deprivationism. I first provide principled reason to think that any viable view about the badness of death must allow that agents have prudential reason to avoid (or seek) death if doing so would increase their total well-being. I then show that the Epicurean views which accommodate this desideratum are involved in a mere verbal dispute with deprivationism. After that, I show that Epicurean views which do not preserve this link are subject to reductio arguments and so should be rejected.Chapter 2:In the second chapter, I argue that categorical desire views of the badness of death are false. Such views hold that death is bad when (and because) it thwarts people’s categorical desires, which are self-regarding desires that are not conditional upon being alive. I show that categorical desire views are subject to two serious problems. First, they entail that it is not bad for someone to not be resuscitated after dying a bad death. Second, they cannot account for cases in which it is good to prevent people from coming into existence or cases in which it is good to prevent them from continuing to exist. I then argue that revising categorical desire views to avoid these problems requires adopting a form of deprivationism.Chapter 3:Even once the alternatives to deprivationism have been ruled out, a number of interesting questions remain. If earlier-than-necessary death is bad because it deprives individuals of additional good life, then why isn’t later-than-necessary conception bad for the same reason? Deprivationists have traditionally argued that conception is not bad because it is impossible to be conceived earlier, but death is bad because it is possible to die later. In the third chapter, I demonstrate that this proposed solution does not work by showing how it is possible to be conceived earlier in the same relevant senses it is possible to die later. I then offer a new solution to this asymmetry problem by separating the potential badness of each type of event (i.e. conception and death) from the degree to which these events should be salient. Even if both types of events are equally bad, certain contingent facts about our death give us reason to, in a way, be more concerned with our earlier-than-necessary deaths more than our later-than-necessary conceptions.Chapter 4:In the fourth chapter, I show that deprivation accounts cannot accommodate the commonsense assumption that an agent should lament her death if and only if it is bad for her. Call this the Nothing Bad, Nothing to Lament Assumption (NBNL). To illustrate the problem, imagine that a healthy, happy person is struck and killed by a car today. Suppose that if she did not die from being hit by the car, she would have died from an aneurysm one millisecond later. Assume that the millisecond of extra life would not have contributed to her total well-being. According to deprivationism, this person’s death was not bad for her because she would not have had a better life if she did not die when she did. Furthermore, if NBNL is true, then this person’s death is not even lamentable. So, deprivationism coupled with NBNL leads to absurd conclusions. This means that we must either reject deprivation accounts of the badness of death or reject NBNL. I show that a commitment to an incontrovertible moral principle entails that, contrary to commonsense, we should reject NBNL.If death isn’t necessarily lamentable when it’s bad for us, then when (if ever) is it lamentable? In the second part of the fourth chapter, I develop a positive account of appropriate attitudes toward death. Specifically, I argue that each person should have two distinct attitudes toward death. The first kind of appropriate attitude is determined by how well an agent P fares relative to her subjectively justified beliefs about her expected quality and quantity of life. The worse P fares relative to her subjectively justified beliefs, the more she should, in one sense, lament her death and vice versa. The second kind of appropriate attitude is determined by the amount of good P was subjectively justified in believing was metaphysically possible for her to have obtained had P not died when she did. The more metaphysically possible good that death precludes, the more P’s death is, in one sense, lamentable.Chapter 5:In his Death and the Afterlife, Samuel Scheffler provides a compelling argument that people would see less reason and be significantly less motivated to pursue most of their life’s projects if they were to discover that there is no collective afterlife (i.e. future generations of humans continuing to exist after they die). Although Scheffler focuses on how people would react to learning there is no collective afterlife, people’s imagined responses are presumed to be, for the most part, appropriate. In this chapter, I focus on issues concerning how people ought to react to learning there is no collective afterlife. Answers to this question leads to surprising conclusions that challenge some of the normative claims Scheffler seems disposed to endorse.This paper has two central aims. First, I attempt to show that negative attitudes toward the lack of a collective afterlife are warranted for two reasons that have been heretofore overlooked. Interestingly, such reasons leave open the possibility that it can be appropriate to lament the lack of a collective afterlife even if is not bad, all things considered, for anyone. Second, I argue that the lack of a collective afterlife need not be bad, all things considered, for most people. This is because there could be a sufficient number of meaningful projects available to people that would compensate for the loss of pro tanto value caused by the lack of a collective afterlife. These considerations lead us to the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that the lack of a collective afterlife need not negatively affect the total value of anyone’s life, yet it may still be appropriate to lament the fact that there is no collective afterlife."
etd_22,"In Search of a Single Voice: The Politics of Form, Use and Belief in the Kernewek Language",Anthropology,"Celtic, Cornish, Cornwall, Language Ideology, Revival, Standardization","This dissertation is based upon fieldwork performed between 2007 and 2011 in Cornwall, a region of Southwestern Britain notable for its ambiguous ethnic identity - caught between England and the Celtic nations - and its unique, revived Celtic language, Kernewek. During the course of the research, work focused upon the role of the language revival movement as a tool for ethnic identification: hardening boundaries, shoring up faltering communities and nationalist purification. However, the language movement is divided into three primary factions, which take differing approaches to the language, and to their corresponding language ideology based upon their relationship to Cornish identity. These relationships are based upon speakers' sense of ethnic self as formed through class, kinship, linguistic self-perception, religious and political affiliations and place of birth and childhood. However, since the 2006 recognition of the language by the British states, all of these debates have become intensified due to pressure to standardize. This study examines specific examples including: teaching materials and pedagogical approaches in the language, debates over the minutiae of spelling, aesthetic sensibilities, and practices of the naming and renaming of people and places."
etd_292,In Search of Ordenamiento Ambiental Territorial in the Peasant Reserve Zones of Colombia,Geography,"campesinos, Colombia, Ordenamiento Ambiental Territorial, Ordenamiento Territorial, peasants, Zonas de Reserva Campesina","This thesis is an intersection between political ecology, rural development and agrarian studies. It examines the Peasant Reserve Zone (ZRC) as a land planning designation in Colombia created in the 1990s as part of the Colombian state’s effort at agrarian reform, and the expressions of Ordenamiento Ambiental Territorial (glossed as environmental land use planning), by the state and the peasants as ways of constructing territory. Beginning by situating the emergence of the ZRC as part of the classic agrarian question of the fate of the peasantry in capitalism, it then intersects that political-economy perspective with a geographic approach to the concept of territory.  The establishment of the political technology of Ordenamiento Territorial and its environmental version, Ordenamiento Ambiental Territorial are analyzed together with the arrival of neoliberalism in the 1990s in Colombia. Using a political ecology lens, Ordenamiento Ambiental Territorial is dissected by searching the current meaning of environment from its roots in the meanings of nature and particularly with the production of nature under capitalism. Finally, through three perspectives on development, this thesis analyzes diverse forms of development planning in the ZRC (Sustainable Development Plans of each ZRC, results of the ZRC pilot project financed by the World Bank, and fieldwork results) to examine cross-cutting issues of environmental governance in the ZRC including participation, expectations and imaginaries of the state, the ZRC and “the peasant community”. The main message of this work is that ZRC peasants are not only claiming land rights but are demanding a recognition of territory through their engagements with Ordenamiento Territorial, their uses of Ordenamiento Ambiental Territorial and their participation in development planning."
etd_424,Incompatibilist Alternative Possibilities,Philosophy,"Determinism, Free Will, Manipulation, Molinism, Moral Responsibility, Principle of Alternative Possibilities","This dissertation has two primary aims. The first aim is to defend the position that the alternative possibilities that are required for basic desert moral responsibility are incompatible with causal determinism. The second aim is to investigate such incompatibilist alternative possibilities, specifically in relation to manipulation, deliberation, and Molinist counterfactuals of freedom.In chapter 1, “Fischer’s Deterministic Frankfurt-Style Argument”, I examine John Martin Fischer’s deterministic Frankfurt-style argument against the principle of alternative possibilities (PAP). Fischer attempts to show that if causal determinism rules out an agent’s moral responsibility, it is not in virtue of its eliminating the agent’s alternative possibilities. I contend that, once we focus upon the distinction between entailment and explanation, the incompatibilist defender of PAP can successfully rebut Fischer’s argument. I argue for this claim while granting Fischer a number of assumptions that only render a defense of PAP more difficult. Additionally, I cast doubt upon David Palmer’s critique of Fischer’s argument, which in turn renders my defense of PAP all the more critical.In chapter 2, “Leeway Compatibilism and Frankfurt-Style Cases”, I examine the new dispositionalists’ defense of the position that an agent in a deterministic Frankfurt-style case (FSC) has the ability to do otherwise, where that ability is the one at issue in PAP. Focusing specifically on Kadri Vihvelin’s proposal, I argue against this position by showing that it is incompatible with the existence of structurally similar cases to FSCs in which a preemptive intervener bestows an agent with an ability.In chapter 3, “The Manipulation Argument, At the Very Least, Undermines Classical Compatibilism”, I argue precisely what the title suggests. More specifically, I argue that classical compatibilism, in conjunction with any type of reply to the manipulation argument, has counterintuitive implications. In order to avoid such implications, we need not hold that determinism is incompatible with moral responsibility. But we must hold that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise.In chapter 4, “Manipulating Deliberators”, I offer a counterexample to Derk Pereboom’s account of rational deliberation, and then employ it to develop a four-case manipulated deliberation argument against deliberation compatibilism, the view that rational deliberation is compatible with the belief that one’s actions are causally determined by factors beyond one’s control. Given the structural similarity between my argument and Pereboom’s four-case manipulation argument against compatibilism, both arguments stand or fall to together. As a result, a hard incompatibilist such as Pereboom faces a dilemma: either give up deliberation compatibilism, as well as the view that one can (as a hard incompatibilist) rationally deliberate, or give up the four-case manipulation argument.In chapter 5, “Counterfactuals of Divine Freedom”, I argue that, contrary to the commonly held position of Luis de Molina, Thomas Flint and others, counterfactuals of divine freedom (CDFs) are pre-volitional for God within the Molinist framework. That is, CDFs are not true even partly in virtue of some act of God’s will. As a result, I argue that the Molinist God fails to satisfy an epistemic openness requirement for rational deliberation, and thus cannot rationally deliberate about which world to actualize.In chapter 6, “Molinists (Still) Cannot Endorse the Consequence Argument”, I defend Ken Perszyk’s argument for the claim that Molinists cannot consistently endorse the consequence argument because of a structurally similar argument for the incompatibility of true Molinist counterfactuals of freedom (CCFs) and the ability to do otherwise. More specifically, Edward Wierenga has argued that on the proper understanding of CCFs, there is a relevant difference between the consequence argument and the anti-Molinist argument. I argue that, even on Wierenga’s understanding of CCFs, there is in fact no relevant difference between the two arguments. Moreover, I strengthen Perszyk’s argument by highlighting further relevant similarities between CCFs and facts about the laws of nature."

More specifically, this research examines whether or not The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal used any news frames promoted by The White House regarding the former NSA contactor Edward Snowden and his whistleblowing attempts.  Results of the textual analysis of The White House Statements and selected opinion pieces indicate that indexing did not occur and a variety of opinion took place.  Listed results fall in the theoretical realm of the indexing hypothesis. The study demonstrated that opinion journalism serves an important role in facilitating debates around salient issues and informing the public about those debates."

More and more novel technology has been used on a variety of sensors. This thesis investigates using semiconductor cylinder fiber as a new kind of fiber sensor.Our main motive to do this research is based on my interest in optical fiber. After I did some experiments on the semiconductor cylinder fiber, I found some interesting characteristics. When we changed some environmental conditions around the fiber, the output light from it would change accordingly. So I did a systematic research on it.This project uses In2Te3 as a coating layer between the glass core and glass cladding boundary. The layer is a few microns thick and deposited in vacuum. The fiber is industry-standard 125 µm in dimension and with ±5 µm tolerance. Some experiments have been conducted on a 2.5 inches long semiconductor cylinder fiber. As the surrounding temperature changes, the light output would change linearly in log scale. And different magnetic fields also change the light output. These characteristics provide a good potential for the fiber to function as a fiber sensor.Another experiment was conducted to see if there was an amplification or laser effect on this kind of fiber. Wide-spectrum light pumps were used to shine light on the side of this piece of fiber, and so far no obvious amplification was observed."
etd_415,INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (IEQ) AND BUILDING ENERGY OPTIMIZATION THROUGH MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC),Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,,"This dissertation aims at developing a novel and systematic approach to apply Model Predictive Control (MPC) to improve energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality in office buildings. Model predictive control is one of the advanced optimal control approaches that use models to predict the behavior of the process beyond the current time to optimize the system operation at the present time. In building system, MPC helps to exploit buildings’ thermal storage capacity and to use the information on future disturbances like weather and internal heat gains to estimate optimal control inputs ahead of time.In this research the major challenges of applying MPC to building systems are addressed. A systematic framework has been developed for ease of implementation. New methods are proposed to develop simple and yet reasonably accurate models that can minimize the MPC development effort as well as computational time.The developed MPC is used to control a detailed building model represented by whole building performance simulation tool, EnergyPlus. A co-simulation strategy is used to communicate the MPC control developed in Matlab platform with the case building model in EnergyPlus. The co-simulation tool used (MLE+) also has the ability to talk to actual building management systems that support the BACnet communication protocol which makes it easy to implement the developed MPC control in actual buildings.A building that features an integrated lighting and window control and HVAC system with a dedicated outdoor air system and ceiling radiant panels was used as a case building. Though this study is specifically focused on the case building, the framework developed can be applied to any building type.The performance of the developed MPC was compared against a baseline control strategy using Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) control. Various conventional and advanced thermal comfort as well as ventilation strategies were considered for the comparison. These include thermal comfort control based on ASHRAE comfort zone (based on temperature and relative humidity) and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and ventilation control based on ASHRAE 62.1 and Demand Control Ventilation (DCV). The building energy consumption was also evaluated with and without integrated lighting and window blind control. The simulation results revealed better performance of MPC both in terms of energy savings as well as maintaining acceptable indoor environmental quality. Energy saving as high as 48% was possible using MPC with integrated lighting and window blind control.A new critical contaminant - based demand control ventilation strategy was also developed to ensure acceptable or higher indoor air quality. Common indoor and outdoor contaminants were considered in the study and the method resulted in superior performance especially for buildings with strong indoor or outdoor contaminant sources compared to conventional CO2 - based demand control ventilation which only monitors CO2 to vary the minimum outdoor air ventilation rate."

This study examined the role of two parental emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) on parental inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior. I tested the hypotheses that parental cognitive reappraisal positively correlates with inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior whereas parental expressive suppression negatively correlates with inductive discipline in a sample of 59 parents of 3-to-5 year old children. I performed correlation and regression analyses to examine these relationships. Results indicated that expressive suppression was negatively associated with children’s prosocial behavior. In addition, the relationship between inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior was stronger when parental warmth was high. These findings provide empirical evidence for the influence of parental emotion regulation strategies on parenting behaviors and child outcome."

However, the interpretation of pedogenic carbonate T(?47) data is limited by uncertainties in our understanding of carbonate formation processes. This study examines the potential for along-strike, same elevation and plant biomass (C3/C4) site variability to influence pedogenic carbonate T(?47) data. Pedogenic carbonates were collected from five modern soil pits in the semi-arid eastern Andean piedmont of Argentina under a summer precipitation regime. Three of the five soil pits were instrumented with soil temperature and soil moisture sensors to a depth of 1 m (at 1 km elevation), while a fourth was instrumented with an additional soil CO2 sensor and atmospheric sensors (temperature, relative humidity, insolation and rainfall) (at 0.6 km elevation). T(?47) values are statistically indistinguishable between the four instrumented sites and are invariant with depth. The mean T(?47) is 31°C ± 4°C (± 1SE), reflecting summer soil temperatures. Soil moisture and temperature data indicate that isothermal conditions are achieved immediately after significant wetting events. Carbonate formation under these conditions could result in our observed hot isothermal T(?47) values. The results of this study constrain carbonate formation to the early part of soil drying, with T(?47) interpretations biased to soil conditions just after major precipitation events."
mar_etd_3,Influences of Product Concept Demonstrations in Trade Shows: Two Essays,Marketing,"Event study, Firm value, Inter-temporal, Pricing, Product concept demonstration, Product differentiation","I study the effects of product concept demonstrations on firm value and on firms' profit using two different methods: empirical and analytical approaches.Utilizing an event study, in Essay 1, I assess the effects of product concept demonstrations in trade shows on abnormal stock returns and risks. My investigation has two interconnected parts: (1) analysis of the firms' decision on how many concepts to demonstrate and what would be the concept mix; and (2) analysis of investor reactions to the demonstration that influence the firm value and risk. I find that the number of concept demonstrations are influenced by the innovativeness of the concept mix, the demonstrating firms' past conversion history of concepts to commercialization, and the total number of concepts demonstrations, reflecting the size of the trade show. As a result, the concepts demonstrations for the first-time positively influence cumulative abnormal return, but the effects of demonstrating previously demonstrated concepts are negative.In Essay 2, I develop a two-period game-theoretic model to analyze the intertemporal strategic interactions in a firms' pricing strategy for the old and new models with a product concept demonstration. My analysis provides new insights into the interplay of product positioning and a product concept demonstration that induces varying degrees of purchase delay while shaping the firms' dynamic pricing strategy. As a result, I find that a product concept demonstration can lower the new model price even below what it would be without a demonstration; further, I find that the volume of delayed purchases induced by a product concept demonstration is the greatest at very low or very high levels of product substitutability, exhibiting a U-shaped pattern. My findings suggest that differentiating the new model either horizontally or vertically is a critical factor for profitable pre-launch product concept demonstration. However, the mechanisms that lead to concept demonstration profitability are quite different between the two types of differentiation. Allowing various scenarios of product line and pricing policies, I find that the simpler pricing policy can dominate more complex pricing strategies.Overall, the influences of the product concept demonstrations are researched through both empirical and analytical methods. The results of this dissertation suggest that innovative product concept demonstration generates positive firm value in the short run. Product concept demonstration also creates greater profit when the new product concept is either horizontally or vertically differentiated."
scied_etd_23,Influences to Post-graduation Career Aspirations and Attainment in STEM Doctoral Candidates and Recipients,Science Teaching,"Career Aspirations, Career Attianment, Doctoral Recipients, Socialization, STEM","As the realities of the academic job market have forced some PhD recipients to accept less-preferable position types, there has been increasing concerns that these students are not prepared for their careers, especially in STEM fields. However, aside from the labor market, few studies have explored the influences on career aspiration and attainment among doctoral degree holders. This study utilized the socialization theory framework to identify aspects of the doctoral education process that are predictive of the likelihood of certain career aspirations among science and engineering doctoral candidates and career attainment among STEM doctoral recipients by utilizing nationally representative datasets: The National Research Council's Assessment of Research Doctorate Programs student questionnaire and the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates. This study identified field of study, research productivity rank of doctoral programs, primary type of finding doctoral students received, level of satisfaction with research experiences, and their sense of belonging within their doctoral program as factors that predict the likelihood of certain career aspirations compared with a career in education. Doctoral candidates' background characteristics that were significant predictors of career aspirations were gender, marital status, dependent status, race, age, and citizenship status. Further, this study identified participant's field of study, the Carnegie Rank of institutions attended, primary type of funding received, length of time to PhD, gender, marital status, dependent status, race, citizenship stats, and age as factors that predict the likelihood of the career outcomes investigated in this study, including doctoral recipients' employment field and primary work activity."
etd_534,"INNOVATIVE AND CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO DETRITAL ZIRCON PROVENANCE ANALYSIS: LOOKING TO THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE",Earth Sciences,"Detrital, Geochronology, Multidimensional Scaling, Provenance, Tibetan Plateau, Zircon","Detrital provenance analysis is an important tool in our understanding paleo-fluvial drainages, erosion of landscapes, paleogeographic reconstructions, and regional geologic and tectonic histories. Here, we examine the utility of multiple provenance analysis techniques through their application to paleo, modern, and synthetic detrital datasets. Zircon is a common accessory mineral found in most detrital sediments, primarily due to its refractory nature. During formation, zircon preferentially incorporates the element U and Th into its crystal lattice while excluding Pb, making it ideal for radiometric dating. Inexpensive and time-efficient U/Pb age acquisition techniques make zircon the mineral of choice for a majority of provenance studies.The sedimentary basins between the Yangtze River and Red River have long been used to argue for a Mississippi River-scale paleo-drainage. We examine the U/Pb zircon ages of Cenozoic deposits ranging from Eocene to Pliocene age from basins surrounding the first bend of the Yangtze River and upper reaches of the Red River. We combine this data with a comprehensive suite of zircon grain-ages from contemporaneous deposits, modern fluvial sediments, and bedrock source units from previously published literature. Using the new technique developed here, of combining age spectra deconvolution and age component interpolation maps, it becomes clear that Cenozoic deposits of the Southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau do not share provenance with offshore sediments associated with the Paleo Red River in the Yinggehai Song-Hong Basin. This, coupled with detailed stratigraphic measurements and interpretations, as well as paleoflow measurements strongly suggests that at least since the Eocene, there was no connectivity between the Yangtze and Red Rivers.In a modern setting, examination of provenance of fluvial sediments collected throughout a known catchment can provide insight into regional erosional patterns. The modern Yangtze River, the largest river in Eurasia, provides a perfect setting to apply detrital zircon provenance analysis. We use a previously published zircon U/Pb age distribution dataset of fifteen trunk stream samples and ten samples of the largest tributaries feeding the Yangtze. We apply a series of age-distribution analysis techniques to examine both downstream changes in provenance of trunk stream samples as well as identify the key bedrock and tributary sources of sediment to the trunk stream samples throughout the Yangtze's reach. The original work using this dataset argued that increasing anthropogenic influences, primarily agricultural, lead to a greater than expected influence of the Han, Yuan, and Xiang Rivers, whose confluence with the Yangtze occur in the middle-to lower reaches. The quantitative analysis developed here, however, shows a consistent distribution of U/Pb ages for Yangtze River trunk stream sediments is established in the upper reaches of the Yangtze after the first bend and is maintained some 3000km downstream. The signal is most likely derived from the erosion of the geologic terranes of the Songpan Ganze Terrane and the Longmenshan range, which are sourced primarily by the Yalong, Min, and Dadu rivers. These sources of sediment are consistent with known areas of greater stream power due to higher slopes, exhumation rates, and tectonic activity.One technique that has recently been applied to detrital zircon datasets is multidimensional scaling, or MDS. MDS transforms pairwise dissimilarity measurements of sample U/Pb age distributions into Euclidian distances and then some optimal configuration, where greater distances between sample points represents greater dissimilarity between their respective age distributions. While MDS is not new, its application to detrital zircon datasets has never been rigorously tested. We examine several important issues in the application of MDS to detrital zircon research, including how intra-sample variation is represented as well as how dissimilarities are calculated; how random sampling associated with dating a limited number of zircon grain ages can and does affect the resulting MDS configuration; and how MDS differentiation is affected by samples containing either varying degrees of overlapping, shared, or unique age components. In application of MDS to both synthetic and real-world datasets, we illustrate the usefulness of the approach in the interpretation of detrital zircon age data; which suggests that thoughtful application of MDS mapping to detrital zircon data can afford significant advantages in the geologic interpretation of zircon grain ages."
it_etd_85,Institutional and Individual Influences on Scientists' Data Sharing Behaviors,Library and Information Science,"Cyberinfrastructure, Data Reuse, Data Sharing, eScience, Institutional Theory, Multilevel Analysis","In modern research activities, scientific data sharing is essential, especially in terms of data-intensive science and scholarly communication. Scientific communities are making ongoing endeavors to promote scientific data sharing. Currently, however, data sharing is not always well-deployed throughout diverse science and engineering disciplines. Disciplinary traditions, organizational barriers, lack of technological infrastructure, and individual perceptions often contribute to limit scientists from sharing their data. Since scientists' data sharing practices are embedded in their respective disciplinary contexts, it is necessary to examine institutional influences as well as individual motivations on scientists' data sharing behaviors.     The objective of this research is to investigate the institutional and individual factors which influence scientists' data sharing behaviors in diverse scientific communities. Two theoretical perspectives, institutional theory and theory of planned behavior, are employed in developing a conceptual model, which shows the complementary nature of the institutional and individual factors influencing scientists' data sharing behaviors. Institutional theory can explain the context in which individual scientists are acting; whereas the theory of planned behavior can explain the underlying motivations behind scientists' data sharing behaviors in an institutional context.     This research uses a mixed-method approach by combining qualitative and quantitative methods: (1) interviews with the scientists in diverse scientific disciplines to understand the extent to which they share their data with other researchers and explore institutional and individual factors affecting their data sharing behaviors; and (2) survey research to examine to what extent those institutional and individual factors influence scientists' data sharing behaviors in diverse scientific disciplines.     The interview study with 25 scientists shows three groups of data sharing factors, including institutional influences (i.e. regulative pressures by funding agencies and journals and normative pressure); individual motivations (i.e. perceived benefit, risk, effort and scholarly altruism); and institutional resources (i.e. metadata and data repositories). The national survey (with 1,317 scientists in 43 disciplines) shows that regulative pressure by journals; normative pressure at a discipline level; and perceived career benefit and scholarly altruism at an individual level have significant positive relationships with data sharing behaviors; and that perceived effort has a significant negative relationship. Regulative pressure by funding agencies and the availability of data repositories at a discipline level and perceived career risk at an individual level were not found to have any significant relationships with data sharing behaviors"

I highlight the centrality of literary and cultural texts, and their attendant questions of form and genre in negotiating planetary imaginaries of solidarity.

Roy and Claude McKay; post-1950s New Left conversations on urbanity in the Global North and South; cross-cultural aesthetic interactions involving indigenous South Asian prose and theatrical forms (naksha and jatra), 1960s pan-Africanist Black Power and Black Arts movements in the US, African decolonization, Latin American Third-Cinema and contemporary South Asian Anglophone fiction. I draw on a number of key representations of the Naxalites across a broad spectrum of cultural forms (novels, plays, film, satire, and autobiography), by globally-known Anglophone authors such as Aravind Adiga and Arundhati Roy, as well as relatively neglected but major cosmopolitan figures such as Utpal Dutt, Mrinal Sen and M.N. Roy. Elaborating on the interactions of the indigenous and the local with the transnational in these texts, I uncover little-known genealogies of planetary solidarity engendered by the Naxalites. My dissertation thus locates the development of Naxalism in India within broader conversations on modernity and insurgency spanning over a century, mapping an alternative history of emancipatory politics and elaborating the role of literary texts in the envisioning of collective liberation."
etd_267,Integration of EVs and DGs into the Electric Power System  for Grid Modernization,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Distributed Generator, Electric Vehicle, Frequency Regulation, Islanding, Non Detection Zone, Reactive Power Service","Electric power systems (EPSs) are rapidly becoming more complex. Penetration of distributed generators (DGs) are increasing rapidly. Among them, DG units with intermittent renewables resources, such as solar or wind, are attracting more attention. Moreover, plug in electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to be deployed in large numbers over the next decade. These changes present opportunities as well as challenges for reliable and e?cient operation of EPS.Integrating EVs in large scale, would result in over-loading of EPS. Interconnection of DGs could impact adversely on the system operation including power quality and safety of the EPS. However, due to the growing number of EVs in the system, faster charging, shorter battery reaction time, and vehicle-to-grid services, EVs could be attractive sources for system operators (SOs) to improve system reliability while creating opportunity for EV owners to gain monetary bene?ts. In addition, the potential bene?ts of DG could be sustained in avoiding or shifting investment in transmission lines and/or transformers, minimizing ohmic losses, and protecting the environment.In this dissertation, potential bene?ts and challenges of EVs and DGs are explored. For some potential bene?ts, the dissertation develops systematic frameworks, in order to facilitate integration of EVs and DGs into the EPS. Also for some challenges, the dissertation presents solutions to analyze and overcome related di?culties.To study consequences of integrating EVs, a comprehensive model of EV operation is presented. The model covers di?erent modes of operation and includes impact of battery degradation during the operation. The model is then extended to control a large group of EVs e?ciently. Several possible ancillary services which could be o?ered by EVs, including voltage and frequency regulation services, are discussed. Several systematic frameworks are developed to engage EVs in provision of ancillary services, from economical and technical view points. Simulation results clearly indicate EVs ability to participate in ancillary services and possible revenue stream for EV owners.In terms of DGs, the dissertation addresses a common issue in most of utility companies and that is the risk of unintentional islanding of interconnected DGs. A systematic procedure is presented in this dissertation which can detect any possible operating conditions leading to an unintentional islanding of DGs. The developed procedure can serve utility companies as an analytical tool for any interconnection study, in a timely and costly e?cient manner. The procedure is not dependent on the anti-islanding schemes nor DG technologies. Simulation results of di?erent real case studies prove the generality and practicality of the procedure."

The increased volume of IPC present in Android devices, coupled with intent's ability to implicitly find valid receivers for IPC, bring about new security challenges to the computing security landscape.This work proposes Intentio Ex Machina (IEM), an access control solution for Android intent IPC security. IEM separates the logic for performing access control from where the intents are intercepted by placing an interface in the Android framework. This allows the access control logic to be placed inside a normal application and reached via the interface. The app, called a “user firewall”, can then receive intents as they enter the system and inspect them. Not only can the user firewall allow or block intents, but it can even—within designed limitations—modify them. Since the user firewall runs as a normal user application, developers are free to create their own user firewall applications which users can then download and enable. In this way, IEM creates a new genre of security application for Android systems allowing for creative and interactive approaches to active IPC defense."
etd_375,Interaction effects between the DRD4 VNTR and the number of heavy-drinking peers on alcohol consumption: An experimental alcohol administration study,Psychology,"alcohol consumption, DRD4 VNTR, gene-environment interaction, peers, young adults","The presence of drinking peers, particularly multiple peers, has been shown to be an influential alcohol-promoting environment for young adults.  Drinking peers may trigger genetic vulnerabilities to alcohol-promoting social environments.  Carriers of the DRD4 VNTR 7-repeat allele have been shown to be more vulnerable than noncarriers to alcohol-promoting peer environments, such as the presence of heavy-drinking peers and a college/Greek environment.  However, research has not yet examined whether there are DRD4 VNTR-related differences in alcohol consumption as a function of the number of drinking peers.  The current study aimed to examine whether carrying the 7-repeat allele exacerbates the effects of peer presence on alcohol consumption and characterize potential mediators responsible for such DRD4 VNTR-related differences.  Ninety eight Caucasian young adult moderate to heavy drinkers (mean age = 22.3 years [SD = 2.16]; 48% female) were randomly assigned to one of three groups, consuming alcohol in the presence of none, one, or three heavy-drinking peer confederates.  Results showed no significant moderating effects of the DRD4 VNTR in the relationship between the number (or presence) of heavy-drinking peers and voluntary alcohol consumption, after controlling for gender, age, and typical drinking quantity.  These results add to recent mixed findings on the moderating role of the DRD4 VNTR in the effect of perceived peer environments on young adult drinking.  Future examination into DRD4 VNTR-related susceptibility to alcohol-promoting peer environments through meta-analytic synthesis and both experimental and prospective, multi-wave designs is needed to resolve mixed findings."
etd_353,"Interactions Between Cultural Attitudes, Cultural Instruction,  and Second Language Use  by International Students at the University Level","Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics","Intercultural communication, Second language use, Study abroad","While participating in study abroad programs, language instructors and learnersalike hope that learners will have many opportunities for communicative intercultural engagement in the second language (L2). Such interactions are desirable because correlations exist between the quantity and quality of L2 interactions that learners have and the ultimate language gains that they attain while studying in a host country (e.g., Baker-Smemoe, et al., 2012; Dewey, et al., 2013; Isabelli-Garcia, 2006). In order to optimize L2 development, this study investigates learners' out-of-class L2 use, cultural attitudes, and social motivations, in addition to analyzing how these factors may be impacted by different types of cultural instruction.The data for this study are drawn from two upper-intermediate, first-year classes of English as a Second Language (ESL) at a university in the US, targeting the following: (1) free-writing exercises involving cultural knowledge and experiences, and (2) a pre- and post-intervention survey of cultural attitudes and intercultural L2 use. The intervention provided explicit cultural instruction in one class and implicit cultural instruction in the other. Quantitative and qualitative analyses focus on the ways in which explicit and implicit cultural instruction impact learners' attitudes, which may relate to the ways in which they interact in the L2, integrate into the host community, and use the L2 meaningfully for intercultural interactions outside of class.Results offer insights into the baseline cultural attitudes and social motivations of ESL learners who have recently arrived for extended study abroad experiences in the US, in addition to providing information regarding learners' patterns of L2 usage and their perspectives on intercultural communication. Statistical analyses demonstrate that while attitudes and motivations did have positive increases throughout the course of one semester, varying pedagogical interventions involving explicit or implicit methods of cultural instruction did not appear to have a significant effect. This may have implications for course design as instructors consider how to best provide cultural instruction in the second language classroom."
etd_483,Interactions between Inflammatory Cells and CoCrMo Alloy Surfaces under Simulated Inflammatory Conditions,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"CoCrMo, Corrosion, Inflammatory cell, Inflammatory condition","Metallic biomaterials continue to be the primary materials for medical devices because of their excellent physical and mechanical properties especially for certain implants which need high strength (hip, spinal, shoulder, knee etc.).  However there is no perfect material to meet all the requirements of a medical device.  Metallic biomaterials are prone to corrosion and wear which has been associated with implant failure (osteolysis, aseptic loosening, pseudo tumor etc.)  This study focused on investigating how inflammatory cells interact with CoCrMo alloy surfaces under simulated inflammatory conditions (H2O2 treatment).  It is hypothesized that the presence of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in cell culture will affect the viability of inflammatory cells and that when ROS interacts with CoCrMo alloy surfaces the effect on cell viability is increased.  The first part of the study focused on the cell behavior (viability and morphology) when cultured directly on CoCrMo alloy surfaces with different concentrations of H2O2 in the medium (0.2 mM – 1 mM) and compared with the same solution conditions but on tissue culture substrate.  The electrochemical behavior of CoCrMo alloy surfaces was also examined when exposed to inflammatory cells and inflammatory fluid (i.e. medium with H2O2 added).  The results show a narrower range of H2O2 concentration for cell viability for the CoCrMo group when compared to tissue culture substrate (p < 0.05).  This indicates that the presence of metal implants during inflammation might raise the ROS toxicity towards cells after surgery.  Inflammatory conditions (i.e. H2O2 + inflammatory cells) were also found to result in corrosion of CoCrMo alloy surfaces.  These short-term results raise significant questions about the long-term interactions between ROS, CoCrMo alloy and inflammatory cells."

In Ukraine, scientific research on intimate partner violence emerged only a few years ago and as a result has not accumulated comprehensive data on the predictors of violence. The current study aimed to address this gap by examining the relationship between economic hardship and intimate partner violence and by investigating how this relationship changes after introducing various individual, familial, and cultural predictors. The final sample included 406 female and 134 male students from different cities in Ukraine. Structural equation modeling and path analysis were applied to analyze the data. The results demonstrated that in both female and male sub-samples the relationship between economic hardship and intimate partner violence became insignificant after introducing individual and familial variables. The link between independent and dependent variables was mediated by emotional distress, alcohol use (for females only), parent-to-parent violence, and parent-to-child violence. The results also showed that there was no interaction effect between culture and economic hardship. Instead, attitudes toward intimate partner violence (in both female and male sub-samples) and perceptions of criminal justice system policies (in female sub-sample only) predicted intimate partner violence separately from economic hardship."
etd_64,Intraspecific trait variation and community assembly in old-field grasslands,Biology,"community ecology, intraspecific variation, old field, plant traits","Trait-based approaches are increasingly used in plant community ecology, but previous research has largely ignored functional trait variation within species. Here I investigated the role of intraspecific trait variation in community assembly and responses to spatial and temporal environmental variation in old-field plant communities in the eastern United States. In the first study I analyzed spatial patterns of functional divergence in old fields in central New York on spatial scales from 1-1500 m. Results showed that spatial divergence in functional traits at the community and intraspecific levels corresponded with spatial heterogeneity in edaphic variables, consistent with predicted patterns resulting from trait-based environmental filtering. In the second study I tested for evidence of environmental filtering and niche differentiation based on trait dispersion patterns, with or without accounting for intraspecific trait variation. The tests provided evidence of strong trait-based environmental filtering and weak niche differentiation, and these patterns were strengthened by the inclusion of intraspecific trait variation, demonstrating its importance for community assembly. In the third study I examined the contributions of intraspecific variation and species turnover to community trait responses to environmental gradients across a 1200-km latitudinal extent in the eastern United States. Community trait shifts in response to broad-scale climatic variation were driven primarily by species turnover, but intraspecific variation contributed strongly to trait shifts along edaphic gradients and at fine spatial scales. Finally I investigated the role of intraspecific variation in community trait responses to experimental nutrient enrichment in old-field communities and the influence of community functional diversity and dispersal in mediating these responses. After three years, community functional responses were driven almost entirely by intraspecific trait shifts, which were strongest in communities with high initial intraspecific variation for some traits. Taken together, my results suggest that intraspecific trait variation plays a strong role in the assembly of old-field plant communities and shed light on the circumstances in which intraspecific variation is likely to be important for plant community ecology in general."
etd_74,Introducing Wireless Grids Technology to the Field of Telemedicine,Information Science and Technology,"Ad Hoc Networking, Adult Learning, Healthcare, Military, Telemedicine, Wireless Grids","While telemedicine and technology-enabled education are not new concepts and have significant bodies of research, in depth application to management and treatment of veteran Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is relatively new.  The conflicts in the Southwest Asia over the last two decades have significantly increased the need for healthcare and support services for these returning warriors.  Creative thinking and innovative technologies are needed to meet the growing and changing demand of these patients in the face of many competing demands within the U.S. healthcare sector.This doctoral research study investigated the potential for a platform-agnostic (ad hoc) networking technology to serve as a trusted social networking and training platform for healthcare providers who are striving to provide quality healthcare that meets the needs of veterans suffering from PTSD and TBI.  This research study analyzed the effectiveness of a digitally networked environment to deliver desired training and certification outcomes in a military healthcare environment.  The level of acceptance of an ad hoc network technology (GridstreamRx) by healthcare professionals using it as an enabler of collaboration during the training process was evaluated.  The results also assessed the readiness of healthcare professionals to use this Information Communications Technology (ICT), or analogous new applications and services, to help them perform their healthcare responsibilities.This thesis study, accomplished with the support of the U.S. Army and National Science Foundation, took place at two large military medical centers over a twelve-month period of time.  Data was gathered from 568 healthcare professionals using quantitative survey instruments.  Ninety-six respondents provided additional quantitative and qualitative inputs at various times during a proscribed training regimen.  DeLone and McLean's 2003 Information System Success Model, modified by findings of more recent research, provided the theoretical lens for analyzing the data from 32 of the training participants in determining the perceived net benefit of the GridstreamRx technology.The data gathered for the study showed, at the 95% level of confidence, that a majority of the professionals of these two medical centers would perceive a positive net benefit from using GridstreamRx in a healthcare training environment.  The conclusion from this analysis was that not only are the healthcare providers in this study ready to use ICT and social networking in this professional setting, but also that GridstreamRx is an acceptable platform for performing these functions.The study participants provided input with respect to their priorities regarding information sharing techniques, functionality, and suggestions for improving the platform.  The outcomes confirmed that GridstreamRx can be a successful introduction of ad hoc networking to telemedicine.  This thesis concluded with recommendations for scholars and practitioners to pursue in the future; and should be followed up with further research and actions in order to build toward a Fully Integrated Virtual Healthcare Environment (FivHe)."

The relationship between early developmental trauma is ascertained through the Childhood Traumatic Events Scale (Pennebaker & Susman, 1988), which consists of events that respondents could report having experienced prior to the age of 17. Additional outcome measures that were given include the Post-Traumatic Growth inventory (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996), the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (Spreng et al., 2009) and the Types of Intuition Scale (Pretz et al., 2014). There were 28 participants, 23 of which reported one trauma or more and 16 with two or more exposures. There were 5 participants who reported having experienced no trauma prior to 17 years of age. Preliminary analyses were conducted between non-trauma (no trauma), trauma (1 or more traumatic experiences) and polytrauma (2 or more traumatic experiences) subgroups. It was hypothesized that clinicians with complex trauma histories (having experienced more than one traumatic event during childhood) would have heightened intuitive capacity; and that clinicians with trauma histories will have heightened intuition compared to clinicians without a history of trauma. Results indicate potential predictor variables of trauma exposure, intensity, and empathy yielding various types of intuition. One limitation within the research was a small sample size, which impacted the analyses conducted.However, results show a correlatory trend to lend in future research addressing complex trauma and intuition in clinician populations or other."

Online survey methodology was used for data collection and included a demographic questionnaire and two survey instruments: the K-4 Physical Science Misconceptions Oriented Science Assessment Resources for Teachers (MOSART) and the Beliefs About Reformed Science Teaching and Learning (BARSTL). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to assess the separate and collective contributions of background variables such as principals' personal and school characteristics, principals' science teaching and learning beliefs, and principals' science knowledge on students' superior science outcomes. Mediation analysis was also used to explore whether principals' science knowledge mediated the relationship between their beliefs about science teaching and learning and students' science outcomes.Findings indicated that principals' science beliefs and knowledge do not contribute to predicting students' superior science scores. Fifty-two percent of the variance in percentage of students with superior science scores was explained by school characteristics with free or reduced price lunch and school type as the only significant individual predictors. Furthermore, principals' science knowledge did not mediate the relationship between their science beliefs and students' science outcomes. There was no statistically significant variation among the variables. The data failed to support the proposed mediation model of the study. Implications for future research are discussed."

Firstly, I demonstrate the core and core/shell type qdots synthesis using microwave-induced hydrothermal approach and discussed their optical properties. Hydrothermal temperature could be achieved and aqueous processing was greatly facilitated, allowing for the qdot size control, narrowing size distributions, and improved quantum yields. I next discuss the DNA-mediated self-assembly study of qdots in the view of the resonance energy transfer. The ssDNA was firstly functionalized on the CdSe/ZnS qdots and gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface through several different approaches. In chapter three, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method was applied to explain the qdot PL spectral changes when it is combined with the organic fluorophore and elucidate this qdot-DNA-fluorophore structure. In chapter four, CdSe/ZnS qdot PL quenching and recovery system was demonstrated by introducing the DNA functionalized AuNPs. Here, the DNA-mediated self-assembly was applied and nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) analysis performed to explain this qodt-AuNP interactions. PL quenching and recovery was detected and the separation distance was considered for qdot-AuNP assembly structures. In chapter five, I discuss on the qdot PL quenching with Au, Au/Ag, and Au/Pd NPs, considering surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signatures. Further inner filter effect was considered with specific Stern-Volmer constatns. Lasty, I demonstrate the solid support assembly of multi-color qdot clusters using DNA-mediated self-assembly. CdSe/ZnS qdot was phase-transferred into aqueous buffers through amphiphilic polymer wrapping and ssDNA was functionalized on resulting aqueous qdots. PL recovery of two qdot peaks was clearly shown, indicating the successful formation of multi-color qdot clusters and qdot to qdot ratio can be systematically regulated upon initial introducing amounts of qdots."
etd_51,Investigating the Activity of Metal Pyrophosphate Complexes against Select Pathogenic Organisms,Chemistry,,"Herein, metallo-pyrophosphate complexes have been designed and synthesized, in which pyrophosphate is chelated to multiple metals, with an emphasis on cobalt and copper metal centers.  These complexes have diverse and interesting behaviors ranging from cooperative magnetism to anti-mycobacterial properties.The latter application is one of the main focuses of this work, investigating cobalt(II) and copper(II) pyrophosphate complexes as antibacterial agents.  In particular, a cobalt(II) pyrophosphate complex with an aromatic capping donor ligand has selectivity and potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB).  TB causes up to 10 million incident cases per year, with an estimated annual death toll of two million.  The need for innovative TB therapy has been stressed, and this research has resulted in new lead compounds for the treatment of TB, with a cobalt(II) pyrophosphate complex having activity comparable to current first-line TB therapy.In addition to antibacterial agents, the application of metallo-pyrophosphate complexes has been extended to the more complex eukaryotic fungus kingdom.  Species of Candida are focused on, as Candida is the causative agent of common yeast infection and life-threatening candidemia, which has high morbidity and mortality rates.  Cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes were tested for activity against multiple clinical isolates from patients with active infection.  Varying degrees of efficacy have been discovered, which could be assigned based on the particular clinical isolate and the particular metal center in different Candida species.  More in depth studies, such as the activity in metal-transport protein knock-outs and efflux assays, have also been conducted."
etd_263,INVESTIGATING THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENTS AND INFORMATION USE TASKS WITH RESPECT TO DOCUMENT GENRES IN THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING,School of Information Studies,"Credibility assessments, Document assessments, Document genres, Information practices, Information tasks, Information use","Higher education requires intense information practices for knowledge diffusion, application, and innovation. Faculty assess and use a variety of documents when they teach their students. They make complex credibility assessments, and they use information with varying degrees of perceived credibility to achieve their teaching goals. Unfortunately, existing credibility research often stops once documents are selected. Our knowledge of the associations between credibility assessments and information use remains limited. Additionally, scholars agree professional tasks are associated with the genres of the documents used to accomplish these tasks. For example, instructional genres – including tutorials and lesson plans – are particularly useful to tasks related to educational pursuits. Despite the potential benefits that the identification of genres might provide in searching, navigation, and comprehension of information, researchers rarely exploit it to facilitate faculty’s document assessments and information use in support of their teaching.To solve the above problems, this study aimed at uncovering the associations between credibility assessments and information use tasks with respect to document genres in the context of university teaching. Specifically, it investigated whether there were associations: (1) between the criteria faculty employed to assess the credibility of the documents they used to support their teaching and the genres of these documents; (2) between the credibility criteria they employed to assess and the information use tasks they performed to use these documents; and (3) between the genres of these documents and the information use tasks they performed. Understanding the above associations could enhance our knowledge of the roles of document genres in making credibility assessments and information use decisions in the context of university teaching.This study took a mixed-method, bottom-up approach to uncovering the above associations. It first employed qualitative citation analysis to identify the genres of the documents faculty used in their courses based on the citations in their teaching materials (e.g., syllabi, lecture slides, lab notes, and links to resources). Customized genre repertoires that detailed the contexts in which different genres were used in Excel format were created. Semi-structured interviews were then implemented to collect data about the courses included in this study, the general criteria faculty employed to select documents for their courses, the tasks they performed to use the information in the genres this study selected for in-depth interviews, and the criteria they employed to assess the selected genres. Interviews were fully transcribed for qualitative content analysis.The results of this study indicate the criteria faculty employed served as function enablers that bridged the selected genres and the information use tasks they performed to use these genres. Credibility was one of the function enablers that enabled faculty to use the selected genres to perform different tasks. It played different roles in different tasks. It played a leading role in teaching tasks that developed students’ advanced learning skills and helped students to continue their learning. It also played a leading role in information use tasks that involved subject experts, professional orginations, and diverse genres originated from heterogeneous sources. The results also indicate the information use tasks faculty performed served as inclusion and exclusion criteria for genres. The information use tasks determined the information characteristics of genres that mattered in faculty’s task performance.This study shed new light on existing knowledge about genre-task associations by: (1) Exploring these associations in the context of university teaching; (2) Explicating these associations through the perception of credibility; and (3) Adding the criterion-genre and criterion-task associations to complement these associations. This study also enhanced our understanding of credibility in the context of university teaching. Finally, this study made several methodological contributions, including: (1) Transforming citation analysis from bibliographic records to research tools that engaged participants and ensured the accuracy of data; (2) Transforming citation analysis from bibliographic records to customized genre repertoires that preserved the contexts of information use; and (3) Developing rules to consistently select genres for investigating task-genre associations across disciplinary boundaries."

These quantum parameters are sensitive to the conditions in which they are prepared, and chemical synthesis can lead to a wide variety of types. In my dissertation research, I designed synthetic protocols for QDs and QRs to have tailored morphologies, aspect ratios, and microstructures for energy transfer applications. The role of QRs as energy acceptors in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) with firefly luciferase enzymes is a particular focus. In this thesis I show how changing morphology and aspect ratio of QRs can help to optimize BRET efficiency. My work revealed that CdSe/CdS QRs with rod-in-rod morphology are the most efficient BRET acceptors. In order to gain insight into the origin of this high efficiency, systematic BRET studies were preformed using QRs of varied aspect ratios and emission wavelengths. To study the effect of bioluminescent donor energy level on BRET, I used three different combinations of modified firefly luciferase and the luciferin substrate, producing blue-green, green, and red bioluminescence. To gain insights into the binding location and mechanism of the enzyme on the QR, I monitored surface defects, by growing gold nanoparticles on the surface, which nucleate at defect sites. I extended our approach and made a near Infrared (nIR) BRET nanoconjugate, in which green bioluminescence was converted to nIR emission. Finally, I describe our latest advance that involves two-step sequential resonance energy transfer was observed in which QDs are used as an energy acceptor and donor, which was facilitated by secondary attachment of a red fluorescent protein."
etd_745,"Investigating the Structures of Turbulence in a Multi-stream, Rectangular, Supersonic Jet",Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Jet, Multi-stream, Rectangular, Supersonic, Turbulence","Supersonic flight has become a standard for military aircraft, and is being seriously reconsidered for commercial applications.  Engine technologies, enabling increased mission capabilities and vehicle performance, have evolved nozzles into complex geometries with intricate flow features.  These engineering solutions have advanced at a faster rate than the understanding of the flow physics, however.  The full consequences of the flow are thus not known, and using predictive tools becomes exceedingly difficult.  Additionally, the increasing velocities associated with supersonic flight exacerbate the preexisting jet noise problem, which has troubled the engineering community for nearly 65 years.  Even in the simplest flows, the full consequences of turbulence, e.g. noise production, are not fully understood.  For composite flows, the fluid mechanics and acoustic properties have been studied even less sufficiently.  Before considering the aeroacoustic problem, the development, structure, and evolution of the turbulent flow-field must be considered.  This has prompted an investigation into the compressible flow of a complex nozzle.Experimental evidence is sought to explain the stochastic processes of the turbulent flow issuing from a complex geometry.  Before considering the more complicated configuration, an experimental campaign of an axisymmetric jet is conducted.  The results from this study are presented, and guide research of the primary flow under investigation.  The design of a nozzle representative of future engine technologies is then discussed.  Characteristics of this multi-stream rectangular supersonic nozzle are studied via time-resolved schlieren imaging, stereo PIV measurements, dynamic pressure transducers, and far-field acoustics.  Experiments are carried out in the anechoic chamber at Syracuse University, and focus primarily on the flow-field.  An extensive data set is generated, which reveals a detailed view of a very complex flow.  Shear, shock waves, unequal entrainment, compressibility, and geometric features of the nozzle heavily influence the development of this jet plume.  In the far-field, the acoustic radiation is found to be highly directional.  Noise spectra contain high-frequency tonal signatures, and relations to the turbulent structures are made in an effort to explain the physics responsible for such acoustic generation.Analysis of the flow is made possible by the carefully planned experiments.  By acquiring a large number of simultaneous data points, the stochastic processes are studied through statistical approaches.  First- and second-order moments are used to describe the steady-state behavior of the flow.  The wide array of sensors used in the tests allows for cross-moments to be computed, which provide evidence linking different phenomena.  Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to separate flow-field quantities into temporal and spatial pieces, which are then further utilized in conjunction with other sensors.  Through these methods, a high-frequency instability is discovered in the near-field of the jet, which pervades the flow-field and propagates ubiquitously throughout the acoustic domain.  Additionally, the complex shock structure is found to play a vital role in redistributing disturbances throughout the flow.  Finally, several POD modes in the side shear layer of the jet are found to be correlated with acoustic production."

These unique properties make gQDs excellent candidates for applications in lasers, single molecular probes and solid state LEDs. Although a growing wealth of knowledge exists for the photophysical properties of the gQDs, limited research has been directed towards understanding the synthetic intricacies and crystal growth. In this dissertation work I present a detailed study of the growth of CdSe/CdZnS multishell gQDs and focus on crystallographic and morphological evolution. I studied the effect of core crystalstructure and shell growth was performed on crystallographically disparate (W, wurtzite and ZB, zinc blende) CdSe cores under identical synthetic conditions. My work revealed that while shell growth transitioned to W type growth in both cases, occurrence of unique W-ZB mixed crystallinity (polytypism) was significant and might result in the final gQDs as a consequence of the ligands and reaction conditions involved in the traditional synthesis. Next, I investigated the influence of the shell anion precursor concentrations on gQD growth employing identical W cores, by altering the mode of addition and three different sources of sulfur. Experimental results indicated that delicate interplay of crystal structure preference and ligands involved in the synthesis resulted in varied morphologies (rod, tripodal, trigonal and polyhedral) and crystal structures (W, ZB, W-ZB and ZB respectively) of gQDs in each of the syntheses."
etd_370,Investigation of Core/Shell Nanoparticle Surface Functionalization and Applications,Chemistry,,"Nanoparticles are small objects with sizes between 1-100 nm and can have varying properties depending on size or shape. The focus in this thesis is preparing three different nanomaterials, quantum dots, quantum rods, and metal halide perovskites. First, two different protocols to synthesize CdSe/CdS and CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and continuous injection, will be compared. There I will focus on how the protocols affect the optical properties in the hope of forming more stable and brighter quantum dots. Surface chemistry of nanoparticles is also very important. Here, I utilized the surface interactions of quantum rods to site-selectively coat CdSe/CdS quantum rods in a silica shell, which were then further functionalized. Lastly, I prepared metal halide, CsPbX3 X = Br- or I-, perovskite nanoparticles, which are able to undergo anion exchange in solution. However, moisture sensitivity of perovskite nanomaterials has proven to be an issue in the past. To improve moisture stability, I coated the surfaces of perovskite nanomaterials, allowing them to be more stable in moisture than typical uncoated perovskites."
etd_331,Investigation of Electrostatic Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles Mediated by Giant Polyoxomolybdate Clusters,Chemistry,"electrostatic, gold, nanoparticles, polyoxometalate, POMs, self assembly","Nanoscience has shifted its focus from studying properties of individual nanoparticles toward using these nanoparticles as building blocks to assemble larger systems. One approach to this end is to exploit electrostatic self-assembly through the interaction of oppositely charged nanoparticles to form larger superstructures and even crystalline superlattices. Metal nanoparticles, such as gold, have been used to design such structures, but understanding the mechanics of the self-assembly can be elusive due to their random size and charge distributions. However, a certain class of polyoxomolybdates can provide insights into how electrostatic self-assembly occurs with their precise size dimensions and charges.In the first investigation, the electrostatic assembly between a series of the differently charged polyoxomolybdate-type Keplerates of (NH4)42[{(MoVI)MoVI5O21(H2O)6}12{MoV2O4(CH3COO)}30]? ?300 H2O ? ? 10 CH3COONH4 (Mo-132a), (NH4)72[{(MoVI)MoVI5O21(H2O)6}12{MoV2O4(SO4)}30] ? ?200 H2O (Mo-132b) and Na10(NH4)62[{(MoVI)MoVI5O21(H2O)6}12{MoV2O4(HPO4)}30] ? ?300 H2O ? ?2Na+ - ?2NH4+ ? ?4 H2PO4 (Mo-132c) with cationic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was explored for the first time. The rapid electrostatic assembly from nanoscopic entities to micron scale aggregates was observed upon precipitation, which closely matched the point of aggregate electroneutrality. Successful assembly was demonstrated using UV-vis, DLS, TEM, and zeta-potential analysis. Results indicate that the point at which precipitation occurs is related to charge balance or electroneutrality, and that counter-ions at both the Mo-132 and AuNP play a significant role in assembly.The subsequent investigation, focused on certain counterintuitive results of the previous study of Mo-132 and AuNP aggregates by manipulating the AuNP core diameter. We hypothesized that a AuNP core diameter of comparable size to Mo-132 would lower the rE0 (equivalence molar ratio, r = [Mo-132]:[Au]) between the nanomaterials, whereas a larger AuNP core would raise the rE0. The range of sizes allowed assessment of how counter-ions affect assembly based on comparable dimensions of the nanomaterials. It was found that a smaller AuNP core size of 1.6 nm produced the naively anticipated results based on charge yielding a rE0, molar ratio of ca. 1.0 at electroneutrality. However, even at this favorable rE0 unorganized aggregates were observed. These findings suggested that crystallization could not be based on charge considerations alone, but that the size relation between the nanomaterials must also be taken into account to induce crystallization.In the last investigation, the electrostatic self-assembly of the polyoxomolybdate (NH4)28[Mo154(NO)14O420(OH)14(H2O)70]? 350 H2O (Mo-154) and AuNPs of different size was studied to explore the aspect of asymmetry in these colloidal systems. The aim of this work was to observe the dependence electrostatic interactions may have on asymmetric shaped nanomaterials. The ring-shaped Mo-154 structure gave this study a unique view on how the polarity of electron density can affect the molar ratio, r = [Mo-154]:[Au]. It was shown that the van der Waals attraction forces of Mo-154, in comparison to Mo-132, were stronger resulting in a lower rE0."
etd_689,Investigation of the multi-physics of laser-induced ignition of transportation fuels,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,,"Cleaner and more efficient combustion systems are expected to operate at conditions where successful spark ignition is difficult to achieve. Laser ignition is a proposed alternative ignition system capable of stable engine performance under these conditions. Fundamental studies are needed to fully characterize the complex, multi-physics nature of the laser ignition process. This thesis is a contribution in that direction, also characterizing the ignition and flame behavior of some engine-relevant fuels.This work investigates experimentally the early stages of the laser ignition process, characterizing breakdown and laser-induced shock waves. It then explores self-sustained flame behavior from early flame emergence to complete propagation or quenching.Regarding the early stages of laser ignition, the influence of focusing optics, thermodynamic conditions, and chemical structure of fuels on optical breakdown threshold is examined. These results are presented in a universal representation of the breakdown threshold, facilitating their comparison. The results agree with previous studies and new data sets are generated.Thermomechanical differences between breakdown in non-reactive and reactive mixtures are quantified, isolating the effect of exothermicity on plasma and shock wave propagation. The thermodynamic conditions of the gas near the focal volume are investigated and quantified using two-color interferometry. This information is applied toward developing accurate initial conditions for simulations based on absorbed laser energy and early kernel geometry.With respect to flame propagation, schlieren and interferometric imaging techniques are used to examine early flame behavior, especially near flammability limits. This provides insight into the mechanisms controlling quenching of fuel-lean laser ignited flames as well as the time-scales involved. Four fuels (methane, biogas, iso-octane, and E85) are characterized, highlighting thermochemical effects which control their flame kernel development, the dynamics, and fate of initially sustained flames.Laser ignition is further put into context by contrasting with the better established spark ignition process. The duration of energy deposition and heat transfer to the spark plug electrodes are found to be the main reasons for differences between laser and spark ignited flames.By examining these different physical aspects of laser ignition, this thesis advances understanding of forced ignition, consolidating this by contrasting with spark-ignition behavior. The results are useful for the design of fuel-flexible and lean combustion technologies. The data set is also useful for CFD simulations and simplified modeling of the ignition process."

In the interdisciplinary field of investor relations, professionals need both finance and communication expertise to achieve effective investor relations results. This paper investigates investor relations professionals' perceptions of the fundamental skills and practices needed in corporations and agencies through an online self-administered survey. It finds that the professionals perceived relationship-building skills with media and the investment community to be the most important. A knowledge of information disclosure process, senior management assistance and crisis communication management were also seen as important. The professionals indicated that improving skills and knowledge of communications and finance was as important as the skills themselves. This study also finds that professionals with different affiliations and levels of experience have different perceptions of the fundamental skills and practices in the field of investor relations."

In my exploration of what I call ""irreconcilable mourning,"" I question whether and how people transmit and take responsibility for the catastrophes of earlier generations. What are the motivations not to forget the past? How do these concerns translate philosophically, in material sites of mourning, and in specific forms of narrative and history writing? I first reinterpret the concept of mourning in order to understand it not only as psychological grieving but as an activity with temporal, historical, ethical, and political resonances important to religion and philosophy. From this foundation, I proceed in the second half to examine how irreconcilable mourning takes hold in the postwar religious ""situations"" presented in post-Holocaust and post-Bomb Japanese narratives. I argue that the response to loss that I have called ""irreconcilable mourning"" is not a static event or moment but an ongoing, fluid process across generations."
etd_527,Is disability a diversity issue?: Diversity workers and the construction of disability in higher education,Cultural Foundations of Education,"Ableism, Affirmative Action, Disability, Disability Studies, Diversity, Higher Education","This dissertation explored how 23 college presidents, senior administrators, faculty and staff at six college campuses in the northeast United States understood diversity and disability and how these perspectives were positioned from their personal experiences, larger campus initiatives, and institutional cultures.  Even as higher education scholars and practitioners work to increase educational opportunities for historically underserved populations (Cuyjet, Howard-Hamilton, & Cooper, 2011; Orfield, 2001; Quaye & Harper, 2015) and a growing body of research indicates that being part of a diverse college community can enhance development in leadership skills, critical thinking, and cross-cultural communication (Baxter-Magolda, 1992; Chang, Denson, Saenz, & Misa, 2006; Gurin, Nagda, & Lopez, 2004), there is little inquiry into how disability is situated within this work.  Compliance with civil rights statutes made important strides for holding postsecondary institutions accountable to diverse demographics of society but did not fully dismantle structural practices and attitudinal beliefs that underserved groups were lacking in academic potential.  Universities have acknowledged the category of disability as the result of hard-fought civil rights campaigns and federal legislation.  However, findings from this research indicate that disability’s close proximity to individualized, biomedical discourses kept this social group apart from other work designed to engender diversity in higher education.  These diversity workers’ perspectives on both diversity and disability illuminated the ways ableism functioned in the arenas of higher education and how it influenced shared experiences with other forms of structural oppression."
etd_188,"IS FAITH ON THE CAMPUS TOUR?  RURAL, PUBLIC COLLEGE STUDENTS' EXPLORATION OF SPIRITUAL AND RELIGIOUS IDENTITY",Higher Education,"college, identity, intersectionality, religion, rural, spirituality","This dissertation examined how students of diverse spiritual or religious beliefs or worldviews at a rural, public college interpreted, made meaning of, and drew upon their spirituality in relation to other aspects of their identity (e.g., race, gender, sexual identity), focusing particularly on the intersections of students' multiple marginalized identities.  It was a single-site, qualitative study involving 20 participants attending a rural, mid-sized, predominantly-White northeastern public university.  The researcher used semi-structured, in-person interviews, gathering and analyzing data using symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969) with the critical stance possible from applying the lens of the Reconceptualized Model of Multiple Dimensions of Identity (Abes, Jones, & McEwen, 2007).  The study provided evidence of the considerable influence of context, in this case geography (rural setting).Results produced five findings of note which serve to enhance educators' understanding of rural, public college students' spiritual identity development.  One, those students identifying with a faith tradition ascribed a great deal of importance to the possibility for affiliation with others of like beliefs at college.  For some, affiliation concerns affected both their choice of college and their spiritual identity exploration while attending college.  Two, the students did not look to the College to provide venues for spiritual expression, largely navigating their exploration without reinforcement from student affairs, faculty, or other arm of the college.  Three, some students, seeking connection, community, predictability, and identity with others sharing a common history, culture, and/or set of beliefs (i.e., intersection of similar multiple categories), formed their own organizations such as gospel choir or chapter of Hillel.  Particularly, Jewish respondents did not perceive the College or surrounding area as offering a culturally-familiar atmosphere or space within which to feel a part, and African-American participants did not perceive either as offering a culturally-familiar space within which to worship.  Students identifying as gay selected places to worship based solely on those institutions' professed acceptance of the students' sexual identity.Four, students drew on their spiritual or religious understanding to negotiate everyday college life as well as to test their beliefs and assumptions about controversial issues.  They used practices such as prayer, meditation, or singing praises for comfort in negotiating everyday life and stressors.  A number of Protestant students perceived that non-Christian students looked first to forms of substance abuse to cope with daily college stressors.  Finally, in college classrooms, many students perceived resistance to discussion or acceptance of spirituality or religion, a hindrance that often led to increased tension rather than enhanced understanding."
etd_58,"Isolation of polyacetylene: Exploring the properties of isolated, oriented, and insulated polyacetylene utilizing inclusion crystal chemistry",Chemistry,"Inclusion compounds, Polyacetylene","The creation of isolated, oriented and insulated polyacetylene (PA) chains was assisted by utilizing the favorable features of self assembling inclusion compounds to form inclusion complexes (IC). Calculations suggesting that conducting or even superconducting behavior is anticipated for a one-dimensional, ""infinite"", isolated PA chain led to the desire to experimentally synthesize this polymer in a manner consistent with the model underlying the theoretical treatment. A two-pronged approach was taken to accomplish this objective. The first method proposed was to isolate a small molecule PA precursor, with terminal end groups that are favorable to cleavage with UV irradiation, in an IC. The small molecule chosen was (E,E)-1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene (DIBD) due to the easy cleavage of C-I bonds and stereochemically pure synthesis. Once isolated in an IC, UV-light was used to polymerize the monomer unit. The second method proposed was to simultaneously grow PA while it was encapsulated by an IC. This was attempted by utilizing olefin metathesis with the Grubbs group of catalysts to grow the polymer in a solution containing the desired host molecule. As the polymer forms the host molecule should encapsulate the polymer.The small molecule inclusion method produced DIBD UICs with three different formation techniques: slow evaporation, slow cooling, and vapor transfer. All crystals formed had the same unit cell, which suggests that the same crystal structure was formed by all methods. These crystals were irradiated with 254 or 532 nm light, and the resulting photoproducts in the UICs were probed by Raman spectroscopy. These results showed that both irradiation wavelengths converted the isolated monomer to PA. This conversion was observed to occur selectively at the surface of the crystal when 254 nm light was used, likely due to strong absorption of the 254 nm radiation by the DIBD monomer in the crystal. The 532 nm sample showed deeper penetration into the DIBD UIC. This deeper penetration resulted in a higher amount of DIBD converted to PA in the UIC versus the use of 254 nm light. This is important because to have complete conversion within the UIC light will need to penetrate completely through the crystal.The simultaneous inclusion and polymerization method was attempted with both urea and tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclotriphosphazene (TPP) to form ICs. Possible PA ICs resulted from the work with TPP and was consistent with PA inclusion. Melting point was the first characterization technique attempted with the possible ICs but the data was very inconclusive. FT-IR was the second characterization technique attempted, the data showed a change in the vibrations associated with PA, suggesting something was different about the material formed in this manner versus the unrestricted bulk polymer. X-ray data was then taken of the material which appeared to indicate a hexagonal host lattice with a possible disordered guest present within it.The potential uses for this material are mostly in the electronics industry. Conductive polymers are most useful in OLED TVs, Li-polymer batteries, and thin film solar cell application. If these PA ICs show strong conductive behavior the main use for them would be as batteries or in molecular circuits. If superconducting behavior is observed then it could fundamentally shift our understanding of conducting polymers. This would represent a huge leap forward in organic molecular electronics research. This PA research could also lend insight into graphene or carbon nanotubes since these two materials are heavily studied for their desirable properties but face many similar synthetic challenges."
etd_739,"Isotopic characterization of bedrock, sediments, and minerals as provenance tools: Examples from an inselberg in the Mojave Desert of SE California",Earth Sciences,"Apatite, Detrital, Geochemistry, Isotope, Provenance, Zircon","Our understanding of the evolution of the Earth’s surface is driven by our knowledge and comprehension of the processes which shape the landscape.  The source, formation, and transport pathways of sediment are critical components to understanding crustal processes and changes and are often grouped under the broad scope of provenance analysis. Much of what we know of how sediments evolve and shape our landscape stems from provenance analysis, which tries to trace the pathway of source to sink.  However, complexities arise when the final composition or signature of the detrital material is altered, which results in provenance signature deviations from source rock to the sediment.  Weathering, erosion, mixing, recycling, sorting, diagenesis, and/or lithification can all drive these changes in sediment signatures.In the following chapters, I test both the strengths and limitations of some of the commonly used fingerprints in detrital analysis to a single case study of the Stepladder pluton. The Cretaceous Stepladder pluton (SE California) provides a unique environment to test some of the most basic assumptions of provenance analysis. The pluton should act as a point source for sediments collected downslope, which have experienced limited transport and have been deposited in in an arid (limited chemical alteration) environment.In Chapter 1, I present zircon U-Pb age data of the Stepladder pluton and derived sediments. With limited transport and an essentially unimodal age source, sediments derived from the inselberg should theoretically have matching age distributions with the pluton itself. However, our results show an unexpected and dramatic difference in age distributions between bedrock and detrital samples. A clear secondary source, one unassociated with the ‘upstream’ bedrock, dominates the detrital distributions.  The differences in age distributions between the source and sinks suggest that interpreting parent rock assemblages and paleogeographic reconstructions solely on zircon geochronology can be misleading or contain significantly more complexity than what researchers assume.To better constrain the provenance of the Stepladder Pluton sediments, I present dual characterization of single-grain apatite in chapter 2 as a new potential fingerprint for detrital provenance. 87Sr/86Sr ratios and (U-Th)/He ages are two independent isotopic signatures.  The first provides the diagnostic magmatic signature, while the second provides a low temperature thermochronometer, which describes the exhumation or cooling history of the apatite.  The focus of this chapter is to present the methodological protocols used to obtain the 87Sr/86Sr ratios and (U-Th)/He ages, and to describe the various tests we used to determine the source of Sr excess developed during He degassing. Further work is needed to determine a Sr correction factor or search for an alternative He degassing method, as (U-Th)/He ages are not affected by Sr chromatography, but Sr isotopic ratios are clearly altered during the degassing process.Research presented in chapter 3 focuses on using apatite and whole-rock geochemistry as fingerprints for provenance studies. Here, I collected whole-rock 87Sr/86Sr ratios, apatite 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and apatite (U-Th)/He ages from both the Stepladder pluton and its derived sediments. We find that minimal variations in whole-rock initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the bedrock are likely due to heterogeneities within the Stepladder pluton, while the much larger observed variations in detrital sample ratios are due to hydraulic sorting of altered biotite. Single grain and multi-grain apatite isotopic signatures are not affected by hydraulic sorting, and thus may provide a more accurate determination of source rocks. Strontium isotopic ratios of most detrital apatite grains are similar to that of the bedrock from which they are derived. Igneous and detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages are also notably similar, confirming with two independent isotopic systems that apatite is a more robust fingerprint of source than zircon and whole-rock geochemistry."
eng_etd_63,"Jailbreakers, Villains, and Vampires: Representations of Criminality in Early-Victorian Popular Texts",English,"crime, genre, lower-class, penny bloods, prisons, Victorian","In Jailbreakers, Villains, and Vampires: Representations of Criminality in Early-Victorian Popular Texts, I analyze moments of discursive dissonance that emerge through the juxtaposition of early-Victorian theories of criminality and representations of criminals in popular culture. In the 1830s and 1840s in England, methods for managing criminals underwent a series of revisions that corresponded to shifts in prevailing theories about the nature and course of criminal behavior. Assumptions that criminality was volitional, or that it originated in an individual's deficient self-discipline, gradually shifted into perceptions that criminality was pathological, and that malefactors were naturally brutish and incorrigible. Predominant conceptions of criminality as stemming from character flaws or biological predispositions influenced depictions of criminals in a variety of Victorian popular texts including novels, plays, and, importantly, penny bloods, which were cheap publications marketed to lower-class readers. Such popular lower-class texts are rife with criminals and crimes yet their representations of criminality remain understudied. This penny literature often reproduces prevailing middle-class discourses about criminality, but these texts do so in ways that simultaneously disrupt those discourses. Specifically, popular culture tends to locate the origins of crime not in criminals but in the very institutions and social structures designed to regulate them. Analyzing popular representations of criminals in lower-class texts at a transitional moment in penal history demonstrates how conflicts between legitimate and subordinate cultures activated antidisciplinary potentialities.While historical and literary scholarship on middle-class crime fiction has flourished, crime literature popular with the lower classes has been largely neglected. Understanding how both dominant and subordinate literatures responded to and portrayed significant shifts in cultural theories and practices is, however, necessary to gain a fuller, more nuanced understanding of Victorian literature and culture. There is plenty of evidence available that suggests ways in which middle-class commentators interpreted the beliefs of the lower-classes, but much less is known about the views and narratives that were attractive to and so consumed, via this literature, by these audiences. Studying literature read by the lower-classes, especially those texts that were tremendously popular, is one step toward gaining insight into the possible interpretations of a largely inaccessible audience."
etd_183,Kant and the Neglected Alternative,Philosophy,"Critique of Pure Reason, Kant, Neglected Alternative, Pistorius, space and time, Trendelenburg","In this work, I conduct a reconstruction and evaluation of the Neglected  Alternative objection to Immanuel Kant's philosophy. Kant famously argues in the Transcendental Aesthetic section of the Critique of Pure Reason that space and time are subjective forms of human intuition, and the Neglected Alternative maintains that this argument is a failure. According to the Neglected Alternative, Kant completely overlooks the possibility that space and time are in some way both subjective and objective, and so Kant's conclusions about the nature of space and time are not justified by his arguments. This objection was first formulated very soon after the publication of the Critique of Pure Reason but is still subject to great controversy among Kant scholars.I argue that the Neglected Alternative objection is unsuccessful. To do this, I provide a close analysis of Kant's key technical term ""a priori intuition,"" and I reconstruct the work of two important critics of Kant: H.A. Pistorius and F.A. Trendelenburg. I then argue that in the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant is justified in deriving the conclusion that space and time have nothing to do with things in themselves, or objects entirely independent of human cognition. Finally, I look at Kant's works as a whole and consider Kant's arguments that seem to rule out the possibility that things in themselves have a structure that is even similar to space and time."
phi_etd_73,"Kant, Derivative Influence, and the Metaphysics of Causality",Philosophy,"Causality, Cause, Derivative Influence, Dogmatic Slumber, Hume, Kant","Kant tells us in the Prolegomena's autobiographical note that Hume interrupted his dogmatic slumber. This declaration has traditionally dictated the interpretive limits of Kant's causal theory. That dogmatic slumber has been largely misunderstood, and as a result, so has Kant's metaphysics of causality. The pre-critical Kant was not exposed to Hume's skepticism of necessary connection precisely because he too subscribed to a theory in which substances are not necessarily connected. Instead, Kant's enduring metaphysics of causality, which Kant refers to as `Derivative Influence' or `Generally Established Harmony,' remained largely intact even through his Copernican revolution. This thesis traces the elements of Kant's enduring metaphysics of cause from his pre-critical work to the Critique. It also covers Kant's actual slumber which consisted in his not having a viable, ready-to-hand answer to explain to Hume how we have access to the causal concept. To overcome the impasse and to give a viable account, Kant endeavors to relocate the causal schema, formally thought of as being in the mind of God, to the finite mind. The previously overlooked elements of Kant's causal metaphysics give insight into Kant's treatment of causality in the Second and Third Analogies of Experience. There, Kant looks to sustain Newtonian arguments while also explaining how independent existents gain co-existence with other existents."
etd_56,"Khwaja Sira: Culture, Identity Politics, and ""Transgender"" Activism in Pakistan",Anthropology,"Activism, Deception, Identity, Sexuality, Stigma, Transgender","In 2009, the Pakistani Supreme Court began granting rights to gender ambiguous people who are locally known as khwaja siras. The Court organized this population into taxonomic groups and ordered the government to `mainstream' them. These actions were based on certain cultural assumptions and occurred amid uncertainties about who khwaja siras really were. Meanwhile, khwaja siras began to mobilize in an effort to control their public image. Based on fourteen months of ethnographic fieldwork on the identity politics of khwaja siras in Karachi, this dissertation seeks to understand the ways in which gender ambiguous people constructed, negotiated and represented themselves both within their social networks and in the wider society, as well as the factors underpinning their public portrayals. I conceive khwaja sira politics as a `game', that is, as the art of manipulation and concealment. I argue that the games of secrecy and deception in which this minority population engaged were responses to the stigma they experienced in everyday life.Khwaja sira relationships with the general public were strategic game-like interactions that were meant to conceal knowledge, misrepresent gender variant people, and confuse opponents. They allowed khwaja siras to maintain ambiguity about their corporeality, conceal their sexualized lifestyle, and seek inclusion into mainstream society. These everyday forms of agency and deceit emerged on a larger scale and in far more sophisticated ways in the realm of activism. However, social stigma was so pervasive that it permeated into the khwaja sira cultural system, impacting the self-esteem of its members and triggering identity wars between them. These fissures were replicated within activist spaces where they often stifled efforts to empower khwaja siras. The games of secrecy and deception that gender variant people played both facilitated and undermined their movement. These empowering and conscious acts of self preservation enhanced their security within an oppressive social environment. However, khwaja sira politics did not promote understanding of gender and sexual difference. These provisional solutions perpetuated ambiguity about khwaja siras, temporarily grazing the surface of their struggles without promoting long-term stigma reduction."
etd_554,Kinetics of ketone hydrogenation over supported Ru catalysts,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Heterogeneous catalysis, Ketone hydrogenation, Levulinic acid, microkinetic modelling, Ruthenium, solvent effects","A kinetic investigation of the production of y-valerolactone (GVL) via the aqueous phase hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) over supported Ru catalysts was carried out, in order to understand how to better design a hydrogenation catalyst for such biomass catalytic strategies. At temperatures representative of biomass processing, the reaction proceeds first through the reduction of the LA ketone group to its corresponding alcohol, 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (HPA), which subsequently produces GVL via intramolecular esterification in solution. The governing kinetics of LA hydrogenation were found to be insensitive to the identity of the support material on which Ru catalysts were prepared. Conversely the stability of supported Ru catalysts in the aqueous phase were strongly dependent on the choice of support, exhibiting severe sintering of Ru nanoparticles, the extent of which appears to be dictated by the bulk electronegative properties of the support material.The presence of a secondary functional group in LA (i.e., a carboxyl group) does not appear to perturb the activity of Ru sites in water, where LA and its mono-functional ketone analog (2-pentanone) hydrogenate at identical rates. LA hydrogenation thus appears kinetically equivalent to that of 2-pentanone. Given the similarity, C3-C5 ketone hydrogenation over Ru/SiO2 in the vapor-phase was examined, alleviating the need to consider solution phase complexities. A single universal microkinetic model for the hydrogenation of ketones over supported Ru catalysts was developed, based on a modified Horiuti-Polanyi-type mechanism involving two distinct surface sites. Through the application of surface lateral interactions to the developed ketone microkinetic model, solvent effects commonly reported for hydrogenations over Ru catalysts are rationalized on the basis of the stabilization of a kinetically relevant transition state."
etd_677,"Knowing Better, Reasoning Together",Philosophy,,"We take ourselves to have some knowledge about what’s right and wrong to do. But how easy is this knowledge to get? In the first two chapters of this dissertation I argue for the novel conclusion that it is harder to have moral knowledge than non-moral knowledge due to the fact that moral beliefs have more practically at stake. More specifically, in chapter 1 I argue that moral beliefs are subject to a higher epistemic standard than non-moral beliefs. Roughly, epistemic standards mark how good of an epistemic position an agent needs to be in in order for her beliefs to receive epistemic credit like knowledge. The higher epistemic standard of moral beliefs offers the only unified explanation to date of long-standing puzzling asymmetries between moral and non-moral epistemology, like how moral testimony, unlike non-moral testimony, is problematic and moral expertise, unlike non-moral expertise, is non-existent.Even so, one may wonder why moral beliefs have such a higher epistemic standard. In chapter 2 I argue that the best account of what fixes the higher epistemic standard for moral beliefs is a practical-stakes account wherein the practical upshots of holding a belief affect how demanding the standard is. Importantly, my account differs from traditional practical-stakes accounts of epistemic standards. First, it locates features of morality as a subject matter, like being subject to the reactive attitudes and the way that moral beliefs typically motivate whereas non-moral beliefs don’t, as that which functions to raise the standard. Second, the stakes that are relevant outrun those stemming from the interests of the individual person whose belief is under assessment, and include the practical interests of other agents. This last feature makes the picture of moral knowledge I offer essentially social, as whether or not one has moral knowledge depends in part on the interests of others. In the end, the view I offer in these chapters presents a perhaps surprising picture of moral epistemology as systematically different from non-moral epistemology.In chapter 3 I investigate in more detail the social basis of moral knowledge by considering one particular view of the nature of moral facts, constructivism. According to this view, moral facts are determined by what would be the result of a hypothetical choice procedure amongst an idealized group of agents. Here I argue that the best moral epistemology on offer for the constructivist requires an agent to be able to respond to the objections that relevant others would have to the content of one’s belief in order for that belief to count as knowledge. In this way, moral knowledge for constructivists requires the ability to reason together with others about morality.After considering social constraints on moral knowledge, in chapter 4 I turn to consider whether normativity may likewise have a social basis. Here, I consider social-based views of normativity wherein an agent’s reasons for action are determined by the social institutions, practices, and relations (IPRs) she takes part in. I argue that existing views have trouble ensuring that certain intuitively bad social practices--namely, oppressive ones--aren’t a source of reasons. In light of this, I develop a novel positive view, Looping Social Constructivism, according to which an agent’s reasons are a function of the IPRs she takes part in, after they are idealized. Specifically, they are idealized such that each role in the IPR has the same ability to determine how rights, responsibilities, and power are distributed across the IPR. Looping Social Constructivism is able to avoid issues of oppressive IPRs given its unique use of idealization on the social level: instead of idealizing the individual agents taking part in an IPR, we idealize structural features of the IPR itself."
phi_etd_74,"Knowing How: An Empirical, Functionalist Approach",Philosophy,"Knowing-How, Knowing-That","Only very recently has the subject of knowledge how and its relation to propositional knowledge, or knowledge that, been given much attention by philosophers. In recent debates on the subject, positions tend to divide around the question: is knowledge how (KH) reducible to, or a kind of, knowledge that (KT), or are they fundamentally distinct categories of knowledge? I argue for the latter view, and I base my argument in the claim that KH and KT serve fundamentally different functional roles - specifically, KT is representational, while KH is practical. I develop my positive, functionalist account of KH in Chapter 6.Earlier chapters deal with background and methodological issues. In Chapter 1, I consider why philosophers, until recently, have tended to ignore the study of KH and have focused almost exclusively on KT. I argue that the omission is due to unexamined, tacit assumptions about the functional role knowledge should play. In Chapter 2, I argue for an empirical approach to the debate, and develop a folk theory of KH to use as a starting point for the investigation. In Chapters 3 and 4, I consider specific empirical domains - neuroscience and experimental psychology - and examine how they might inform the KH/KT debate. In Chapter 5, I critically consider an account of KH put forward by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson in a 2001 article, ""Knowing How,"" since it is the most prominent view opposed to my conclusion.Ultimately, I conclude that the preponderance of evidence supports the claim that the two kinds of knowledge are fundamentally distinct categories of knowledge, and that my functionalist account of KH provides the best explanation for this distinction."

This dissertation project inserts Latina activist Dolores Huerta into the feminist rhetorical tradition and traces the complicated ways in which ethos is constructed from multiply oppressed bodies within the context of social movements. Specifically, Huerta’s ethos formation is examined in order to identify the rhetorical strategies required when someone not only lacking power, but also purposefully silenced, is able to break through societal barriers and create change. The intent of this research is to build on the work of feminist rhetorical scholars and discover how attending to Huerta’s inescapable embodied identities provides a deeper conceptualization of rhetorical strategy. Through the rhetorical analysis of a variety of texts by, and about, Huerta I examine how she was positioned by others as well positions herself through language, and more specifically language that describes and/or defines her embodied identity categories.Ultimately, as a study of ethos and how it is affected by identity this dissertation project argues that the body and the embodied identities associated with it significantly shapes how ethos can and is constructed. In examining how social justice activist Dolores Huerta constructed her ethos during the initial organization of the United Farmworkers Union I aim to both highlight the role of Huerta as a co-founder of the UFW and add Huerta as an important rhetorical figure of study in the field of Rhetoric."

We seek to solve this problem without subjecting the growing culture to the risk of contamination afforded by physical sampling. The Binary Spectronephelometry (BSN) algorithm uses laser induced emission to probe mildly turbid media. A training set spanning the linear range of elastic emission (EE) i.e. physical scattering and inelastic emission (IE) i.e. fluorescence and Raman emission was produced with varying concentrations of bacteria and standard media using a modified commercial Raman spectrometer. The training set results confirmed the linear dependence of the EE and IE signals on the concentration of bacteria cells as determined by the known dilutions and the optical density at 600nm (OD600) thus confirming the basic assumptions of the algorithm and simultaneously calibrating the algorithm. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a bacterium capable of forming biofilms that allow survival in various conditions and transmittance from surfaces to person causing infection. PA cultures were monitored for several hours producing quantitative growth/decay curves for the bacteria concentration and the medium concentration. This was considered a challenging application of the algorithm because of the increase in viscosity and schlieren effects characteristic of PA with increasing culture time. Simultaneously obtained Raman spectra quantitatively demonstrate the conversion of feedstock i.e. glucose into product i.e. biomass in the form of bacterial membrane phospholipids, information concerning the chemical state of the medium and the organisms. We discuss these results in the context of various applications and future research and development."

Reactivity can differ significantly between aqueous and organic phases. We have measured photolysis kinetics of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) anthracene and pyrene in several organic solvents and in water, in miscible and phase-separated aqueous-organic mixtures, in the presence of halide salts (NaCl, NaBr, and NaI), and in simulated seawater. Moreover, the roles of singlet oxygen and pH were investigated on the kinetics at atmospherically-relevant wavelengths. Photolysis rate constants generally increased with increasing solvent polarity. Our results suggest that OM could greatly affect the photochemical lifetimes of PAHs in atmospheric condensed phases such as aerosols, even if the OM does not itself absorb photons. Our results also indicate that the fate of PAHs in saline waters, such as oceans and atmospheric particulate matter, could be significantly different than those predicted by kinetics measured in deionized water."
etd_195,Laboratory Studies of Gas-Grain Processes on Cosmic Dust Analogues,Physics,"cosmic dust, interstellar medium, oxygen, surface kinetics","The formation of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) takes place both in the gas phase and on surfaces of cosmic dust grains. Gas phase reactions alone are found to be insufficient to account for the observed abundance of molecules such as molecular hydrogen, water, carbon dioxide, methanol as well as many other complex molecules; grain surfaces must be involved as catalysts to explain their formation. In this thesis we study the physical and chemical processes on surfaces of cosmic dust grain analogues in simulated ISM environments. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe and is present in many astrobiologically important molecules. The desorption energy of atomic oxygen is a fundamental parameter that enters ISM models because it controls the residence time of this atom on a surface. However, it has not been measured in the laboratory. In this thesis, this parameter is measured by using both an indirect and a direct method. The measured value agrees with model predictions based on astronomical observations. The formation of two oxygen-containing molecules, water and hydroxylamine, is studied next. Water is the main component of ice mantles in dense clouds and is indispensable for the origin of life. Its formation via ozone hydrogenation on an analog of a warm dust grain is studied experimentally. The desorption energy of an important intermediate product in the reaction, the OH radical, is also inferred. Hydroxylamine is a precursor to the formation of glycine, which is the simplest amino acid. The formation of hydroxylamine via the oxidation of ammonia is studied by sequential deposition of ammonia and atomic oxygen and is followed by temperature programmed desorption experiments. The measured high reaction efficiency predicts that ammonia oxidation on grain surfaces could be an important route to hydroxylamine formation. The last chapter of this thesis introduces a rate equation model to simulate surface kinetics, including diffusion and desorption, of atoms and molecules on non-uniform surfaces."
etd_128,"Laboring Lesbians at Gas Stations: Pumping the ""Good Life""",Social Sciences,"emotional labor, gas stations, lesbians","This dissertation project is an interdisciplinary exploration of laboring lesbian bodies within the context of U.S. gas stations.  I begin with an investigation of the history of gas stations in connection with the oil industry and the company for which they work.  In addition, I examine how institutions of class, gender and sexuality are imprinted onto laboring lesbian bodies within the workplace.  I suggest that the work within U.S. gas stations is now primarily feminized labor as is typical of the service economy.  I also highlight the ways in which sexuality matters in the workplace through an analysis of the ways in which laboring lesbians perform emotional labor within this customer service environment.  Emotional labor is a seminal contribution to a feminist analysis of the sociology of work.  However, I am committed to complicating our understanding of emotional labor by attending more specifically to intersections of identity and geographical concepts of sexuality and space.  As I explore how emotional labor is impacted by who is performing what for whom and where, an interdisciplinary lens becomes critical.  To that end, I argue that the complexity of power is crucial to understanding the nuances of emotional labor through an intersectional analysis of class, gender and sexuality."
etd_182,Lacustrine Turbidites from Tropical African Lakes as Indicators of Hydrologic and Climatic Changes,Earth Sciences,"climatic change, droughts, floods, hydrologic change, tropical African lakes, turbidite","Flood-sourced turbidites (i.e. hyperpycnites) preserved in lake basins are proven indicators of hydrologic changes, yet their usefulness as recorders of tropical paleoclimate variability has long been overlooked. The primary focus of this dissertation research is to investigate the late Quaternary hydroclimatic changes in tropical Africa, using hyperpycnites, dated sediment cores, and high-resolution seismic reflection profiles from Lake Kivu in the East African Rift and Lake Bosumtwi in equatorial West Africa. A secondary focus of this dissertation is to image ancient turbidite systems of the Lake Albert rift in East Africa, using 2-D and 3-D seismic reflection data, and to assess the structural controls on turbidite sedimentation.Reoccurring megaturbidites (covering >200 km2) over the past ~12 k.y. were revealed by integrating seismic reflection data and sediment core results from Lake Kivu, which is subject to potential limnic overturns and degassing events. Sedimentological evidence and seismic and lake-floor bathymetric data suggest that the turbidites were sourced by hyperpycnal river flows during exceptional floods. Time series of turbidite bed-thickness and accumulation rate were generated and compared with regional paleohydrologic records of tropical East Africa, and it is found that the temporal occurrence of the turbidites is climatically controlled. It is also suggested that extreme floods in Lake Kivu's recent history may have triggered deep mixing events, and that potential geologic hazards associated with extraordinary turbidity currents may pose a risk to the current gas-extraction efforts in the lake.To further evaluate the effectiveness of lacustrine hyperpycnites as indicators of tropical African hydroclimatic changes, a 65 k.y. record of extreme hydrologic events in equatorial West Africa was reconstructed, using flood-sourced turbidites, seismic and sedimentological lake-level indicators, and paleohydrologic proxies, including total organic carbon and carbon isotopes, from the Lake Bosumtwi impact crater. Peak turbidite sedimentation is found to correlate with intervals of high TOC and markedly negative d13C values, suggesting that the turbidites were deposited during periods of high lake-levels. The multi-proxy paleohydrologic record from Lake Bosumtwi suggests that over the past 65 k.y., millennial-scale variability of hydrologic extremes in equatorial West Africa was linked to North Atlantic climate, with exceptional rainfall events linked to Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials and megadrought events associated with slowdowns of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation during Heinrich stadials.Finally, 2-D and 3-D seismic reflection data from the Lake Albert Rift were analyzed to assess turbidite sedimentology in tectonically active rift lakes. Large channelized turbidite systems were observed and characterized in 3-D seismic data using seismic attribute analyses. In the absence of sediment failures and related mass transport deposits from the seismic record, it is postulated that the turbidites were sourced by hyperpycnal river flows during floods, and that there was a change in the sediment source of the turbidites, caused by drainage reversals due to rift shoulder uplift. Sediment dispersal pathways, changes in depositional facies, and evolution of the sublacustrine turbidite systems are largely controlled by syndepositional tectonism in that system."
etd_679,Lagrangian Visualization and Real-Time Identification of the Vortex Shedding Time in the Wake of a Circular Cylinder,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"cylinder, fluid mechanics, FTLE, vortex","The flow around a circular cylinder, a canonical bluff body, has been extensively studied in the literature to determine the mechanisms that cause the formation of vortices in the cylinder wake. Understanding of these mechanisms has led to myriad attempts to control the vortices either to mitigate the oscillating forces they cause, or to augment them in order to enhance mixing in the near-wake. While these flow control techniques have been effective at low Reynolds numbers, they generally lose effectiveness or require excessive power at Reynolds numbers commonly experienced in practical applications. For this reason, new methods for identifying the locations of vortices and their shedding time could increase the effectiveness of the control techniques. In the current work, two-dimensional, two-component velocity data was collected in the wake of a circular cylinder using a planar digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) measurement system at Reynolds numbers of 9,000 and 19,000. This experimental data, as well as two-dimensional simulation data at a Reynolds number of 150, and three-dimensional simulation data at a Reynolds number of 400, is used to calculate the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field. The  locations of Lagrangian saddles, identified as non-parallel intersections of positive and negative time FTLE ridges, are shown to indicate the timing of von Kármán vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder. The Lagrangian saddle found upstream of a forming and subsequently shedding vortex is shown to clearly accelerate away from the cylinder surface as the vortex begins to shed. This provides a novel, objective method to determinethe timing of vortex shedding. The saddles are impossible to track in real-time, however, since future flow field data is needed for the computation of the FTLE fields. In order to detect the Lagrangian saddle acceleration without direct access to the FTLE, the saddle dynamics are connected to measurable surface quantities on a circular cylinder in crossflow. The acceleration of the Lagrangian saddle occurs simultaneously with a maximum in lift in both numerical cases, and with a minimum in the static pressure at a location slightly upstream of the mean separation location in the numerical cases, as well as the experimental data at a Reynolds number of 19,000. This allows the von Kármán vortex shedding time, determined objectively by the acceleration of the Lagrangian saddle away from the circular cylinder, to be detected by a minimum in the static pressure at one location on the cylinder, a quantity that can be measured in real-time using available pressure sensors. These results can be used to place sensors in optimal locations on bluff bodies to inform closed-loop flow control algorithms of the timing of von Kármán vortex shedding."
etd_186,Land use and land cover legacy effects on the mycorrhizosphere and productivity in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem,Biology,"Abundance, Land use, Mycorrhizal, Serengeti, Soil, Tanzania","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important microbial symbionts for plants especially when soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) are limiting, as AMF exchange nutrients gathered from soil for carbon compounds provided by plants. Although AMF have been extensively studied in temperate regions, the effects of land management and land cover changes on their abundance and their contributions to plant productivity in nutrient-poor tropical regions is still unclear. The research presented in this dissertation examined  the effects of AMF abundance and species composition on plant productivity in soils of a protected area (Serengeti National Park, Tanzania) grazed by wildlife, and open village lands either grazed by livestock or cultivated.The first study of 112 sampling sites across the Serengeti ecosystem showed lower AM hyphal density, a measure of abundance, in cultivated croplands and livestock-grazed areas compared to wildlife conservation areas. This result, which emerged after accounting for correlations between soil P, N, and pH on AM hyphal densities, supports the hypothesis that tillage associated with cultivation damages AMF hyphae and more intense grazing by livestock compared to wildlife in conservation areas may reduce carbon supply to AMF. A second study used remote-sensing data to determine land cover changes in the Serengeti region in the three types of land uses, and found that land cover history altered some soil physico-chemical properties. Conversion of grassland or woodland to cropland did not influence current AMF abundance in croplands. However, in livestock areas, current grasslands that were converted from woodland after 1984 had lower AMF abundance than areas maintained as grasslands. These differences were small compared to differences in AMF abundance among land use types, and  suggest that legacy of past land use has much weaker effects on AMF than current soil, disturbance and grazing conditions.A third study explored the influence of land use type on AMF spore abundance, biomass production, and species composition at 18 sites (n=6 per land use type). Wildlife grazed areas had nearly double the spore densities and hyphal production, as well as higher species diversity compared to livestock grazed and crop agriculture areas, which were similar. Species composition was also significantly different across the three land use types, with wildlife-grazed soils dominated by Glomus constrictum and Gigaspora spp., livestock grazed soils dominated by Acaulospora spp., and agricultural soils dominated by Glomus pellucida. The results suggest that the different land uses and their associated differences in disturbance, grazing intensity, dominant host plant species, and soil properties are associated with much greater differences in AMF species composition than in AMF abundance.Finally, in a fourth study, I conducted a factorial experiment to test the hypotheses that AMF were important contributors to plant productivity and that AMF contribution would be higher on soils with lower organic matter and presumably lower nutrient availability. Field soils from sites in each land use type that were either high or low in organic matter (OM) were each subjected to two soil microbial treatments: control, or no manipulation, versus sterilization to remove soil microbes, including successful elimination of mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots and thus AMF but also soil pathogens and nutrient mineralizing bacteria. These soils were mixed with sterile sand and used to fill 2 liter pots that were then planted with sanitized seeds of one of two graminoid species, Zea mays and Themeda triandra. The total above and belowground biomass of seedlings was measured after 3 months. Overall, production of both plant species was significantly higher on control soils than sterilized soils, indicating that AMF likely contributed significantly to productivity. Likewise, soils with higher OM yielded significantly higher production. However, the contribution to productivity by OM and soil microbes varied significantly among plant species and soils from different land uses. Soil sterilization reduced biomass production for Z. mays only on high OM livestock-grazed or agriculture soils and for T. triandra only on wildlife-grazed soils of either high or low OM. Sterilization increased production of Z. mays on agriculture soils, indicating the potential limitation of productivity by soil pathogens. The impact of sterilization likely reflected the abundance of beneficial AMF in particular soils, such as Gigaspora sp. for the grass T. triandra or Acaulospora for Z. mays and the likely soil pathogen load for Z. mays, which might be higher on agriculture soils and their associated tillage and fertilization. The impact of higher OM on productivity was consistently strong across soils from different land uses for Z. mays but only strong for T. triandra on wildlife-grazed soils. These results suggest that likely AMF impacts on productivity are driven more by mycorrhizal and host plant species composition than by potentially limiting nutrient supply. Furthermore, OM and AMF beneficial effects may combine in complex ways with potential soil pathogens to limit productivity in these generally nutrient-poor tropical soils. The influence of different land uses on productivity appeared to be driven more by differences in soil microbes and host plants rather than by OM, which suggests that efforts to enhance productivity in uncultivated lands should focus on altering plant species composition, while efforts to enhance productivity in agriculture soils might not depend on AMF but instead on effective crop rotations that reduces soil pathogens."
eng_etd_65,Landscaping India: From Colony to Postcolony,English,"Hegemony, India, Landscape, Nationalism, Scale, Space","Landscaping India investigates the use of landscapes in colonial and anti-colonial representations of India from the mid-nineteenth to the early-twentieth centuries. It examines literary and cultural texts in addition to, and along with, ""non-literary"" documents such as departmental and census reports published by the British Indian government, popular geography texts and text-books, travel guides, private journals, and newspaper reportage to develop a wider interpretative context for literary and cultural analysis of colonialism in South Asia. Drawing of materialist theorizations of ""landscape"" developed in the disciplines of geography, literary and cultural studies, and art history, Landscaping India examines the colonial landscape as a product of colonial hegemony, as well as a process of constructing, maintaining and challenging it. In so doing, it illuminates the conditions of possibility for, and the historico-geographical processes that structure, the production of the Indian nation.The dissertation begins by examining the concept of the nation in spatial-temporal terms, and as imbricated in the uneven and global processes of capitalism. The next two chapters examine the deployment of landscape in British and Indian literary and cultural productions at two specific local sites. The second chapter focuses on British and Indian contestation of the landscape of the colonial city of Calcutta, the capital of British Indian space. The third chapter focuses on the British claims and Indian counter-claims over the Himalayan landscape. Both chapters demonstrate how the Indians counter the British landscaping of these sites to produce their own counter-conceptions. In other words, it shows how Indians appropriate for themselves the landscapes of Calcutta and the Himalaya.The fourth chapter examines the idealization and idolization of the Indian landscape in Vande Mataram (1882), the national song of the post-colonial Indian nation-state, and its role in structuring the idea of India as a motherland. I argue that while the song's anti-colonial spatial imagination is inspired by the quotidian reality of British India ravaged by famines, its reliance on a pastoral ethos and Hindu ""commonsense"" also posits the laboring classes and Muslims as outsiders to India, in addition to gesturing towards a patriarchal and hetero-normative national ethos. The fifth and final chapter examines the nation as a scalar manifestation of the landscape form, and explores the contending conceptions of the Indian nation-space, and Indians, in Rudyard Kipling's Kim (1901) and Rabindranath Tagore's Gora (1907). It investigates how these novels address the questions of belonging to India, and ""Indian-ness,"" by interrogating, in particular, the novels' depictions of their Irish foundling protagonists. The chapter contends that Tagore's idea of the nation as a universal space of humanity repudiates Kipling's imperialist vision of India as a space of irredeemable difference, and highlights how Tagore's articulation of ""India"" and ""the Indian,"" provides a dissenting perspective from contemporaneous trends in anti-colonial nationalism that assumed a decidedly Hindu tenor. The chapter also highlights how Tagore, by focusing on the scale of the home, and the inequitable gendered division of labor within it, critiques Indian nationalists for their refusal to incorporate a critique of gender inequality and patriarchy within the framework of national liberation."
etd_295,Language Abstractness as Discursive Microframes: LCM Framing in American Coverage of International News,Media Studies,"International News, Journalism, Linguistic Category Model, News Frames, Stereotypes, U.S. News Media","The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether articles covering countries with different levels of proximity and relations to the U.S. would be framed differently in American news media. In particular, this study employs the Linguistic Category Model, a tool for measuring language abstractness.This study incorporates scholarship from mass communication, international relations and linguistics. The literature review discusses international news coverage by American reporters and journalists; past scholarship examining linguistics in news text, including linguistic relativity theory and critical discourse analysis; and framing literature, focusing specifically on the framing building process and international news frames. After, the Linguistic Category Model is introduced, which is used to code for language abstractness.Two constructed weeks of news, encompassing a sample size of 960, were coded for their LCM frame and most important country discussed. Seven proximity and interaction country characteristics were applied to each article based on most important country discussed: distance, trade flow, language, military aid, regime type, development and conflict. The LCM frame was the dependent variable, while the country characteristics were the independent variable.Results show that the variables regime type, development and conflict were most related to changes in the LCM frame. While increased polity and development decreased language abstractness, increased conflict increased language abstractness. One interaction (conflict + development) included in the model was also influenced LCM frame. Implications of this are discussed, and the LCM frame is identified as a discursive microframe."
psc_etd_109,Lawyers Need Law: A Study of Constitutional Arguments Made to State Supreme Courts,Political Science,"onal law, judicial federalism, lawyers, state constitutional law, state courts, support structure","Dismayed over the increasing conservatism of the U.S. Supreme Court, state judges, lawyers, and scholars in the 1970s argued for a new judicial federalism. State courts, using state constitutions, may provide protections exceeding the federal minimum. In addition to allowing states to experiment with solutions to rights disputes, and recognizing unique state traditions, judicial federalism had instrumental value in ensuring state level protections that were protected from review at the federal level. While supporters saw judicial federalism as a means of realizing the principle of dual constitutional rights protection through principled development of a body of state law, the reality proved to fall short of these hopes. Rights issues in state courts still focus heavily upon federal law with limited development of state constitutional law. Explanations for the limited development of judicial federalism have tended to focus on the court centric explanations of judicial ideology, separation of powers, and state political environment.This dissertation examines the limited development from another angle by examining the support structure for state constitutional activism. Courts rely upon lawyers to develop claims for courts to act upon, and the strength of this structure helps explain how state courts have dealt with state constitutional activism. Courts, however, are not powerless to influence the content of the arguments presented by lawyers. Through their opinions, courts send signals and give guidance about the kinds of claims it wishes to hear. Given that lawyers are conditioned to think of rights issues in federal terms only, the support structure should generally be fairly anemic with lawyers focusing on federal law primarily. However, two kinds of signals can alter this behavior. First, the federal retrenchment signal occurs when the U.S. Supreme Court overrules or narrows a rights doctrine, and where it refuses to recognize new rights claims. Second, the internal encouragement signal occurs when a state high court embraces state law either in the form of a particular doctrine or a broader theory of state constitutional law. Under either of these signals, lawyers should turn to state law providing state courts with a stronger support structure for state constitutional law.This dissertation explores these questions through an examination of legal arguments presented to four state high courts (New York, Ohio, Oregon, Washington) and a set of remand arguments in 14 states from the 1970s to 2000. Three principle findings are identified. First, the support structure is normally quite weak. Absent signals from either state or federal courts, litigants rely upon the federal law they have been taught when dealing with rights issues with virtually no attention to state law. Second, federal retrenchment does lead to more state constitutional arguments but in a limited manner. Lawyers tend to give limited attention to the traditional legal arguments in favor of attacking the policy choices involved in the U.S. Supreme Court's retrenchment in an attempt to convince the state court to simply evade this change by applying the previous federal rule under the dressing of state law. Third, state court encouragement also leads to greater attention to state constitutional arguments but without the same focus on policy concerns. Instead, lawyers tend to abandon concern for shifts in federal law in favor of the legal factors and arguments taken from the guidance of the state high court. In addition to adding to our knowledge of the reasons for the limited development of judicial federalism, this research adds to our understanding of the interactions between lawyers and courts in the development of legal doctrine."
etd_185,Leaders' Accounts: A Study of Transnational NGOs Leadership Views on Accountability,Political Science,"Accountability, International, Leadership, Non-Governmental Organizations, Nonprofit, Transnational","The increased involvement of non-state actors such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in The increased involvement of non-state actors such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in shaping various national and global policy processes raises serious questions about the accountability, authority, and legitimacy of these important yet unelected actors. Although there is no consensus on how to define accountability, broadly the concept refers to the idea that some hold others responsible for their actions according to a set of standards defining proper behavior. However, deciding to whom and to what standards NGOs are accountable and how they are (or should be) held accountable remain central and open questions in accountability debates.This study relies on both qualitative and quantitative methods, introducing the use of qualitative pattern analysis to understand not only what leaders of TNGOs have to say about accountability, but also how they describe their accountability experiences. It uses the TNGO initiative datasets, which include in-depth interview data for 152 CEOs of U.S.- registered TNGOs, as well as secondary data collected for each of the organizations in the sample. Drawing from the nonprofit, management, and international relations scholarship, I explore the three central questions of accountability debates: What is accountability? Accountable to whom? And how? I argue that once one addresses each of these accountability questions, taking an actor-centered perspective, it is possible to understand how accountability practices vary across transnational NGOs.I propose the concept of accountability dissonance to explain the disconnect between the three main questions of accountability. Through the empirical chapters, I show that TNGO leaders expressed often complex views about their accountability experiences, yet they generally struggled to communicate their practices. I stress the need to pay attention to the substantive meaning of accountability messaging and to the connections among definitions, audiences, and responses. The phenomenon of accountability dissonance persists because leaders express their accountability using tools and processes that are mismatched to their definitions and audiences. Furthermore, the data suggest that the types of organizations TNGO leaders manage matter in very different ways, contingent on the aspect of accountability being considered. To reach a holistic understanding, I propose an overarching framework using the analogy of the puzzle to highlight the need for a more integrated approach to TNGO accountability, one hinging on the ability to target the communication of accountability performance to specific audiences."
etd_406,LEADING CURRICULAR CHANGE: THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Common Core State Standards, instructional leadership, rigor, school culture, standards-based reform","Principals, whose jobs are increasingly being reframed as requiring instructional leadership (Lunenburg, 2013; Hallinger, 2005), serve as a vital link between standards-based reform and its successful implementation at the school level (Fullan, 2011; Hallinger & Heck, 1996; Leithwood & Riehl, 2005; Spillane & Hunt, 2010). Standards-based reform or guidelines for change mandated by state government significantly influence teaching and learning (Beane, 2013). Our nation’s latest iteration of standards-based reform is comprised within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), which are currently fully implemented in 42 states. Despite the essential role of the school leader in implementation of standards-based reform, research is limited on how principals understand their role, and how these understandings play out in practice. The goal of this research was to address this research gap and directly explore how principals perceive their role in facilitating implementation of the CCSS.Based upon sensemaking theory, as explained by Coburn and Talbert (2006) and activity theory, as explained by Engestrom (1999), Nardi (1996), and Spillane, Halverson and Diamond (2004), this study explores how individuals make meaning of information and/or events from interacting within their school environment. Through semi-structured interviews with (current and past) elementary school principals leading nationally recognized, Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence and document analysis of demographic data, this study makes sense of how instructional leaders negotiate and facilitate mandated change.Findings illuminated school culture and reflective practice of school leaders as important factors influencing implementation. Participants also identified three factors, from their perspectives, in successful change: the cultivation of strong sustained school culture oriented toward continual improvement and student achievement, the strategic development within the school culture of authentic relationships and trustworthy leadership, and the establishment of shared decision-making and distribution of leadership within the school environment. Participants described the role of the instructional leader as one of support and service, explained the challenges they faced in the implementation of the CCSS, and revealed the emotional work associated with their reflective practice. Findings are relevant to training of instructional leaders and serve to inform future research involving the ways principals interact with curriculum and instruction as it relates to standards-based reform."
etd_315,Leading Edge Embedded Fan Airfoil Concept - New Powered High Lift Technology,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"cross-flow fan, ESTOL, general aviation aircraft, powered high lift airfoil","A new powered-lift airfoil concept called Leading Edge Embedded Fan (LEEF) is proposed for Extremely Short Take-Off and Landing (ESTOL)  and Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) applications. The LEEF airfoil concept is a powered-lift airfoil concept capable of generating thrust and very high lift-coefficient at extreme angles-of attack (AoA). It is designed to activate only at the take-off and landing phases, similar to conventional flaps or slats, allowing the aircraft to operate efficiently at cruise in its conventional configuration.The LEEF concept consists of placing a crossflow fan (CFF) along the leading-edge (LE) of the wing, and the housing is designed to alter the airfoil shape between take-off/landing and cruise configurations with ease. The unique rectangular cross section of the crossflow fan allows for its ease of integration into a conventional subsonic wing. This technology is developed for ESTOL aircraft applications and is most effectively applied to General Aviation (GA) aircraft. Another potential area of application for LEEF is tiltrotor aircraft. Unlike existing powered high-lift systems, the LEEF airfoil uses a local high-pressure air source from cross-flow fans, does not require ducting, and is able to be deployed using distributed electric power systems throughout the wing. In addition to distributed lift augmentation, the LEEF system can provide additional thrust during takeoff and landing operation to supplement the primary cruise propulsion system.Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of a conventional airfoil/wing using the NACA 63-3-418 section, commonly used in GA, and a LEEF airfoil/wing embedded into the same airfoil section were carried out to evaluate the advantages of and the costs associated with implementing the LEEF concept. Computational results show that significant lift and augmented thrust are available during LEEF operation while requiring only moderate fan power input. The CFD results show that airfoil circulation control is achieved by the varying the CFF intake flow rate and the momentum of the CFF exhaust jet (e.g. through airfoil AoA or fan rotational speed). The presence of the CFF has the effect of moving the stagnation point on the airfoil pressure surface from the CFF airfoil LE region near the CFF to as far back as the airfoil trailing edge. At high AoA operation, LE flow separation on the airfoil suction surface is delayed by flow entrainment of the high-energy jet leaving the CFF. Detailed analysis of the flow field through the crossflow fan and its housing were carried out to understand its fluid-dynamics behavior, and it is found that the airfoil geometry acts as inlet guide vanes to the crossflow fan as the angle-of-attack is varied, thus introducing pre-swirl or co-swirl into the first stage of the crossflow fan. An experimental study of the LEEF concept confirmed that the concept works and it is robust. Finally, as application examples, the LEEF technology is applied to a Remote Control model and to a generic tiltrotor aircraft similar in characteristics to DARPA's Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System. These aircraft configurations were analyzed using 2D and 3D CFD."
etd_233,Leading Teacher Unions: Negotiating Challenges and Impact,Sociology,teacher union,"Given tremendous challenges, how do union leaders - in their role as advocates for public servants - maintain union viability under systems of control, and within the gendered context of public school workplaces? I study union leadership during a particularly hostile moment for public employee unions and public school teachers. According to the US Department of Labor (2014), union membership nationally is 11%, and declining, suggesting the influence of unions is also diminishing over time. The weakened viability of unions is inversely associated with a growing corporate culture that seeks to restrain workers' rights and privileges by asserting their economic and political influence over unions and the workers they represent.I offer an in-depth perspective of union leaders from a single teacher union as they manage union strategies during a particularly hostile moment for teachers and their unions. I used a longitudinal case study framework to explore the strategies and everyday work of union leaders as they manage union activities for one teacher union in a northeast US city I refer to as Urban, NY. Using symbolic interactionism and feminist methods to study the experiences of union leaders, I approached the lives and experiences of leaders as central to this story of union viability, while also making my own social location as the researcher an essential part of the text. From September 2006 to February 2011, I conducted interviews with key informants who discussed at length their experiences as union leaders, and I participated in union meetings and events to witness how union work was accomplished. I observed union leaders managing the union mostly at monthly representative assembly meetings, and also at town hall meetings, rallies, and social and community events.Union leaders must manage the internal workings of the union while simultaneously negotiating teachers' professional authority as they interact with external entities, including the federal government, state legislators, school administrators, and the community. I address the role of union leaders as advocates for public servants by focusing first on the typical expectations for any teacher union president and Executive Board; second on the specific experiences of three Urban City Union (UCU) presidents who presided over the union during a particularly challenging moment for public school teachers; and, third on the leadership qualities well-suited for union presidents, based on a review of literature and corroborated by my research.Union leaders negotiated the use of intimidation by district administrators to control teacher behavior at the local level. Union leaders negotiated the use of mandates by policy makers to control the teaching profession at a macro level, as well. Specifically, union leaders described the impact accountability mandates had on teachers' relationships with students and parents and the unintended consequences of standardization on curriculum quality.I address the role of union leaders as advocates for constituents in a gendered occupation comprised predominately of women workers by drawing first on the feminist critiques of gender inequality associated with workplace practices; and second, on the specific experiences of three UCU women leaders who describe how sexism at work was a catalyst for participation in leadership. I selected these three stories because they offer composite pictures of some issues women respondents spoke about in terms of workplace sexism and taking on the challenge of a leadership position. I reflect on leaders' stories of balancing home-life with work and union commitments to provide insight into how a union organization can do more for working families."
etd_124,"LEARNING BY DESIGN: TECHNOLOGY PREPARATION FOR ""DIGITAL NATIVE"" PRESERVICE TEACHERS","Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","digital native, Learning By Design, modeling, preservice teacher technology preparation, reflection, TPACK","Effective technology integration in teaching requires teachers to construct technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). To help teachers develop TPACK, the learning environment must address the situated nature and complex interplay of technology, pedagogy and content. Learning By design (LBD) has been proposed as one promising instructional model to create such a learning environment. To explore effective and theory-grounded technology instruction for digital native preservice teachers, an LBD environment was designed, developed and implemented in a technology integration course for preservice teachers. Using design-based research methodologies, this dissertation research study is intended to explore whether LBD is effective in helping digital native preservice teachers develop TPACK, how LBD takes effects, and what improvement can be made to the learning environment.This dissertation is in multi-paper format and consists of four individual papers. Each paper focuses on one aspect of the research study. In paper #1 (Chapter 1), Learning by Design: Technology Preparation for Digital Native Preservice Teachers, the researcher describes the research purposes, the theoretical framework and instructional design model behind the courses, and the application of LBD in a technology integration course for preservice teachers. In addition, as the first paper in this multi-paper dissertation, the researcher also introduces the research design and methods of the study.In paper #2 (Chapter 2), Learning By Design for Preservice Teacher Technology Preparation: How Effective Is It and in What Ways, the researcher examined whether an LBD environment is effective in helping preservice teachers develop TPACK, and described how the participants perceived the effectiveness of LBD. The results indicated that LBD can be an effective instructional theory in designing learning environments to facilitate preservice teachers' TPACK development. The participants generally agreed that LBD was helpful for them to learn about teaching with technology. They felt more comfortable with and confident in using technology in their teaching. Recommendations are made for future research and practices.In paper #3 (Chapter 3), Using Live Dual Modeling to Help Preservice Teachers Develop TPACK, the researcher investigated whether a Live Dual Modeling strategy in the LBD environment was effective in helping preservice teachers develop TPACK and what conditions influenced the use of this strategy. The findings showed that preservice teachers demonstrated the initial ability to transfer what they learned in the modeling to real-world classroom teaching. When Live Dual Modeling is used, attention should be paid to the conditions that influence the effectiveness of the strategy due to preservice teachers' limitations in their overall knowledge base, practical experience, and ability to transfer learning to other contexts.Paper #4 (Chapter 4), Cultivating Reflective Practitioners in Technology Preparation: Constructing TPACK through Reflection, investigated the participants' TPACK development as manifested in their reflection journals and how reflection helped preservice teachers construct TPACK. Through content analysis of the participants' reflection journals, the researcher found that the preservice teachers constructed their initial TPACK awareness. However, their TPACK development was incomplete and superficial. Interviews with the participants showed that reflection helped them describe and elaborate on their technology integration experience, be more confident in their ability to use technology for teaching, and be more reflective and open-minded about using technology in classrooms. Finally, the researcher discussed this study's implications for teacher educators and researchers."
etd_402,Learning by Game Design for Library Instruction: A Multiple Case Study,School of Information Studies,"Experiential Learning, Game design, Higher Education, Information Literacy, Self determination theory, Social Constructivism","Despite the importance placed on information literacy in fostering lifelong learning, helping students develop the skills required of critical thinkers and independent learners are limited. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on alternative instructional approaches to teaching information literacy and focuses on the use of game design in learning environments.The appeal of gaming among the younger generation of learners has led to the increasing use of games in learning environments. Within recent years, some innovative academic libraries have begun adopting games as a platform for information literacy instruction. While the literature recognizes game design as fostering higher-level learning in educational contexts, it is not commonly adopted in the classroom. Typically, there is a preference among instructors to have students play games.  Therefore, a more thorough understanding on the ways game design best facilitate learning is needed to assist towards its more frequent adoption. This study focuses on the use of game design within library spaces.The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of undergraduate students learning by game design in information literacy classes. The overarching research question looks at how an instructor can incorporate motivational theories into an information literacy class through learning by game design and how students engage with the content and each other in this environment. More specific supporting questions address: How can an instructor incorporate motivational theories into an information literacy class through “learning by game design”? How does the “learning by game design” approach within information literacy classes foster the sharing of knowledge among undergraduate students? How do undergraduate students represent information literacy concepts in the game-based artifacts they design?  What were undergraduate students’ motivations to use information literacy practices they were exposed to throughout their class experiences?Applying a descriptive multi-site case study methodology, this study draws upon the theories of social constructivism, experiential learning, and motivation to explore the phenomenon of learning by game design in information literacy classes. Data was collected from two sites using various methods to provide a comprehensive view of the phenomenon. Data sources included: student's artifacts, submitted class assessment materials, recorded observation, participant observation, items from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) and interviews. Analysis was done by drawing meanings across the multiple instances of data.Findings from this study show that learning by game design is a viable option for teaching information literacy classes, when effectively scaffolded into the classroom. Students were able to draw upon a higher order of cognition and described situated instances where information literacy skills were applied, such as use in complex assignments and real world situations."
idde_etd_55,Learning Disabilities and the Virtual College Campus: A Grounded Theory of Accessibility,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Accessibility, College students, Learning dissabilities, Web-based services","Two trends currently impacting higher education intersect in this study: (1) students with learning disabilities are enrolling in colleges and universities in increasing numbers, and (2) colleges and universities are increasingly relying on the web to provide services to students. This reliance on the ""virtual campus"" comes without apparent consideration of accessibility issues that may be experienced by students with learning disabilities. This study explored the experiences of 16 college students, self-identified as having learning disabilities, as they interacted with the virtual campus of one college.Consistent with the social model of disability, this study initially focused on the features of the virtual campus that were both helpful and not helpful to the informants as they performed eight tasks considered typical of those expected of a college student. Using a grounded theory methodology, the model that evolved from this data indicated that to understand the informants' experiences, consideration had to be given also to what the informants brought to the experience, including their active choice and use of helpful strategies.The results of this study suggest that web accessibility as currently conceived is too limiting. A ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to universal access is unrealistic as users of the virtual campus bring varied strengths and capabilities as well as varied impairments to their interaction with web-based services. While colleges and universities are encouraged to follow current usability and accessibility principles, attention should also be given to the construction of a web-human interface that can be individualized to meet a user's specific needs."
cfe_etd_52,Learning Lessons and Being Schooled: The Relational Lessons of Young Women in an Alternative High School,Cultural Foundations of Education,"Alternative High School, At-Risk Dropout, Diverse, Environmental Conservation Education, Foucault, Girls","This dissertation is a qualitative investigation of 12 female high school graduates who had previously dropped out or were pushed out of public high school and who attended and graduated from ""Conservation High School"" (CHS), located in the Pacific Northwest. CHS is an alternative high school organized around an environmental conservation theme. In this study, participants describe how their relationships with peers and teachers in each school affected their commitment to finish school. I analyze participants' awareness of how power dynamics were communicated to students through social organization, school practices, meaning making systems, constructions of identity, and others' behavior. The youth interacted with peers and teachers based on their perceptions of their place in the social order of the school, reinforced by hearing such terms as ""at-risk,"" ""dropouts,"" ""behaviorally-disordered,"" and ""special education."" I used Foucault's concept of the self as a product of the disciplinary power of discourse to frame the study of these youth's experience of being socially and therefore relationally positioned, a phenomenon I named ""relational regulation.""In Chapter 4 participants describe how institutionalized practices, such as the management of school space, time, and organization, and informal regulations, such as emotional expression and bodily representations, were managed in their relationships in school. Participants describe the relational possibilities they experienced at CHS in comparison to their public school experiences. Themes were developed from their narratives, including ""getting to know you,"" ""being at each other's throats,"" and ""schooling effects."" In Chapter 5, I consider how participants use the discourses of ""being fake"" and ""being real"" to inform themselves about the relational terrain. ""Being fake"" is their term for a deceptive representation of self, while ""being real"" is their term for an honest one. I show how they use these discourses to resist and also reproduce some of the exclusionary politics they rejected in their public school that were central to their leaving school. In Chapter 6, I look at how the students negotiated the dominant discourse of ""hygienic"" femininity, while doing conservation work in the muddy outdoors. Last, I address why relational regulation matters and discuss implications for future research."
idde_etd_56,Learning through Games: Essential Features of an Educational Game,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Challenge, Educational Games, Fantasy, Feedback, Pretest Posttest, Quantitative","This study investigated the following research questions: (1) Do instructional games augment learning? (2) What is the impact of the challenge and fantasy features in instructional games on learning? For the purpose of this study, a game called ""Humatan"" was designed to teach human anatomy to high school students based on the Baltimore County Public Schools curriculum. Four different versions of the Humatan game were created:1. A game with only the challenge feature turned on2. A game with only the fantasy feature turned on3. A game with both the challenge and fantasy features turned on4. A game with challenge and fantasy turned offHigh school students from Baltimore County Public Schools (n=202) were randomly assigned to play one of the above four versions of the Humatan game after taking a pretest on human anatomy. After playing the game, they also took a posttest and a survey to obtain information related to their Grade Point Average (GPA), Socioeconomic Status (SES), game skillfulness, gender, and the ethnicity. Since there were no existing survey instruments available for measuring game skillfulness, the researcher created a new survey instrument which was validated by the Survey Research Laboratory in the University of Illinois at Chicago. All the four groups showed an improvement in learning, which suggests that instructional games augment learning. Students who played the game version with only the challenge feature turned on (n=48) scored a higher average gain score than the students who played other variations of the game. Analysis of variance showed a main effect of challenge on the gain score, F (3, 198) = 4.71, p = .003. Students who played with only the fantasy feature turned on (n=52) obtained the lowest average gain score. This implies that the challenge feature significantly improved learning and the fantasy feature did not significantly improve learning. The GPA, SES, game skillfulness, gender, and the ethnicity of the students did not show any significant impact on learning."
etd_133,Life Events and Alcohol Use Disorder Clinical Course: Modeling the Dynamic Association,Psychology,"Alcohol use, Clinical course, Cross-validation, Life events, Structural equation modeling","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) continues to be a public health concern in the United States. The study of determinants of AUD's clinical course has received substantial empirical attention, with the goal of informing theory and clinical interventions. The dynamic model of relapse has been particularly influential in this regard. The occurrence of life events (LEs) is one hypothesized determinant of poor AUD treatment outcome within the dynamic model, such that proximal LEs and alcohol use have a reciprocal influence on each other in the context of distal LEs. However, despite over 35 years of study, the LEs- AUD treatment outcome relationship lacks consistent empirical support, which may be due to a lack of theoretically driven designs and corresponding statistical analyses. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the LEs-outcome relationship by statistically modeling the dynamic relationship between negative LEs and alcohol use post-treatment, as it is conceptualized within the dynamic model. Existing longitudinal data from 563 AUD treatment-seeking adults were randomly assigned to two samples. One sample (N = 282) was used to estimate a series of dynamic bivariate latent change score models that differentially relate latent indicators of distal and proximal LEs and alcohol use across 12 months. It was hypothesized that the model in which proximal LEs predict increases in alcohol use, and alcohol use predicts subsequent changes in proximal LEs across time will provide the best fit to the data, providing support for the LEs-outcome relationship as it is described in the dynamic model of relapse. Analyses were cross-validated on the second sample (N = 281) in order to determine the stability of findings. Results partially supported the hypotheses, such that the hypothesized model for each of the alcohol use outcomes (i.e., frequency, intensity, and heavy drinking) provided the best fit to the data, and these models were cross-validated. Proximal LEs were significantly associated with subsequent increases in heavy drinking, though heavy drinking was not a determinant of change in LEs. The bidirectional associations between LEs and alcohol use frequency and intensity were not statistically significant, suggesting that the models may have been underspecified. Additionally, more negative distal LEs were found to be associated with a greater increase in LEs, but not alcohol use, over the subsequent 12 months. Implications of these findings and future directions for research are discussed."

This historical study of the Syracuse Writing Program's administrative structures for contingent faculty focuses on professional development and evaluation systems for the Writing Program's part-time writing instructors. The study draws on archival methodology, using saved administrative documents from the Syracuse Writing Program and retrospective interviews of past members of the Syracuse University Writing Program. This history is influenced and contextualized through scholarship on contingent faculty labor, writing program administration, and the establishment of stand-alone writing programs. The goal of this history of the Syracuse Writing Program is to study the long-term effects of professional development and evaluation systems on writing teachers' development and the growth of a teaching culture marked by shared values about writing and pedagogy within a writing program. This history argues that ongoing reflective professional development and evaluation systems are necessary for all teachers of writing, both new and experienced practitioners."

After the Immigration Act of 1990, many of them have become visible experts in science and engineering. Yet their struggles as Chinese academic migrants simultaneously privileged by their educational backgrounds and disadvantaged by their outsider status in the U.S. often remain invisible. Possibly due to the myth of “model minority,” mainstream America has seen them as doing-well and well-behaving, and scholarship in gender studies, Asian-American studies, science and technology studies, and (sub)urban studies has barely acknowledged this group. This dissertation documents how a group of Chinese academic migrants engage with everyday struggles around their paradoxical (im)migrant statuses through participation in a weekend Chinese language school. The title of this dissertation speaks to how this group, while appearing peaceful and at ease on the surface, is actually paddling non-stop underneath.  Through individual and communal bootstrapping, they manage to survive harsh disciplining mechanisms such as an often-excruciating immigration policy and the tricky discourses of multiculturalism.  My data analysis draws upon diverse fields including education, sociology, philosophy, cultural geography, Asian-American studies, gender studies, migration and globalization studies. What is also interesting about this research is that it focuses on Chinese schools (instead of Chinatowns) as significant institutions that mediate this group’s migration experience."
phy_etd_126,Linear Sigma Models in QCD and S3 Symmetry for Neutrinos,Physics,Particle physics,"This thesis has two parts with different topics in particle physics. In part I, we consider various linear sigma models and their applications to scalar mesons. It is shown that the tree amplitude for ?? scattering in the minimal linear sigma model has an exact expression which induces an infinite geometric series in which the pattern for both the I = 0 and I = 2 s-wave scattering lengths to orders $p^2$, $p^4$ and $p^6$ seems to agree with chiral perturbation theory predictions. The model is then gauged to study the mass differences between the vector meson and the axial vector meson as a possibly useful ""template"" for the role of a light scalar in QCD as well as for (at a different scale) an effective Higgs sector for some recently proposed walking technicolor models. The model is applied to the s-wave pion-pion scattering in QCD. Both the near threshold region and (with an assumed unitarization) the ""global"" region up to about 800 MeV are considered. It is noted that there is a little tension between the choice of ""bare"" sigma mass parameter for describing these two regions.By including the parity reversed partner we study a simple two Higgs dou-blet model which reflects, in a phenomenological way, the idea of compositeness for the Higgs sector. It is relatively predictive. In one scenario, it allows for a ""hidden"" usual Higgs particle in the 100 GeV region and a possible dark matter candidate.Poles in unitarized [pi pi] scattering amplitude are studied in a generalized linear sigma model which contains two scalar nonets (one of quark-antiquark type and the other of diquark-antidiquark type) and two corresponding pseu- doscalar nonets. It is shown that a reasonable agreement with experimental data is obtained up to about 1 GeV. Some comparison is made to the situation in the usual SU(3) linear sigma model with a single scalar nonet.We show that the mixing of two ""bare"" nonets, one of which is of quark- antiquark type and the other of two quark- two antiquark type is, before chiral symmetry breaking terms are included, only possible for three flavors. Specif ically, our criterion would lead one to believe that scalar and pseudoscalar states containing charm would not have ""four quark"" admixtures. We also discuss some aspects associated with the possibility of getting new experi- mental information about scalars from semileptonic decays of heavy charged mesons into an isosinglet scalar or pseudoscalar plus leptons.In part II we explore a predictive model based on permutation symmetry S3 for the masses and mixing matrix of three Majorana neutrinos. At zeroth order the model yielded degenerate neutrinos and a generalized ""tribimaximal"" mixing matrix. We first study the effects of the perturbation which violates S3 but preserves the well known (23) interchange symmetry. This is done in the presence of an arbitrary Majorana phase ? which serves to insure the degeneracy of the three neutrinos at the unperturbed level. At this order the mass splitting was incorporated and the tribimaximal mixing matrix emerged with very small corrections but with a zero value for the parameter s13. Next a different, assumed weaker, perturbation is included which gives a non zero value for s13 and further corrections to other quantities. These corrections are worked out and their consequences discussed under the simplifying assumption that the conventional CP violation phase vanishes. It is shown that the existing measurements of the parameter s23 provide strong bounds on s13 in this model."
etd_355,Link Prediction in Dynamic Weighted and Directed Social Network using Supervised Learning,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Data Mining, Link Prediction, Machine Learning, Social Network","Link Prediction is an area of great interest in social network analy- sis. Previous works in the area of link prediction have only focused on networks where the links once created cannot be removed. In many real world social networks, the links should be assigned strengths; for example, the strength of a link should decrease over time, if there are no interactions between the two nodes for a long time and increase if the two nodes interact often. In this thesis we modify existing meth- ods of link prediction to apply to weighted and directed networks. The features, developed in previous works for unweighted and undi- rected networks, are extended to apply to networks whose links have weight and direction, and algorithms are developed to calculate them efficiently. These network features are used to train an SVM clas- sifier to predict which nodes will be connected by a link and which links will be broken in the future. The results obtained using Twitter @-mention network demonstrate that the method developed in this thesis is very effective."
etd_743,Linking descriptive assessment to functional analysis and treatment of transition-related problem behavior,Psychology,"functional behavior assessment, problem behavior, transitions","Activity transitions are difficult for many children with developmental disabilities, leading to problem behavior and decreased instructional time in schools. Assessing the function of transition-related problem behavior, especially in the school setting, requires special attention. Functional analysis methodology has been employed and can demonstrate functional relations. However, functional analyses may not always capture the naturally occurring contingencies or detect idiosyncratic variables. Thus, the current study examined the concurrent validity and treatment utility of assessing transition-related problem behavior descriptively. Two boys with autism (8 and 11-years-old) and one boy with Down syndrome (6-years-old) participated. All sessions were conducted at an outpatient behavior analysis clinic. Descriptive assessments occurred during natural transitions with caregivers and results were used to design functional analysis test conditions that mimicked the components of the natural transitions. Based on the outcomes from the descriptive assessments and functional analyses, function-matched interventions were developed and evaluated in a reversal deign for each child. Treatment consisted of signaling reinforcement in the post-transition activity and differentially reinforcing independent transitions in the absence of problem behavior. In general, outcomes from the functional analyses confirmed that the variables identified in the descriptive assessment were functionally related to each child’s problem behavior. Additionally, function-matched interventions were effective at reducing problem behavior for all children. The benefits of assessing transition-related problem behavior both descriptively and experimentally are discussed.Keywords: transitions, problem behavior, functional behavior assessment"

Two hundred-twenty eight (228) undergraduate students along with their mothers (n=212) and fathers (n=156) participated in this study. Students reported on their attachment characteristics with their fathers, mothers and close peers. Fathers and mothers reported on their perceptions of the quality of parenting received from their father within the family of origin, perceptions of their parenting behaviors and levels of depressive symptomology. Path analysis was used to test mediation models for fathers and mothers. The models tested: (a) the strength and nature of the direct relationship between parent's developmental history and peer relatedness in emerging adulthood , (b) the strength and nature of the indirect relationship between parents developmental history and emerging adult social peer relatedness through parental depression and parenting behaviors (warmth/acceptance vs. rejection/hostility), and parent- emerging adult attachment quality. Path analyses found direct relationships between mothers' developmental history and peer relatedness and indirect relationships between mothers' depression, parenting and emerging adult attachment but no significant relationship between emerging adult-mother attachment and peer relatedness. Indirect relationships were found between fathers' developmental history, depression, parenting, emerging adult attachment and peer relatedness and no direct relationship between fathers' developmental history and peer relatedness. The findings are discussed in the context of differential and/or separate influences of mothers' and fathers' on peer relatedness in late adolescence/ emerging adulthood."

The existence of these maps is related to the smoothness of the norm of the space and isomorphic invariants called type and cotype will play a central role as well. The main result will be answering a question asked by W.B. Johnson about the isomorphic classification of Hilbert spaces.Next we will find bounds on the distortion of subsets of infinite dimensional Hilbert space. This concept compares the extrinsic straight line distance inherited from the underlying space to the path metric of a subset. We will then use this concept to glean insight into the surjectivity of Bilipschitz maps.The tight span of a finite metric space is a polyhedral complex embedded in a normed space. We will show that  the position and lengths of the vertices and edges that arise in this construction are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the underlying space X.We will study symmetric products, where it is an open problem whether the symmetric product of a space X inherits the property of being an absolute Lipschitz retract. We will propose an approach that utilizes tight spans toward answering this question."
etd_682,"Literacy and Labor: Archives, Networks, and Histories in Working-Class Communities",Writing Program,"adult education, community literacy, composition, labor, working-class, writing studies","Literacy and Labor: Archives, Networks, and Histories in Working-Class Communities explores the significance of The Federation of Worker Writers and Community Publishers (FWWCP), a network of writing groups that existed between 1976-2007 and self-published thousands of texts focused on working-class life, immigrant experience, and educational development. The FWWCP emerged in London and eventually spread throughout the United Kingdom and, then, transnationally. Circulating close to one million chapbooks, this network represents years of social history, testimony, and cultural conditions described through the voices of working-class people. I begin by unpacking the historical and social conditions of the FWWCP’s tenure and explain how the FWWCP challenges conventional understandings of literacy, publics, and histories held within the field of Writing Studies to include working-class examples from alternative educational sites. As a methodological response to the field, I describe a how a team of scholars, librarians, and FWWCP members collaborated to build print and digital archives of the FWWCP. Drawing from these archives, I illustrate how the FWWCP —as a group and individual members— negotiated their own expansion in connection to identity politics. Through organizational documents, I trace key moments concerning how the group could maintain a working-class ethos within a changing political landscape of multiculturalism. Moving from a discussion of the national organization to a local example, I focus on one member-group, Pecket Well College, which created a new educational model run by and for adults with difficulties in reading and writing. Lastly, discusses the exigency for digital preservation along with the material constraints of such work, arguing for a new model of collaborative digital archival building. Ultimately, then, this dissertation examines self-sponsored writing, in order to show how communities expand our understanding of literacy and writing beyond traditional educational spaces. I argue that such a focus demonstrates multiple types of literacies beyond what we study and presents how working-class communities generate and perform rhetorical acts—acts that can show us what grassroots community organizing looks like, how community-led teaching functions, and why self-generated and sustained community work matters."
bio_etd_88,Local adaptation to climate change in a calcareous grassland system,Biology,"Adaptation, Climate change, Functional traits, Plantago lanceolata, Plant communities, Population genetics","Annual manipulations of temperature and rainfall have been maintained in intact calcareous grassland since 1993 at the Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL) in northern England (UK). Here I investigated the role of local adaptation as mechanism of the apparent resistance of species' to long-term climate manipulations at BCCIL using a common forb, Plantago lanceolata. Plantago lanceolata is a rosette-forming, perennial herb of wide-ranging distribution, and one of the more common forbs in calcareous grasslands, including BCCIL. In the first study I used a common garden approach to test for evidence of selection for different suites of functional traits in P. lanceolata populations exposed to chronic summer drought at BCCIL. Results suggest that avoidance strategies associated with high reproductive allocation were more common in populations exposed to long term experimental drought versus populations from controls and that soil depth moderated treatment effects. In the second study I revealed significant treatment based genetic differentiation in P. lanceolata populations using molecular markers (AFLPs: Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms) that suggests a genetic basis for the functional differentiation evident in the common garden study. Finally I expanded environmental monitoring and trait analyses of P. lanceolata to calcareous grassland systems in the landscape surrounding BCCIL in an effort to relate the extent and spatial structure of nested landscape gradients corresponding to soil water supply and demand and the spatial structure of variation in six functional traits that reflect the main axes of functional differentiation found in the common garden study. Abiotic gradients associated with soil water dynamics had distinct spatial structures which in turn promoted the hierarchical partitioning of intraspecific functional diversity in five of the six functional traits measured. Taken together my results suggest a genetic basis for local intraspecific functional differentiation in P. lanceolata which in turn has allowed this species to adapt in situ to experimental climate manipulations. Furthermore, local and landscape scale gradients in factors related to climate change (e.g., soil moisture) promote functional trait variation at associated scales which may buffer this species from future climatic change."
etd_638,Local Investment and the Relationship Between Prices and Earnings,Accounting,"Local Bias, Prices and Earnings","This paper examines how local stock ownership influences the relationship between stock prices and future earnings. Prior finance literature has found that local investment leads to superior returns and has suggested that these returns are a result of an informational edge for those who invest locally. However, the literature has yet to examine which types of information local investors have access to and how that impacts the informativeness of stock prices. This paper shows that local investors have access to earnings-relevant information which results in stock prices which better lead future earnings for companies with larger local ownership bases. This phenomenon is more pronounced for companies headquartered away from institutional investors, where local investors are better able to drive the stock price. In addition, I find local investors have been more influential in pricing future earnings in local stocks in recent years as online and individual stock trading has allowed more local information to get priced. Overall, these results indicate that due to their physical closeness local investors are better able to anticipate future earnings than the investing public and can lead to more informative stock prices."

Wound dressings are designed to fulfill such demands. In addition, wound dressings protect wounds from subsequent physical harm and bacterial infection. Among various types of wound dressings, electrospun wound dressings are widely marketed due to desired properties. For instance, electrospun polymers are highly porous. Water and oxygen that are necessary for cells are permeable through the porous structure. Moreover, electrospun polymers have high surface area to volume ratio. This property allows polymers to absorb extra exudate from wounds efficiently.  In this study, several silver-releasing electrospun polymers were evaluated with respect to their inhibiting activities against bacterial biofilms. Additionally, cadmium sulfide quantum dots were used as fluorescence probes to measure the silver release of several silver-containing polymers."
etd_247,Looking Beyond the Standard Model from the Lattice,Physics,,"The overall motivation behind the work undertaken in this thesis, is to gain a deeper insight into the dynamics responsible for the Higgs mechanism.  In particular we use lattice gauge theory techniques, to understand the inherent symmetry breaking patterns of three specific BSM (beyond the standard model) theories. The first model (in chapter 3) describes the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern in a two dimensional, eight supercharge supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We discuss the mechanism responsible for the said symmetry breaking and show evidence for a possible light Goldstino-the fermionic analogue of a massless goldstone boson. In chapter 4, we study the phase structure of the gauged NJL model on the lattice to verify continuum calculations that predict a possible second order phase transition corresponding to a line of new fixed points. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we find that, this model does not exhibit a second order phase transition and instead the influence of the four fermi term results in a dramatic enhancement of the chiral condensate signal. Finally, in chapter 5, we show that a strongly coupled theory comprising just of fermions and gauge fields displays dynamical gauge symmetry breaking due to the formation of a gauge invariant four-fermion condensate."

The Secular Canons of San Giorgio in Alga, led by men who would go on to hold the highest positions in the church, molded many of Giustiniani’s views on the church and determined his career path throughout his life. In 1433, he was promoted to the Venetian episcopacy because he represented and exemplified the secular canons’ ideals and mission. In 1451, Pope Nicholas V abolished the patriarchate of Grado and the bishopric of Castello (Venice) and created the patriarchate of Venice. Nicholas named Giustiniani the first Patriarch of Venice. Giustiniani adhered to the tenets of the devotio moderna religious movement that stressed individual devotion and focused on Eucharistic piety; consequently, he not only lived his life, but also ran the diocese and later the patriarchate according to the devotio moderna model. He proved his commitment and allegiance to the secular canons, Venice, the church, and God by practicing time and time again the virtues of obedience and humility. Yet, during a time when Venice and the papacy were frequently at odds, Giustiniani saw no contradiction in his obedience to both."

Functional limitations lead to clinical mobility disability. Clinical mobility disability is associated with physical dependence, poor quality of life, and mortality. Treatment of age-related clinical mobility disability should focus on the prevention of the condition rather than its consequences. Identifying opportunities for early screening and prevention of clinical mobility disability requires a better understanding of the functional loss prior to this medical condition.Aims: The global aim of this dissertation was to examine if measures of leg strength are clinically relevant bio-markers of daily task modifications among community dwelling older adults living independently."
ant_etd_100,"Making a Living at Making a Difference: A Study of Employees in Nonprofit Social Service Organizations in Memphis, Tennessee",Anthropology,"Care Labor, Class, Gender, Nonprofits, Race, United States","As one of the largest and fastest growing sectors of the U.S. economy, nonprofits provide critical services for vulnerable populations in the wake of the rapidly retreating welfare state. Often cast as havens for selfless and resilient employees, nonprofits offer unique rewards such as a sense of fulfillment, the gratification of making a difference, and a flexible work schedule that presumably buffer the stresses of the work. These rewards, however, are offset by salaries below the median income, limited opportunities for career advancement, and a paucity of benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans. Stridently enforced anti-discrimination policies and procedures that protect employees and promote equality on the job can be absent in the nonprofit setting. Further, the nonprofit labor process co-opts ideologies of race, gender, and class, which produces familiar-sounding discourses about inequality. Though high rates of staff turnover and other indicators of employee unhappiness are widely recognized, nonprofit employees remain remarkably unstudied from a labor perspective. Set in Memphis, Tennessee, this project examines working conditions for a stratified group of employees in social service nonprofits. With a few potent exceptions, employees most often encounter legal, structural, and cultural conditions that either counteract grievances or otherwise prevent them from taking action to change working conditions."
etd_143,"Making Fenians: The Transnational Constitutive Rhetoric of Revolutionary Irish Nationalism, 1858-1876",Writing Program,"constitutive rhetoric, Fenian, Fenian Brotherhood, Irish nationalism, rhetorical history, sovereignty","This dissertation traces the constitutive rhetorical strategies of revolutionary Irish nationalists operating transnationally from 1858-1876. Collectively known as the Fenians, they consisted of the Irish Republican Brotherhood in the United Kingdom and the Fenian Brotherhood in North America. Conceptually grounded in the main schools of Burkean constitutive rhetoric, it examines public and private letters, speeches, Constitutions, Convention Proceedings, published propaganda, and newspaper arguments of the Fenian counterpublic. It argues two main points. First, the separate national constraints imposed by England and the United States necessitated discursive and non-discursive rhetorical responses in each locale that made it near impossible to sustain transnational consubstantiality for the movement. Second, North American Fenian strategies to gain sovereign recognition for Ireland relied on and helped to further substantiate the palliative Constitutional wishes of equality that undergirded the racial and settler inequalities of the United States. After establishing the exigency and framework for the project, Chapter 2 examines the transnational attempts by Fenian leadership to constitute the ""Irish nation"" in the diaspora across existing national borders. It argues that, despite the shared vision and motives, the separate national constraints negotiated by each arm of the movement made it impossible to maintain a shared strategy for achieving Irish freedom. Chapter 3 then focuses on the Constitutions created by the North American organization in order to constitute Irish sovereignty, demonstrating how the scenic conditions wrought by these Constitutional enactments contributed to a legitimacy crisis that led to the schism in the Fenian Brotherhood and paved the way for multiple failed invasions of Canada. Chapter 4 examines the constitutive rhetorical strategies of The Fenians' Progress, a propaganda tract used by the wing that sought to invade Canada, and limns the rhetorics of respectability this faction employed as they appealed to the U.S. for recognition of Fenian belligerent status. Chapter 5 juxtaposes the rhetorics of ""skirmishing"" and ""settling"" in The Irish World in the mid-1870s in the wake of the failed Canadian invasions, tracing the rhetorics of settler solidarity these otherwise anti-imperialist Irish-Americans invoke in print. It concludes by discussing the Fenian case's implications for rhetorical theory."
etd_479,Making Math Risky: A Translational Study on Preference for Mixed- Versus Fixed-Ratio Schedules during Problem Completion,Psychology,"Math Problem Completion, Ratio Schedules, Risky Choice","Basic research has demonstrated that when given a choice between a reinforcement schedule that requires a fixed number of responses or one that requires a mixed number of responses, preference typically emerges for the mixed option even when it requires a larger response requirement.  The current study attempted to replicate and extend these findings to math problem completion by fourth-grade students. Across 5 phases, 4 students chose either to complete 5 addition problems per trial (fixed-ratio schedule) or a mixed number of addition problems per trial (mixed-ratio schedule). The first mixed schedule examined required either 1 or 9 problems per trial.  The number of math problems in the mixed schedule was increased by 20% (1 or 11 problems per trial) in the subsequent phase. The third phase featured a mixed schedule requiring 5 or 7 problems per trial. This was followed by a reversal to the preceding phase in which preference for the mixed schedule had been observed and a final reversal back to the phase featuring a mixed schedule requiring 5 or 7 problems per trial.  Findings were consistent with previous research in that preference emerged for the mixed schedules that required only 1 problem on some trials, but did not when the mixed option required 5 or 7 problems.  Results highlight the importance of small work requirements in the emergence of preference for mixed schedules and offer implications for future studies aimed at encouraging students to choose lengthier assignments."
etd_520,Making Men in the City: Articulating Masculinity and Space in Urban India,Anthropology,"Caste, Masculinity, South Asia, Urban space","In my dissertation, I illustrate the way in which processes in contemporary urban India structure the making/ unmaking of gendered identities for young men in a working class, scheduled caste neighborhood in the western Indian city of Pune. Present day Pune, an aspiring metropolis, presents a complex socio-spatial intersection of neoliberal processes and peculiar historical trajectories of caste exclusion; this dissertation seeks to highlight how socio-spatial dynamics of the city produce and sustain gendered identities and inequalities in Pune, a city hitherto neglected in academic research. Also, my focus on young men’s gendered identities speaks to a growing recognition that men need to be studied in gendered terms, as ‘men,’ in order to understand fully the dimensions of gendered inequalities and violence prevalent in South Asian cities today. I follow the lives of young men between 16 and 30 in a neighborhood in the eastern part of Pune, who belong to a scheduled caste called Matang. The historical incorporation of this caste group as municipal sweepers in the city’s labour regime has had adverse implications for the young men, in terms of low levels of education and precarious chances of employment in an increasingly skill-based and informalized labor market. I explore ethnographically the deep sense of gendered inadequacy that this lack generates in the young men, articulated in explicitly spatialised terms: through the continuous dismissal by the young men of their neighborhood as ‘backward’ as opposed to the middle class ‘standard’ areas in the city; and through their aspirational struggles to master the new spaces of consumption in the city.Relevant to my dissertation are the practices of local, exclusively male voluntary associations and of local electoral politics, which I argue constitute distinct subcultures shaped by and embedded in the historical, socio-political and spatial organisation of the city. I demonstrate in ethnographic terms how the membership of the neighborhood voluntary association and its activities enables the enactment of a ‘moral masculinity’ for the young men in the neighborhood, while simultaneously equipping them with the tools to acquire specialised knowledge about the informal, criminal city, itself a highly gendered terrain. The young men’s participation in local political brokering is an expression of the peculiar culture of urban local politics that incorporated poor neighborhoods as vital nodes of populist political bargaining in post-colonial urban India. I show how the spatialized nature of these processes allow the young men temporary feelings of power and self-worth during these negotiations, thus constituting a sense of self which tightly binds location/ place with caste, class and a gendered identity. I also illustrate the role that women’s evaluations and expectations play in shaping the gendered identities of men in the galli.I conclude that the construction and enactment of gendered identities of young men in the neighborhood is intimately moulded by their multiple marginalisations from the city’s economic, social and democratic political processes, a historical trajectory intensified in the city’s current neoliberal ethos. At the same time, the possibilities of recuperating this gendered sense of inadequacy in the spaces of the neighborhood also ensures their being trapped in these very spaces, further entrenching them firmly in the geography of the city’s caste and class based exclusion."
etd_103,Making Sense of Autism: Parents' Experiences in the People's Republic of China,Teaching and Leadership,"autism, China, constructionist, disability studies, parents, qualitative","In this qualitative study, I explore the experiences of parents of children with autism in China. I investigate how the parents negotiate their day-to-day life of raising a child with autism in contemporary urban Chinese society. I also examine the socially constructed nature of autism within this specific social and cultural context and how the constructed meaning of autism is reflected in the way that parents perceive, treat, and educate their children with the autism label.Participants were volunteers recruited from a group of parents of children with autism who attended an educational program offered by Sunshine Autism Institute (SAI), which is located in a small village on the eastern outskirts of a metropolitan city of China. In-depth interviews and participant observations were used to collect rich, detailed, descriptive data in naturalistic settings.The findings suggest that in a society where the medical-model discourse of disability is the conventional and dominant form of thinking, autism is perceived as a disease that needs to be ""cured."" Moreover, children with the autism label generally do not have the opportunity to attend public schools and are usually rejected by mainstream society. However, some parents came to see their children with autism beyond the confinement of medical description. They recognized their children as having their own characteristics, strengths, interests, and needs. They valued their children's individuality, affirmed their competence. In these families, autistic ways of being were respected and embraced. Findings also show how when acknowledged as complete and full persons, children with the autism label can be: included as full participants in family life; enabled by being presumed competent; and, mainstreamed into classrooms with other children when appropriate accommodations are provided."
etd_348,Marginalization and Democracy: Kenya's 2007 Post Election Violence,African American Studies,"Class Relations, Democratization, Ethnic politicization, Kenya, Marginalization, Post-Election Violence","Until recently, Kenya was considered an icon, a bastion of political stability and economic growth in East Africa and Africa in general.  Forty-four years after gaining independence, and fifteen years since the beginning of multiparty democracy, the ruling elite touted this exceptionalism to conceal the historical grievances of marginalized communities. Given this background, the electoral violence experienced between December 2007 and March 2008 came as a surprise to many. Much scholarship on the topic focuses on the immediate triggers such as voting irregularities rather than the underlying conditions that existed prior to the violence. In this study, I attempt to identify the root causes of the electoral violence in Kenya by focusing on two main areas of historical marginalization: class and ethnic marginalization. The Kenyan crisis helps show some lessons for pan-African world."
etd_450,Marronage Unbound: Colonial Governance and Maroon Resistance to Enslavement in the French Caribbean,Geography,,"This dissertation examines the relationship between practices of marronage—escape from enslavement and revolt against colonial power—and European governance strategies. It focuses primarily on France’s colonial territories in the Caribbean at the turn of the 19th century, a tumultuous period that witnessed the advent of both the French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution. My overarching argument in this dissertation is that marronage figured more centrally in the construction of colonial space during this period than scholars typically assume. To make this argument, I draw on materials gathered from archives in Louisiana and France, including correspondence between colonial administrators, court documents, military reports, and militia memoranda. I study these archival materials and use GIS techniques to map and explain how practitioners of marronage, or “maroons,” impacted French attempts at securing territorial control in the Americas during the late 1700s and early 1800s. I also explain how maroons created new spaces of freedom and independence in the French Caribbean, focusing on four primary sites: Louisiana, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, and Saint-Domingue / Haiti. At each location, I show how maroon resistance was ubiquitous in colonial landscapes and intimately tied to popular rebellions against European authority. This framing of marronage is crucial, I contend, for intervening in historical debates which tend to underestimate its role in shaping the trajectory of French colonialism at the turn of the 19th century. It is also crucial for understanding how historical struggles between maroons and European officials matter today and continue to inform strategies of flight and rebellion that still have the potential to create liberated spaces throughout the Caribbean and across the Americas more generally."
phi_etd_72,Meaningful Experiences: An Essay on Experiences of Understanding,Philosophy,"cognition, conscious experience, understanding","This dissertation is about one contested case in debates about what types of conscious experience we token. It is about so-called experiences of understanding. I develop answers to some basic questions about this contested case: What is it to say that we have experiences of understanding? Are we justified in believing that some people sometimes have such experiences? When do people have such experiences, if they have them at all? Why is it philosophically significant whether we have such experiences?In Chapter 1 I start from the two thought experiments - coined, separately, by Galen Strawson and Christopher Peacocke- that instigated debates about experiences of understanding. The idea that guides the first half of the chapter is that the first thing we ought to get clear on in these debates is what philosophers are affirming or denying when they take a stand on whether people really have experiences of understanding. I address this issue by developing a largely new conceptual grounding for the debate. In the second half of the chapter I shift from clarifying to arguing for a position in the literature. I argue for what I call Realism about experiences of understanding.In Chapter 2 I address three problems that remain for Realism about experiences of understanding after the preceding chapter. The first problem is to show how Realism can cope with a version of the vacuity problem for ceteris paribus generalizations that it faces. The second problem is to get clearer on Realism's commitments about mental events of understanding. The third problem is to work through what Realism says about several types of cases that differ in interesting ways from the exemplar Strawson-Peacocke thought experiments.In Chapter 3 I look at the implications of Realism about experiences of understanding for debates about cognitive experiences. Roughly put, debates about cognitive experiences concern whether we have any experiences that are neither sensory nor emotional experiences. I argue that Realism undermines three theses put forward recently as ways to deny that there is any robust sense in which we have cognitive experiences. I also draw some positive morals from Realism undermining these theses. I show that Realism implies we have cognitive experiences, on a robust way of parsing out what is sufficient for having cognitive experiences."

This measurement can help physicists understand some peculiarities in the Standard Model, which is the fundamental framework of knowledge of the universe. Should this asymmetry diverge from zero, new physics may be a main motivator. Using 1 fb-1 of collected data in 2011 with proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, the measured value of assl presented is (-0.06 ± 0.50 ± 0.36)%, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.

It is performed with a sample of Lb semileptonic decays in proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 3 fb-??1. The semileptonic decays Lb->LcMuNuX are identied bythe detection of a muon and a Lc baryon decaying to pKpi. The decay Lb->LcPiPiMuNu is used to isolate the semileptonic decay Lb->LcMuNu??, and determine the spectrum dN/dw(Lb->LcMuNu), where w is the inner product of the 4-velocities of the the initial and nal state heavy baryons. The slope and curvature of the Isgur-Wise function have been determined with a variety of shape assumptions. The measured values are consistent with sum rules bounds. Finally, the shape of the spectrum dN/dq2 has been studied and compared with recent lattice QCD predictions."

It employs its two cilia, identified as cis and trans with respect to its photoreceptor-containing eye, to achieve appropriate behavioral responses. The sensory signals are relayed to the dynein motors in the cilia through complex networks of signal transduction pathways that have yet to be fully characterized. The first part of this work is an experimental study of one such signal transduction pathways, the membrane electric field. In the study, an experimental method is developed to monitor the membrane electric field transients in response to an external stimulus. The method is non-invasive and allows monitoring the membrane electric field of cell population over extended periods of time by using a voltage-sensitive fluorescence probe, di-8-ANNEPS. The method is also insensitive to cell orientations and is suitable for studying the effect of any stimuli that may influence the behavior of cells by changing the membrane electric field. In this work two such types of stimuli, green light and sound, are used. In response to impulses of green light, the membrane electric field was found to change in the same way for both positively and negatively phototactic strains, and all the processing due to green light detection at the eye appeared to take place in the cilia. In response to sound stimuli, amplitude-modulated as 1-second-on-1-second-off or sine waves at 8.0 Hz, no change in the membrane electric field was observed.The second part of this work is devoted to tracking experiments of swimming Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. The measured cell trajectories are quantified using a suitable implementation of the cell-motility model developed in the third part of this work. Through quantifying the cell trajectories using the motility model, the activity of IC138 component of cilium's inner I1/f-dynein arm is characterized. This unit has a regulatory role in motility. When it is phosphorylated (due to increased level of cAMP), the probability of it acting like a transient brake or an extra drag on the trans-cilium increases. This in turn causes a low-amplitude extra beat relative to the cis-cilium that maintains a steady beat. The extra low amplitude beat causes the cell to change direction more frequently, which makes the motion less ballistic and more diffusive. This ballistic-diffusive ratio affects the behavior associated with mating and searching for food and light in opposing manners. More frequent activation of the brake, for example, worsens search for food and light but increases chances of mating. In order to quantify this regulatory mechanism, which is a part of the braking signal transduction network, individual tracks of six Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains were recorded and the data was fit to the above mentioned motility model at the population level. Among the obtained set of statistical parameters from fitting, the persistence time was found to be the most suitable one for characterizing the activity of IC138.In addition to this, a special realization of the cell-motility model, suitable for studying the effect of an external periodic force on motility, is also developed in the third part of this work. This realization provides a quantitative mean to discern between the pure mechanical effect of an external periodic force, such as sound, and its sensory detection on the cell behavior."

It is located in a tunnel with a circumference of 27 kilometers (17 miles) whose synchrotron is designed to mainly collide opposing particle beams of protons with energy up to 7 TeV in 2011 and 8 TeV in 2012. LHC is designed to address some of the fundamental open questions in physics regarding the basic laws governing the interactions and forces among the elementary particles. Among the four major experiments at LHC: A Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS), Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) and A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE), LHCb is the one that is specialized on heavy flavor physics whose goal is to measure the Charge Parity Violation (CPV) parameters and rare decays of the Beauty and Charm hadrons. Such studies can help to explain the Matter-Antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.     CP violation searches are performed at LHCb in quite a few probing decay channels and systems. In $B_{s}^{0}$-$\bar{B_{s}^{0}}$ mixing, the CP violation is expected to be tiny in the Standard Model, but can be significantly enhanced in the presence of new CP violation phases in general physics models. This thesis presents, in Chapter 5, the measurement of semileptonic asymmetry $a_{\text{sl}}^{\text{s}}$ in $\Bs$-$\Bsb$ mixing system at LHCb. The CP-violating asymmetry $a_{\text{sl}}^{\text{s}}$ is studied using samples of $\Bs$ and $\Bsb$ semileptonic decays in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb-1 collected by LHCb. The detected final states are $\Dspm\mu ^{\mp}$, with the $\Dspm$ particle reconstructed in the $\phi\pipm$ mode. The $\Dspm\mu ^{\mp}$ yields are summed over untagged $\Bsb$ and $\Bs$ initial states, and integrated with respect to decay time. Data-driven methods are used to measure all the efficiency ratios needed to determine $a_{\text{sl}}^{\text{s}}$ . We obtain $a_{\text{sl}}^{\text{s}}$ = $(-0.06\pm0.50\pm0.36)$\%, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. Specific attention is drawn to an elegant data-driven approach that is developed to determine the relative pion detection efficiency as described in Chapter 3. It is a key building block of the $a_{\text{sl}}^{\text{s}}$ measurement and can open many other doors to CPV<\italic> searches at LHCb. As a ``litmus test"" for this tool, we measure the $D_{s}^{+}$ -- $D_{s}^{-}$ production asymmetry using $\phi\pipm$ mode in 7 TeV pp collisions at LHC in Chapter 4. Heavy quark production in 7 TeV center-of-mass energy of pp collisions at the LHC is not necessarily flavor symmetric. The production asymmetry, $A_{\rm P}$, between $D_s^+$ and $D_s^-$ mesons is studied using the $\phi\pi^{\pm}$ decay mode in a data sample of 1.0 fb-1 collected with the LHCb detector. The difference between $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ detection efficiencies is determined using the ratios of fully reconstructed to partially reconstructed $\Dstarpm$ decays. The overall production asymmetry in the $D_s^{\pm}$ rapidity region 2.0 to 4.5 with transverse momentum larger than 2 GeV is measured to be $A_{\rm P}=(-0.33\pm0.22 \pm0.10)$\%. While theoretical predictions are difficult and vague, a precise measure of the production asymmetry constrains future heavy quark models and can be used as inputs for other CPV measurements"
etd_347,Mechanically Active Electrospun Materials,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Active Materials, Composites, Electrospinning, Origami, Shape Memory Polymers","Electrospinning, a technique used to fabricate small diameter polymer fibers, has been employed to develop unique, active materials falling under two categories: (1) shape memory elastomeric composites (SMECs) and (2) water responsive fiber mats.  (1) Previous work has characterized in detail the properties and behavior of traditional SMECs with isotropic fibers embedded in an elastomer matrix. The current work has two goals: (i) characterize laminated anisotropic SMECs and (ii) develop a fabrication process that is scalable for commercial SMEC manufacturing.  The former ((i)) requires electrospinning aligned polymer fibers.  The aligned fibers are similarly embedded in an elastomer matrix and stacked at various fiber orientations.  The resulting laminated composite has a unique response to tensile deformation: after stretching and releasing, the composite curls.  This curling response was characterized based on fiber orientation.  The latter goal ((ii)) required use of a dual-electrospinning process to simultaneously electrospin two polymers.  This fabrication approach incorporated only industrially relevant processing techniques, enabling the possibility of commercial application of a shape memory rubber.  Furthermore, the approach had the added benefit of increased control over composition and material properties.  (2) The strong elongational forces experienced by polymer chains during the electrospinning process induce molecular alignment along the length of electrospun fibers.  Such orientation is maintained in the fibers as the polymer vitrifies.  Consequently, residual stress is stored in electrospun fiber mats and can be recovered by heating through the polymer's glass transition temperature.  Alternatively, the glass transition temperature can be depressed by introducing a plasticizing agent.  Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) is plasticized by water, and its glass transition temperature is lowered below room temperature.  Therefore, the residual stress can be relaxed at room temperature simply by hydrating the PVAc fibers.  This work investigated the response of PVAc to the application of water on one surface.  More specifically, the folding of films of PVAc fibrous webs in response to water lines drawn locally on the mat surface was quantified and characterized based on fiber mat characteristics."
etd_224,"MECHANICALLY ASSISTED CORROSION PERFORMANCE OF METALLIC BIOMATERIALS: IMPLANT RETRIEVAL, MATERIAL ANALYSES AND DEVICE TESTING",Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Crevice Corrosion, Fretting corrosion, Hip Implants, Mechanically Assisted Corrosion, Spinal Implants","Mechanically assisted corrosion (MAC) of metallic biomaterials continues to be a concern for highly-loaded medical devices for spinal, dental, cardiovascular and orthopedic applications. Increasing usage of modularity (multiple-component system) and mixed-alloy metal-metal junctions in orthopedic surgery gives the surgeon increased intraoperative flexibility for choosing optimal components; however, these design changes can accelerate corrosion reactions and significantly impact local biological processes and mechanical integrity of the implants. In order to successfully decrease the potential for premature failure of metallic implants, MAC performance of metallic biomaterials (stainless steel, titanium and cobalt chromium alloy) needs to be investigated and understood.First, a failure analysis was performed on a retrieved Ti6Al4V neck-stem modular taper which was implanted for 6 years. A new unreported mechanism of in vivo corrosion (oxide induced stress corrosion cracking (OISCC)) which led to the failure of neck-stem taper was proposed. The results showed large penetrating pitting attack where pits ultimately developed into cracks and the cracks propagated due to stresses developed by oxide growth within the crack geometry (seemingly independent of externally applied stresses).Second, instrumented pin-on-disk fretting corrosion tests were conducted to investigate the effect of mechanical (load, frequency) and electrochemical (potential) factors on fretting corrosion performance of 6 alloy couples made from 316L Stainless Steel (ASTM F138), Titanium alloy-Ti6Al4V ELI (ASTM F136) and Cobalt Chromium alloy-CoCrMo (ASTM F1537). A new theoretical model was also developed to predict voltage excursions typically seen during MAC processes. The results of this study showed that fretting corrosion is affected by alloy combination, normal load, potential and motion conditions at the fretting interfaces. In particular, Ti6Al4V_Ti6Al4V couples exhibited the highest fretting currents, COF and voltage excursions compared to other alloy couples. SS316L containing couples showed the highest susceptibility to fretting-initiated crevice corrosion attack compared to couples of CoCrMo and Ti6Al4V alloy. The developed model was capable of predicting the voltage excursions for all alloy couples tested.Third, a new performance test method was developed to study the effect of mixing stainless steel, titanium and cobalt chromium alloy components (17 alloy combinations) on fretting corrosion response of spinal screw and rod implants (assembled using ASTM F1717). The hypothesis was assessed as to whether mixed-alloy combinations are different in terms of fretting corrosion behavior than similar-alloy combinations for the same design under similar test conditions. All Ti6Al4V constructs showed the best response (lowest fretting currents) while stainless steel containing constructs were more prone to fretting-initiated crevice corrosion attack and showed severe pitting in SEM analysis. There were no obvious galvanic-based acceleration of corrosion reactions in these tests.Lastly, a new test protocol and a custom-built test set-up was developed for evaluation of modular hip tapers in terms of electrochemical (fretting corrosion) and mechanical (micromotions) response. A strong correlation between measured corrosion currents and micromotions were seen. This test method can be used to evaluate performance of modular implants for multiple factors including different taper geometries, taper lengths, materials, assembly load and other conditions to assess relative effects of fretting corrosion."
etd_337,"Mechanics, shape, and programmability in soft matter systems: From fluid membranes to spring and droplet networks",Physics,"droplet networks, mechanics, membranes, programmability, shape, soft matter","This thesis analyzes three different soft matter systems---membranes, polymers, and droplets---to answer questions about shape, mechanics, and programmability.For membranes, my collaborators and I have developed a theoretical model of endocytosis in yeast. Endocytosis is the process by which a cell membrane deforms to surround extracellular material to draw it into the cell. Endocytosis in yeast involves clathrin, actin, and Bar proteins. Our model breaks up the process into three stages: (i) initiation, where clathrin interacts with the cell membrane via adaptor proteins, (ii) elongation, where the membrane is then further deformed by polymerizing actin filaments, followed by (iii) pinch-off. Our results suggest that the pinch-off mechanism may be assisted by a pearling-like instability. In addition, we potentially rule out two of the three competing models for the organization of the actin filament network during the elongation stage.  For polymers, the actin cytoskeleton network at the leading edge of the cell becomes anisotropic with filament alignment favoring the direction of motion of the cell. To begin to capture the mechanics of this anisotropic filament network, my collaborators and I have constructed an effective medium (mean field) theory of an anisotropic, disordered spring network.  We find that increasing the anisotropy increases the filament density required for a nonzero shear modulus (rigidity). We also conduct numerical simulations and find good agreement with the effective medium theory. We then extend our analysis to include the mechanics of coupled disordered spring networks to study force transmission between the actin cytoskeletal network and DNA via the lamin filament network and potentially begin to establish a microscopic basis for the mechanical regulation of transcription via the actin cytoskeleton. For droplets, we study numerically a collection of aqueous droplets joined by single lipid bilayers to form a cohesive, tissue-like material. The droplets in these droplet networks can be programmed with different osmolarity gradients. These osmolarity gradients generate internal stresses via local flows and the network then folds into designed structures. In other words, global change is driven by local osmolarity gradients. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the formation of shapes ranging from rings to spirals to tetrahedra and determining the optimal range of parameters for such structures. By adding an osmotic interaction with a dynamic environment, a folding-unfolding process can also be realized. This latter result is a step towards osmotic robotics."
che_etd_192,Mechanism of Action and Gold Nanoparticle Delivery of Pt(IV) Prodrugs of Cisplatin,Chemistry,Inorganic chemistry,"The antitumor effects of platinum(IV) complexes, considered prodrugs for cisplatin, are believed to be due to biological reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II), with the reduction products binding to DNA and other cellular targets. In this work we used pBR322 DNA to capture the products of reduction of oxoplatin, c,t,c-[PtCl2(OH)2(NH3)2], 2, and a carboxylate-modified analog, c,t,c-[PtCl2(OH)(O2CCH2CH2CO2H)(NH3)2], 3, by ascorbic acid (AsA) or glutathione (GSH). Since carbonate plays a significant role in the speciation of platinum complexes in solution, we also investigated the effects of carbonate on the reduction/DNA-binding process. In pH 7.4 buffer in the absence of carbonate, both 2 and 3 are reduced by AsA to cisplatin (confirmed using 195Pt NMR), which binds to and unwinds closed circular DNA in a manner consistent with the formation of the well-known 1, 2 intrastrand DNA crosslink. However, when GSH is used as the reducing agent for 2 and 3, 195Pt NMR shows that cisplatin is not produced in the reaction medium. Although the Pt(II) products bind to closed circular DNA, their effect on the mobility of Form I DNA is different from that produced by cisplatin. When physiological carbonate is present in the reduction medium, 13C NMR shows that Pt(II) carbonato complexes form which block or impede platinum binding to DNA. Another Pt(IV) complex, 1-adamantanemethylamine-Pt(IV), 4, which is also a potential prodrug of cisplatin was synthesized by tethering 1-adamantanemethylamine to oxoplatin using a dicarboxylate linker. To achieve higher anticancer activity and better targeting, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) coated with the host ligand per-6-thio-?- cyclodextrin, was synthesized as a drug delivery vehicle for complex 4. The results of cytotoxicity studies show that the loaded delivery vehicle inhibits the growth of human neuroblastoma cells and optical microscopy indicates that the nanoparticles localize in the nucleus of the cell. The binding of complex 4 and ?-cyclodextrin is also investigated using 1H NMR, and a model with a 1:1 stoichiometry with formation of adamantane dimers is proposed. To achieve better understanding of the effect of recovery time on cell cytotoxicity, the toxic effects of three metal complexes containing the 2,2'-bypyridine ligand, Cu(bpy)(NCS)2, 8, [Cu(bpy)2(H2O)](PF6)2, 9, and Zn(bpy)2(NCS)3, 10, were investigated toward human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH) and ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-3) using two different cytotoxicity assays. The cells were exposed to various concentrations of the compounds for 1 h and the percent inhibition of cell growth, I, measured for various times after exposure, i.e., as a function of the recovery time t. After developing the theory showing the relationship between I and t, the cytotoxicity data were analyzed to reveal that the two copper complexes, 8 and 9, cause the cells to divide at a slower rate than the controls during the recovery period, but the zinc complex, 10, had little or no effect on cell division during the recovery period. The usual metric for reporting cytotoxicity is IC50, which is the concentration of agent required to inhibit cell growth to 50% of the control population. However, since IC50 can depend on the recovery time, t, as is the case for 8 and 9, reporting IC50 for a single recovery time can hide important information about the long-time effects of a cytotoxic agent on the health of the cell population."
idde_etd_54,Mechanisms of Transfer: Modeling Motivational and Self-Regulatory Processes that Promote Transfer of Learning,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Motivation, Problem Solving, Self-Regulation, SEM Modeling, Transfer of Learning","A critical goal of many school and training interventions is to provide learners with the strategies and foundational knowledge that will allow them to tackle novel problems encountered under circumstances different than the learning situations. This is also quite often referred to as the ability to transfer learning. Theories of transfer posit that providing learners with ways to make connections between learning experiences and possible transfer tasks, accumulating domain and strategic and knowledge, and encouraging diverse abstractions of concepts might help promote transfer to new situations. Notably missing among these theories is the role various motivational tendencies play in helping promote transfer. This dissertation describes the development of a new theoretical model linking transfer, self-regulation, motivation, and prior knowledge. Based on extensive empirical and theoretical evidence, the model posits that motivation plays an indirect role in promoting transfer of learning exerting its effect through increased self-regulation. This effect, along with a strong direct effect exerted by prior knowledge, describes the major motivational mechanism by which transfer occurs. The theory also proposes an underlying latent variable structure that groups interest, self-efficacy, and goal orientation as major indicators that measure motivation. Similarly, domain and strategic knowledge are posited as dimensions that encompass prior knowledge. Self-regulated learning is made up of a motivational and cognitive component. The cognitive components model key processes of the cognitive architecture that explains the general learning process. An effort to validate this theory through structural equation modeling (SEM) is described. This includes comparisons to alternative models and discussions about methodological issues related to model fit. The dissertation also features in-depth discussions about the appropriateness of the proposed latent structure as well as a comprehensive exposition of the validity of estimated parameters under conditions where model fit is considered unacceptable. The dissertation concludes with a set of derived conclusions and recommendations that advance the theoretical model towards a more encompassing and rigorous methodology calling for the development of more sensitive and adaptive measurement instruments."

This thesis uses discourse analysis to analyze a television interview and an online comment forum to shed light on the ways in which experts and mothers talk about the impacts of technology on family interaction and parenting practices. I consider how both experts and parents discursively construct the family-technology relationship by analyzing how parents communicate about technology use (both their own and their children's), the emotional and practical elements of decision-making regarding technology and how these reveal ideologies about the impact of technology on parenting. My primary findings support a body of research that indicates that a mention of parenting in general can be interpreted to implicate mothers specifically. As such, the conversation about the relationship between parenting and technology is constrained by cultural ideologies about maternal responsibility for the care of children and philosophies about the affordances of technology, and entangled with questions of access and class. All of this influences how experts and parents negotiate their identities and work to position themselves as competent on each of these fronts."

The theorization in this project utilizes the Black Arts Movement and African Conscious theater frameworks to create an analytical play in which the black community becomes aware of itself through artistic expression that centers on what Larry Neal once described as the &;#8220;black aesthetic.&;#8221; Moreover, it examines identity within the black community &;#8211;identity that is not the product of mainstream societal conceptions of race and color, but is the result of personal experiences and familial circles. At the center of my thesis are black people in Syracuse, whose population has increased dramatically over the past 65 years (since 1950), creating a more diverse cultural environment. Syracuse is a racially tense environment and examination of the constraints placed upon Black Syracusans can play a role in easing the tensions. Included in this equation are African Americans effectively addressing their constraints and becoming self-actualized and self-determined people. At the center of this process is the theatrical play &;#8220;Meeting at Mom&;#8217;s,&;#8221; which is designed to give the black people interviewed a voice for a larger discussion of issues that are important to them and to the Syracuse public."
etd_117,Mercury Transport and Fluxes in the Lake Ontario Basin,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"flux, Great Lakes, Lake Ontario, land-cover, mass balance, mercury","In this dissertation I assess mercury dynamics in the Lake Ontario Basin.  In four interrelated phases, ecosystem mercury concentrations and fluxes were analyzed at increasing scales.  Each phase is presented in order of increasing scale, starting with a reach-by-reach analysis in the Seneca River in New York, then moving up to an analysis of the Lake Ontario watershed, followed by an assessment of Lake Ontario, and culminating with an estimate of atmospheric mercury exchange for the entire Great Lakes Basin.Phase 1 of my research is a multi-year study exploring mercury (Hg) dynamics in the Three Rivers system, with particular emphasis on the Seneca River in Central New York.  In addition to bi-weekly water sampling, additional field investigations were conducted to estimate elemental Hg (Hg0) volatilization rates from the river, and to assess the impacts of zebra mussel metabolism on Hg0 volatilization.  Elemental Hg volatilization was estimated at 1.3 ng m-2 hr-1 for the field season, and was positively correlated to incident solar radiation.  It appears that the clearing of the water column caused by zebra mussels may increase Hg0 volatilization rates due to subsequent increased penetration of incident solar radiation, though additional limiting factors are apparent.  Reach-by-reach Hg mass balances were developed for three river reaches to assess the effects of an intervening hypereutrophic lake, a zone of intense zebra mussel infestation, and contributions from Onondaga Lake which is contaminated with elevated levels of Hg.  It was determined that particulate Hg (THgP) is the dominant form of Hg in the Seneca River, and Hg flux in the ecosystem is governed by flow characteristics.  Intervening Cross Lake serves an important role for Hg transport in the Seneca River, reducing total Hg (THg) flux in the river by over 65% due to deposition of THgP.  Methylmercury (MeHg) concentration increased over the reach of intense zebra mussel infestation, possibly due to support of anaerobic respiration as a result of the zebra mussel oxygen demand.  The river reach receiving input from Onondaga Lake shows a 15% increase in THg flux.  Net atmospheric Hg exchange is in the direction of deposition.  However, direct atmospheric Hg deposition to the water surface plays a minimal role in Seneca River reaches, representing less than 1% of the fluvial Hg flux of the river.  Overall, the Seneca River watershed is a sink for inputs of atmospheric Hg at a rate of 42 kg yr-1, and the watershed efficiently retains >85% of this Hg, exporting approximately 5 kg yr-1 to the Three Rivers confluence.For Phase 2, Hg speciation and concentrations were measured near the mouths of nine tributaries to Lake Ontario during two independent field-sampling programs.  Among the study tributaries, mean THg ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 ng L-1; mean dissolved Hg (THgD) ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 ng L-1; mean THgP ranged from 0.3 to 2.0 ng L-1; and mean MeHg ranged from 0.05 to 0.14 ng L-1.  Watershed land-cover, total suspended solids (TSS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were evaluated as potential controls of Hg.  Significant relationships between THgD and DOC were limited, whereas significant relationships between THgP and TSS were common.  Methylmercury was largely associated with the aqueous phase, and MeHg as a fraction of THg was positively correlated to open water land-cover.  Wetland cover was positively correlated to THg and MeHg particle associations.  A relation was evident between dense urban land-cover and higher THgP fractions.Phase 3 utilized the results of Phase 2 to estimate Hg flux for ten inflowing tributaries and the outlet for Lake Ontario.  Total Hg flux for nine study watersheds that directly drain into the lake ranged from 0.2 kg yr-1 to 13 kg yr-1, with the dominant fluvial THg load from the Niagara River at 154 kg yr-1.  Total Hg loss at the outlet (St. Lawrence River) was 68 kg yr-1.  Fluvial Hg inputs largely (62%) occur in the dissolved fraction and are similar to estimates of atmospheric Hg inputs.  Fluvial mass balances suggest strong in-lake retention of THgP inputs (99%), compared to THgD (45%) and MeHg (22%) fractions.  Wetland land-cover is a good predictor of MeHg yield for Lake Ontario watersheds.  Sediment deposition studies and coupled atmospheric and fluvial Hg fluxes indicate that Lake Ontario is a net sink of Hg inputs and not at steady-state likely due to recent decreases in point source inputs and atmospheric Hg deposition.In Phase 4, rates of surface-air Hg0 fluxes in the literature were synthesized for the Great Lakes Basin (GLB).  For the majority of surfaces, fluxes were net positive (evasion).   Annual Hg0 evasion for the GLB was estimated at 7.7 Mg yr-1, whereas Hg deposition to the area is estimated at 15.9 Mg yr-1.  This analysis therefore suggests the GLB is a net sink for atmospheric Hg.  Land-cover types that contributed most to the annual Hg0 evasion for the GLB are agriculture (~55%) and forest (~25%), and the open water of the Great Lakes (~15%).  Most land-cover types displayed similar areal evasion rates, with a range of 7.0 to 21.0 µg m-2 yr-1.  The highest rates were associated with urban (12.6 µg m-2 yr-1) and agricultural (21.0 µg m-2 yr-1) lands.  Considerable uncertainty was noted in estimates of Hg0 evasion.  Methods used to estimate Hg0 evasion vary, and results are affected based on the methods applied.  A unified methodological approach could partially remedy uncertainty in estimating Hg0 fluxes."
psc_etd_110,Message from the State: Uncovering Effects of Public Policy on Women's Movements in Chile and the Czech Republic,Political Science,"Chile, Czech Republic, policy feedback, social movements, women, women's movements","This study relies on the cases of the Czech Republic and Chile to examine the ways in which state policies affect women's movements' emergence under both authoritarian and democratic political regimes. As such, this dissertation provides some important clues into how citizens' experience with certain policies enhances or delimits their future political action, and how it affects their beliefs and attitudes. Gaining a better understanding about the relationship between policies and civic participation is particularly important in the case of young democracies, which are trying to overcome their authoritarian past, and whose new democratic political regimes are in some instances yet to be fully consolidated.This dissertation suggests that the policy context within which social movements operate is an important factor in shaping what social movements can do. The research presented here reveals that when grievances are present, such as accusations of gender inequality, women are more likely to mobilize in protest in situations when the state uses public policy to define women's role narrowly in terms of traditional division of labor. In contrast, if public policies are enabling women to reconcile their maternal and public roles, women are less like to organize on the basis of their gender identity to protest the state.This occurs on both the individual and group level. In-depth interviews with Czech women reveal that if the state provides policy support to women to reconcile their traditional and public roles, women become less conscious of the state's role in their lives. They tend to view the state as a diffuse set of actors and ideas that do not create a coherent whole. In contrast, if state policies provide little support for women's participation in the public sphere, individuals find it much easier to articulate who the state is and how it affects their lives. Furthermore, public policy also affect movements on the group level - complex policies supporting both women's traditional and public roles are likely to create multiple camps within a formerly unified movement and lead to movement fragmentation and demise. In contrast, policies emphasizing women's traditional roles only make it easy for movement leaders and actors to identify key issues and subsequently organize for collective action."

However, continued growth of this promising area of chemistry has been slowed by severe restrictions and limitations in viable synthetic methodologies leading to difficulties in preparing and characterizing the target compounds. There is clearly a need for the further development of synthetic methodologies and detailed structure function analysis that will promote the further advancement of organoalkaline earth metal chemistry in applications as diverse as materials chemistry and catalysis. This thesis work greatly extends the synthetic options currently available towards organoalkaline earth metal species by introducing redox transmetallation protolysis (RTP), a reaction based on the readily available Ph3Bi as a non-toxic transmetallation agent. Based on a straightforward one-pot procedure and work-up, Ph3Bi based RTP presents a powerful synthetic alternative for the facile preparation of a large variety of heavy alkaline earth metal compounds.The second part of the thesis explores the effect of secondary non covalent interactions on the coordination chemistry as well as thermal properties of a series of novel alkali, alkaline earth, rare earth as well as heterobimetallic alkali/alkaline earth fluoroalkoxides. These compounds showcase the significance of non-covalent M???F-C and agostic interactions on metal stabilization and structural features, providing critical input on ligand design for the design of advanced metal organic vapor deposition (MOCVD) precursor materials. This work also showcases the impact of M???F-C interactions over M?co-ligand coordination, a critical precursor design element as well."
eecs_etd_318,Method of Moment Analysis of Partially Shielded Chiral Bodies of Revolution,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"A chiral body of revolution (BOR) which is partially covered by a thin conducting shield is analyzed using the method of moments (MOM). The axisymmetric system is excited by a plane wave. The total internal fields and the far scattered fields are computed. The problem is solved using the surface equivalence principle. The scattered fields outside the structure are assumed to be produced by an equivalent magnetic surface current that exists on the unshielded part of the BOR surface and an external equivalent electric surface current that exists over all of the BOR surface . These two currents are assumed to radiate in the unbounded external medium. Similarly, the total internal fields are assumed to be produced by the negative of the above magnetic current and an internal equivalent electric surface current that exists over all of the BOR surface, but is the negative of an independent unknown only on the shielded part of . These two currents radiate in the unbounded internal medium. Enforcing continuity of the tangential components of total electric field (E) and total magnetic field (H) on S gives a two coupled integral equations for the two unknown surface currents. The two unknown surface currents are the external equivalent electric surface current and the union of magnetic current ( ) on the unshielded part of and the negative of the internal equivalent electric surface current on the shielded part of . The method of moments as applied to bodies of revolution is used to solve these integral equations numerically. Piecewise linear variation of the currents is assumed along the generating curve of the BOR. The variation of the currents along the circumferential direction is represented by Fourier series. An approximate Galerkin's method is used for testing. Conical and spherical BORs are studied. Computed results for the partially shielded spherical chiral body are in excellent agreement with other data.Theoretical framework developed in chapters two through six factually validated the underlying firm foundation of mathematical physics and sound computational electromagnetic methods of our theory by producing correct scattered fields and radar cross sections of the chiral and perfectly conducting sphere, chiral and perfectly conducting cylinder, chiral and perfectly conducting cone. Chapter seven demonstrates the soundness of the theoretical foundation of this thesis by producing computed results and graphs of not only the case of a perfectly conducting sphere, cylinder and cone but those of the chiral sphere, chiral cylinder, and chiral cone and those of the chiral sphere, chiral cylinder and chiral cone partially covered by rotationally symmetric perfectly conducting surface. The computed results and graphs obtained in chapter seven by the application of our theoretical framework were almost one hundred percent accurate with respect to the conformability of our graph mappings, form of our graphs and accuracy of our graph readings with respect to analytically calculated results and graphs. Our computed results and graphs with respect to the computed results and graphs of early research works that used numerical approach distinctly different than ours were in good agreement."
eecs_etd_327,Method of Moments Analysis of an Aperture in a Thick Ground Plane,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Apertures, Coupling, Method of Moments, Scattering, Thick ground plane, Transmission","The problem of electromagnetic scattering from and transmission through an arbitrarily shaped aperture is considered. The aperture is in a thick infinite perfectly conducting ground plane. The conducting walls of the cavity inside the ground plane are of arbitrary shape. The apertures at both ends of the cavity are also of arbitrary shape. The structure is illuminated by an incident plane electromagnetic wave. The Green's function for this complicated problem is almost impossible to determine. Therefore the surface equivalence principle is used to reduce this complex problem into three simpler ones. Each such problem consists of equivalent surface currents radiating in unbounded media. Therefore the free space Green's function is used for each problem. An equivalent surface magnetic current placed on the top aperture produces the scattered field in the region where the impressed sources are. The total field inside the cavity is produced by two surface equivalent magnetic currents on the apertures and an equivalent surface electric current residing on the walls of the cavity as well as on both apertures. The transmitted field on the opposite side of the impressed sources is computed by an equivalent surface magnetic current residing on the bottom aperture. Enforcing the boundary conditions on the tangential components of electric and magnetic fields on both apertures and on the tangential components of electric field on the cavity walls results in a set of three coupled integral equations for the equivalent surface currents. Whenever possible, image theory is used to simplify the equations. These equations are numerically solved using the method of moments. The surfaces are approximated by planar triangular patches. RWG functions are used for expansion functions. An approximate Galerkin method is used for testing. The method is applicable for the general case where all three regions have different material parameters. Results are computed for the case where all these parameters are the same. The method is applicable for arbitrary sized apertures and cavities. However due to limited computing resources, only problems in the resonance region, where dimensions are comparable to wavelength, are considered here.Computed results are given for the case of two square apertures connected by a square prism, two cross apertures connected by a square prism cavity, two circular apertures connected by a cylindrical cavity, and finally two circular apertures connected by a conical cavity. Our computed results are compared with results in the literature obtained by using other methods. Very good agreement is observed."

The leakage power consumption has received even more attention by increasing demand for mobile devices. Since mobile devices spend a majority of their time in a standby mode, the leakage power savings in standby state is critical to extend battery lifetime. For this reason, low power has become a major factor in designing CMOS circuits.In this dissertation, we propose a novel transistor reordering methodology for leakage reduction. Unlike previous technique, the proposed method provides exact reordering rules for minimum leakage formation by considering all leakage components. Thus, this method formulates an optimized structure for leakage reduction even in complex CMOS logic gate, and can be used in combination with other leakage reduction techniques to achieve further improvement.We also propose a new standby leakage reduction methodology, leakage-aware body biasing, to overcome the shortcomings of a conventional Reverse Body Biasing (RBB) technique. The RBB technique has been used to reduce subthreshold leakage current. Therefore, this technique works well under subthreshold dominant region even though it has intrinsic structural drawbacks. However, such drawbacks cannot be overlooked anymore since gate leakage has become comparable to subthreshold leakage in nanometer-scale region. In addition, BTBT leakage also increases with technology scaling due to the higher doping concentration applied in each process technology. In these circumstances, the objective of leakage minimization is not a single leakage source but the overall leakage sources. The proposed leakage-aware body biasing technique, unlike conventional RBB technique, considers all major leakage sources to minimize the negative effects of existing body biasing approach. This can be achieved by intelligently applying body bias to appropriate CMOS network based on its status (on-/off-state) with the aid of a pin/transistor reordering technique."

The problem is to select the ""best"" of the k populations where ""best"" is well defined in terms of some unknown population parameter. In many univariate parametric and nonparamentric settings, solutions to these ranking and selection problems exist. In the multivariate case, only parametric solutions have been developed. We have developed several methods for solving nonparametric multivariate ranking and selection problems. The problems considered allow an experimenter to select the ""best"" populations based on nonparametric notions of dispersion, location, and distribution. For the first two problems, we use Tukey's Halfspace Depth to define these notions. In the last problem, we make use of a multivariate version of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic for making selections."

This invariant, called the topological conformal dimension, gives a lower bound on the topological Hausdorff dimension of quasisymmetric images of the space.  We obtain results concerning the behavior of this quantity under products and unions, and compute it for some classical fractals.  The range of possible values of the topological conformal dimension is also considered, and we show that this quantity can be fractional.  The main theorem gives a lower bound on topological conformal dimension provided that the space contains a diffuse family of surfaces.  This is parallel to a classical result of Pansu that establishes a lower bound on conformal dimension given the existence of a diffuse family of curves.This thesis also exposes a relationship between Poincare inequalities and the topological Hausdorff dimension.  We give a lower bound on the dimension of Ahlfors regular spaces satisfying a (1,p)-Poincare inequality.  Finally, an iterative construction involving Cantor sets shows that there exist Jordan arcs of arbitrary conformal dimension.The methods used to obtain these results come from general topology, geometric measure theory, real analysis, and analysis on metric spaces."

The weak signals corresponding to single microwave photons require substantial amplification to resolve. When probing quantum excitations of the electromagnetic field, the substantial noise produced by standard amplifiers dominates the signal, therefore, several averages must be accumulated to achieve even a modest signal-to-noise ratio. Even worse, the back-action on the system due to amplifier noise can hasten the decay of the quantum state. In recent years, low-noise microwave-frequency amplification has been advancing rapidly and one field that would benefit greatly from this is circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The development of circuit quantum electrodynamics---which implements techniques of quantum optics at microwave frequencies---has led to revolutionary progress in the field of quantum information science. cQED employs quantum bits (qubits) and superconducting microwave resonators in place of the atoms and cavities used in quantum optics permitting preparation and control of low energy photon states in macroscopic superconducting circuits at millikelvin temperatures. We have developed a microstrip superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) amplifier (MSA) to provide the first stage of amplification for these systems. Employing sub-micron Josephson tunnel junctions for enhanced gain, these MSAs operate at microwave frequencies and are optimized to perform with near quantum-limited noise characteristics.Our MSA is utilized as the first stage of amplification to probe the dynamics of a SQUID oscillator. The SQUID oscillator is a flux-tunable microwave resonator formed by a capacitively shunted dc SQUID. Josephson plasma oscillations are induced by pulsed microwave excitations at the resonant frequency of the oscillator. Once pulsed, decaying plasma oscillations are observed in the time domain. By measuring with pulse amplitudes approaching the critical current of the SQUID, it is possible to probe the free evolution of a highly nonlinear oscillator."
etd_358,MICROTOPOGRAPHIC PATTERNS AFFECT BACTERIAL ADHESION AND BIOFILM FORMATION ON POLY(DIMETHYLSILOXANE),Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Antibiotics, Bacterial biofilm, Bio-manufacturing, Biomaterials, Medical devices, Patterned surfaces","Bacterial biofilms are sessile microbial communities that cause serious problems, such as antibiotic resistant chronic infections in humans, and persistent biofouling of engineering facilities. Biofilm formation is initiated by bacterial adhesion to a surface followed by the formation of microcolonies and further development of heterogeneous structures with water channels between cell clusters. The mechanism of biofilm structural heterogeneity and the bacterial genes involve in structural organization are still poorly understood. Nevertheless, once microbes adhere to a surface and form biofilm on it, they are up to 10-1,000 times more resistant to antimicrobial agents than their free-swimming counterparts. It is well accepted that biofilm formation involves multicellular behaviors, associated with major changes in microbial gene expression and protein synthesis. These changes are influenced by many environmental factors such as surface hydrophobicity, topography, chemistry, and charge. To better understand bacteria-surface interactions and to develop more effective biofilm control, we created poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces with micrometer scale topography and characterized bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on these surfaces. It was found that the wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 cells preferred to align perpendicularly to the orientation of line patterns, while its fliC and pilB mutants did not show such bias and oriented randomly like observed for the wild-type PA14 cells on flat surfaces. Besides, cell clusters on the protruding line patterns were found to increase with the pattern width (from 5 to 20 (mu)m). Moreover, the PDMS surfaces with 10 (mu)m tall hexagon features (15 (mu)m side length and 2 (mu)m inter-pattern distance) reduced Escherichia coli biofilm formation by 70% compared to flat PDMS surfaces. The effects of surface topography on bacterial conjugation were also investigated. These results provided new information about the effects of surface topography on bacterial adhesion and biofilm physiology, which can help develop better control methods.Keywords: biofilm formation, cell attachment, bacterial-surface interaction, conjugation, cluster formation, PDMS surfaces, surface topography."

It utilizes the group members’ narratives about rural-urban difference and modifications to Hindu women’s rituals to explore the continuous construction of middle-class identities in the changing social milieu of contemporary India. In considering the role of ritual in the (re)formation of middle-class identities and communities amongst the SMVS group women of this dissertation, it becomes evident that particular rituals, while earlier indicating a certain caste affiliation (e.g., recitation of Sanskrit verse) have now come to signify class identities as well. The public practicing of particular rituals by a group of middle-class women of multiple castes is therefore an assertion of status that relies on previously defined social distinctions (e.g., caste and gender), but then reinterprets these divisions according to local notions of modern, urban life. By navigating and employing multivalent perceptions of tradition and modernity, urban Tamil women continue to fashion and refashion their own rituals of self-making. From marriage and menstrual pollution to urban religious festivals and community-building, the following dissertation will highlight how rituals are simultaneously being reinvented and reinforced in contemporary south India via an exploration of personal experiences of social change, events key to understanding and appreciating social phenomena and cultural diversity."

This 2 x 3 experimental study recruits participants (n = 46) depending on their experience with violence. A group consists of people who are or who have been involved with the military and the other group consists of civilians. Participants play three types of video games—those showing realistic violence, fantasy violence, and non-violence. To investigate within- and between-subject differences, the study measures presence, self-reported arousal, psychophysiological response (heartrate and skin conductance), and aggression. Results show that participants in the military group feel less presence, more arousal, and more aggression while playing video games depicting realistic violence, suggesting a possible explanation for complicated relationship between concepts."

The purpose of this research study was to explore the process by which an organization adopted and engaged in an mLearning initiative.Built on Rogers (2003) diffusion of innovation research, the case study reports on the contextual factors within the organization and department that informed the mLearning adoption process. The researcher gathered observational data over one-year through active participant- observation within an organization’s technology solutions department. Serving as an instructional designer and gathering data as an academic researcher in the same setting allowed the researcher to gain an intimate view of the adoption process. To collect meaningful data the author used Activity Theory as a critical analysis lens and employed a research framework based on the stages of organizational adoption to understand the data in a longitudinal manner.The findings of this study suggest that the initial adoption of mLearning in the organization studied did not reach sustainable implementation because 1) no clear champion for mLearning existed and; 2) an untested mLearning product was heavily relied upon even though it was being developed in parallel to the mLearning implementation efforts. Interest in mLearning at the organization continued, outside departments desired an mLearning learning management system (LMS) to deliver content as soon as possible. Yet the organization simply was not prepared to accommodate due to delays in the mLearning product development.Keywords: Diffusion of Innovation, Technology Adoption, Activity Theory, Mobile Learning"
mae_etd_66,Modeling and Managing Engineering Changes in a Complex Product Development Process,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Discrete-Event Simulation and Modeling, Engineering Change Management, New Product Development","Today's hyper-competitive worldwide market, turbulent environment, demanding customers, and diverse technological advancements force any corporations who develop new products to look into all the possible areas of improvement in the entire product lifecycle management process. One of the areas that both scholars and practitioners have overlooked in the past is Engineering Change Management (ECM).The vision behind this dissertation is to ultimately bridge this gap by identifying main characteristics of a New Product Development (NPD) process that are potentially associated with the occurrence and magnitude of iterations and Engineering Changes (ECs), developing means to quantify these characteristics as well as the interrelationships between them in a computer simulation model, testing the effects of different parameter settings and various coordination policies on project performance, and finally gaining operational insights considering all relevant EC impacts.The causes for four major ECM problems (occurrence of ECs, long EC lead time, high EC cost, and occurrence frequency of iterations and ECs), are first discussed diagrammatically and qualitatively. Factors that contribute to particular system behavior patterns and the causal links between them are identified through the exploratory construction of causal/causal-loop diagrams. To further understand the nature of NPD/ECM problems and verify the key assumptions made in the conceptual causal framework, three field survey studies were conducted in the summer of 2010 and 2011. Information and data were collected to assess the current practice in automobile and information technology industries where EC problems are commonly encountered.ased upon the intuitive understanding gained from these two preparation work, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is proposed. In addition to combining essential project features, such as concurrent engineering, cross functional integration, resource constraints, etc., it is distinct from existing research by introducing the capability of differentiating and characterizing various levels of uncertainties (activity uncertainty, solution uncertainty, and environmental uncertainty) that are dynamically associated with an NPD project and consequently result in stochastic occurrence of NPD iterations and ECs of two different types (emergent ECs and initiated ECs) as the project unfolds. Moreover, ""feedback-loop"" relationships among model variables are included in the DES model to enable more accurate prediction of dynamic work flow.Using a numerical example, different project-related model features (e.g., learning curve effects, rework likelihood, and level of dependency of product configuration) and coordination policies (e.g., overlapping strategy, rework review strategy, IEC batching policy, and resource allocation policy) are tested and analyzed in detail concerning three major performance indicators: lead time, cost, and quality, based on which decision-making suggestions regarding EC impacts are drawn from a systems perspective. Simulation results confirm that the nonlinear dynamics of interactions between NPD and ECM plays a vital role in determining the final performance of development efforts."
etd_149,"Modeling H-Bonded Uncharged (arginine-tyrosine), or ""BU(RY)"", dyads in activated states of G-protein coupled receptors",Chemistry,"arginine, G protein coupled receptors","We have newly synthesized a number of compounds that permit modeling of interactions between tyrosine and arginine side chains. These include alkylguanidine free bases, both alone and complexed and/or covalently bonded to phenol groups. Examples of the newly-synthesized compounds include p-phenol-dodecyl-guanidine free base, p-phenol-ethyl-guanidine free base and the 1:1 mixture of p-cresol and dodecyl guanidine free base. The synthesis of such molecules, which lack other H-bonding groups besides the phenol and guanidine, facilitates isolation of their interaction. UV and IR spectra indicate that neutral phenol and guanidine free base form an unusually strong H-bonding pair, in both crystalline state and in non-polar solvents such as DMSO and hexane. Using UV spectra and the van 't Hoff equation, an experimental value of ?H? = -74 ? 4 kJ mol-1 was obtained for formation of the p-cresol:dodecylguanidine complex in hexane. This was confirmed by computational modeling in vacuo, using density functional theory. The unusual strength of the guanidine-phenol H-bond is also supported by the presence of large continuum absorbance band in IR spectra of the aforementioned compounds; by their high melting points ; and by the short H-bond length between the phenolic oxygen and one (or two) of the guanidine nitrogens as measured in x-ray crystal structures, and in computational models. All these properties associated with strong H-bonding are much weaker or absent, when these compounds are protonated by an external acid, e.g. HBr, to form phenol + guanidinium dyads. The guanidine-phenol H-bond is strong and highly polarizable due to the similar pKa values of proton donor and acceptor. The position of the proton within the H-bond therefore shifts easily in different environments. For example, IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra showed evidence of increasing proton transfer from phenol to guanidine as the solvent polarity increases from hexane to dimethylsulfoxide. Furthermore, in crystals where methanol co-crystallizes around the H-bonded grouping, IR, 15N solid-state NMR, and x-ray crystallographic measurements showed clearly that there is a near complete proton transfer from phenol to guanidine. We use these results to model h-Bonded Uncharged aRginine-tYrosine dyads, which we term ""BU(RY) motifs"", and hypothesize that such motifs play a role in activated states of 7-TM proteins including both GPCRs and microbial rhodopsins."
etd_432,Modeling the Effects of Acid Deposition and Natural Organic Acids on Surface Waters,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Adirondacks, Biogeochemical model, Critical Loads of acidity, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Naturally occurring organic acids, Total Maximum Daily Loads","Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric and nitric acids has impacted surface waters in the eastern U.S. Controls on anthropogenic S and NOx emissions have resulted in a substantial decrease in acid deposition. Long-term measurements of surface water chemistry indicate contrasting responses of surface waters to this deposition reduction. Streams in Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GRSM), in Tennessee and North Carolina, generally show a delayed response in contrast to lakes in the Adirondacks in New York State which are responding relatively rapidly to decreases in acid deposition. In this dissertation, I used a biogeochemical model, PnET-BGC, as a tool to investigate the influence of acid deposition and watershed characteristics on the extent and rate of surface water response to changes in atmospheric deposition. I applied PnET-BGC model to surface waters in two regions of the eastern US: the Adirondacks and the GRSM. These regions are both highly impacted from acid deposition, but have different watershed characteristics, which results in contrasting responses of surface waters. The focus of my analysis was on surface waters that have been identified by their respective states as acid-impaired. In addition to these impaired waters, I applied the model to other sites where data were available through intensive monitoring programs for the purpose of calibration, confirmation, or extrapolation. In the Adirondacks, 128 lakes have been identified as impaired and 12 streams in the GRSM. Simulation results indicate that surface waters in the Adirondacks are more responsive to controls on SO42- deposition than on NO3- and NH4+, while streams in the GRSM are more responsive to NH4+ rather than SO42- and NO3-.This contrasting response is most likely due to the higher SO42- adsorption capacity of the soil and the lower N retention of the ecosystems in the GRSM, compared to the Adirondacks. I used the critical loads (CLs) and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to project reductions in atmospheric deposition loads that would provide healthy conditions for the fisheries of surface waters in these regions. These concepts are commonly used as tools for communication between scientists and policy makers. In this study, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was used as an indicator of the health of surface waters.I performed a sensitivity analysis of the model for applications to both regions; I found that model simulation of ANC is most sensitive to the model inputs of Ca2+ and Na+ weathering rates, precipitation, maximum air temperature, and SO42- wet deposition. In the Adirondacks, the model simulating ANC was also sensitive to the parameters which were used in an algorithm depicting the acid-base behavior of naturally occurring organic acids. Model sensitivity to organic acid parameters along with the findings from recent studies, which indicate that following control on acid deposition, the acidity of surface waters is shifting from inorganic to organics acids, encouraged me to improve the parameterization of the acid-base characteristics of the naturally occurring organic acids.To accomplish this, I used long-term data from two intensive sites in the northeastern U.S.: the Adirondacks and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. Combining a chemical equilibrium model and an optimization algorithm, I generated a modeling framework to parameterize organic acids in order to provide the best predictions for pH, ANC and inorganic monomeric Al, given the observations of other major solutes. Model parameterization is proposed for application in biogeochemical models such as PnET-BGC. The parameterization of organic acids showed that about 5% of the dissolved organic carbon consists of associated reactive functional groups, with both strong and weak acid characteristics. The parameterization of the organic acids, made using two temporal intervals of surface water data (i.e., 1993-2001 and 2003-2012 time intervals), indicate that the charge density of organic acids increased over time. This pattern suggests that dissolved organic matter recently (i.e., 2003-2012) draining from soil has a different quality, with more acidic characteristics and a greater relative contribution to the acidity of surface waters than dissolved organic matter from an earlier period (i.e., 1993-2001)."
cfs_etd_63,Models of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior,Child and Family Studies,"Adolescents, Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, Structural Equation Modeling","This dissertation tested conceptual frameworks for models of physical activity and sedentary behavior based upon social cognitive theory and ecological models. The sample consisted of 527 7th and 8th graders from 3 rural schools in upstate New York. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that there were direct influences of environmental support, intrapersonal factors, parental modeling for physical activity, and physical health to levels of adolescent physical activity. Sedentary behavior was influenced by parental modeling for sedentary behavior and parental encouragement for sedentary behavior. In addition, using a mediating conceptual framework, intrapersonal factors mediated the relationships of environmental support, encouragement, mental health, and physical health to levels of physical activity. Studying physical activity and sedentary behavior should continue to use guided, theory-based approaches with sound statistical designs. This research supported the conceptualization that physical activity and sedentary behavior are not opposite ends of a spectrum, but are distinct behaviors with different factors of influence."

This two-dimensional structure plays many key roles in the life of a cell. Transmembrane proteins, for example, play the role of a gate for different ions (such as Ca2+). Also found are peripheral proteins that are used as enzymes for different purposes in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Phospholipids, in particular play three key roles. Firstly, some members of this group are used to store energy. Secondly, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties inherent to phospholipids enable them to be used as building blocks of the cell membrane by forming an asymmetric bilayer. This provides a shielding protection against the outer environment while at the same time keeping the organelles and cytosol from leaking out of the cell. Finally lipids are involved in regulating the aggregation of proteins in the membrane. In addition, some subspecies such as phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) are second messenger molecules in their own right, thus playing an important role in cellular signaling events. In my work presented in this thesis, I am focusing on the role of some phospholipids as signaling molecules and in particular the physicochemical underpinnings that could be used in their spatiotemporal organization in the cellular plasma membrane. I am specifically concerned with the important family of phosphatidylinositol lipids. PtdIns are very well known for their role as signaling molecules in numerous cell events. They are located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane as well as part of the membrane of other organelles. Studies of these signaling molecules in their in vivo environment present many challenges: Firstly, the complexity of interactions due to the numerous entities present in eukaryotic cell membranes makes it difficult to establish clear cause and effect relationships. Secondly, due to their size, our inability to probe these biomolecules in a dynamic environment and the lack of appropriate physical and biochemical tools. In contrast, biomimetic membrane models that rely on the amphiphilic properties of phospholipids are powerful tools that enable the study of these molecules in vitro. By having control over the different experimental parameters such as temperature and pH, reliable and repeatable experimental conditions can be created.One of the key questions I investigated in this thesis is related to the clustering mechanism of PtdIns(4, 5)P2 into pools or aggregates that enable independent cellular control of this species by geometric separation. The lateral aggregation of PtdIns(4, 5)P2 and its underlying physical causes is still a matter of debate. In the first part of this thesis I introduce the general information on lipid membranes with a special focus on the PtdIns family and their associated signaling events. In addition, I explain the Langmuir-Blodgett film balance (LB) system as tool to study lipid membranes and lipid interactions. In the second chapter, I describe my work on the lateral compressibility of PtdIns(4, 5)P2, PtdIns and DOPG monolayers and its modulation by bivalent ions using Langmuir monolayers. In addition, a theoretical framework of compressibility that depends on a surface potential induced by a planar layer of charged molecules and ions in the bulk was provided. In the third part, I present my work on the excess Gibbs free energy of the lipid systems PtdIns(4, 5)P2 -POPC, PtdIns(4, 5)P2, and POPC as they are modulated by bivalent ions. In the fourth part, I report on my foray in engineering a light-based system that relies on different dye properties to simulate calcium induced calcium release (CICR) that occurs in many cell types. In the final chapter, I provide a general conclusion and present directions for future research that would build on my findings."
etd_632,Molecular Dynamics Study of Solid-Liquid Heat Transfer and Passive Liquid Flow,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Cooling Devices, Evaporation of droplets, Heat Transfer, Molecular Dynamics, Nano scale, Passive Flow","High heat flux removal is a challenging problem in boilers, electronics cooling, concentrated photovoltaic and other power conversion devices. Heat transfer by phase change is one of the most efficient mechanisms for removing heat from a solid surface. Futuristic electronic devices are expected to generate more than 1000 W/cm2 of heat. Despite the advancements in microscale and nanoscale manufacturing, the maximum passive heat flux removal has been ~300 W/cm2 in pool boiling. Such limitations can be overcome by developing nanoscale thin-film evaporation based devices, which however require a better understanding of surface interactions and liquid vapor phase change process. Evaporation based passive flow is an inspiration from the transpiration process that happens in trees. If we can mimic this process and develop heat removal devices, then we can develop efficient cooling devices. The existing passive flow based cooling devices still needs improvement to meet the future demands. To improve the efficiency and capacity of these devices, we need to explore and quantify the passive flow happening at nanoscales. Experimental techniques have not advanced enough to study these fundamental phenomena at the nanoscale, an alternative method is to perform theoretical study at nanoscales.Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a widely accepted powerful tool for studying a range of fundamental and engineering problems. MD simulations can be utilized to study the passive flow mechanism and heat transfer due to it. To study passive flow using MD, apart from the conventional methods available in MD, we need to have methods to simulate the heat transfer between solid and liquid, local pressure, surface tension, density, temperature calculation methods, realistic boundary conditions, etc. Heat transfer between solid and fluids has been a challenging area in MD simulations, and has only been minimally explored (especially for a practical fluid like water). Conventionally, an equilibrium canonical ensemble (NVT) is simulated using thermostat algorithms. For research in heat transfer involving solid liquid interaction, we need to perform non equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations. In such NEMD simulations, the methods used for simulating heating from a surface is very important and must capture proper physics and thermodynamic properties.Development of MD simulation techniques to simulate solid-liquid heating and the study of fundamental mechanism of passive flow is the main focus of this thesis. An accurate surface-heating algorithm was developed for water which can now allow the study of a whole new set of fundamental heat transfer problems at the nanoscale like surface heating/cooling of droplets, thin-films, etc. The developed algorithm is implemented in the in-house developed C++ MD code. A direct two dimensional local pressure estimation algorithm is also formulated and implemented in the code. With this algorithm, local pressure of argon and platinum interaction is studied. Also, the surface tension of platinum-argon (solid-liquid) was estimated directly from the MD simulations for the first time. Contact angle estimation studies of water on platinum, and argon on platinum were also performed.A thin film of argon is kept above platinum plate and heated in the middle region, leading to the evaporation and pressure reduction thus creating a strong passive flow in the near surface region. This observed passive liquid flow is characterized by estimating the pressure, density, velocity and surface tension using Eulerian mapping method. Using these simulation, we have demonstrated the fundamental nature and origin of surface-driven passive flow. Heat flux removed from the surface is also estimated from the results, which shows a significant improvement can be achieved in thermal management of electronic devices by taking advantage of surface-driven strong passive liquid flow. Further, the local pressure of water on silicon di-oxide surface is estimated using the LAMMPS atomic to continuum (ATC) package towards the goal of simulating the passive flow in water."
bio_etd_83,Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Neonatal Oocyte Survival and Primordial Follicle Formation in the Mouse Ovary,Biology,"Follicle, Mouse, Oocyte, Ovary, Reproductive Biology","In mammals, formation of the primordial follicle is a complex process involving the breakdown of germ cell cysts, where oocytes must separate from each other and subsequently become surrounded by somatic cells. As cysts separate, a large number of germ cells are lost by apoptosis, however the mechanisms by which cyst breakdown and germ cell death occur are not well understood. We first hypothesized that two anti-apoptotic regulators from the BCL2 family of proteins, BCL2 and MCL1, may be responsible for regulating neonatal oocyte survival. To elucidate the effects of BCL2 in the neonatal ovary, we examined ovaries of both Bcl2 overexpressing and knockout transgenic mice. When compared to wild-type mice, neither Bcl2 overexpression nor abrogation significantly altered ovarian histology. Another BCL2 family protein, MCL1, is expressed in human oocytes during ovarian development, suggesting a role for MCL1 in oocyte survival. We found that MCL1 was localized to both oocytes and somatic cells during cyst breakdown. Subsequently, we used an in vitro organ culture system to identify a role for MCL1 in oocyte survival. We found that inhibition of MCL1 with an antibody to MCL1 in culture resulted altered germ cell numbers and oocyte cyst breakdown. Our data demonstrate that while BCL2 is not likely involved in perinatal oocyte survival, MCL1 may be an important regulator of the ovarian primordial follicle reserve. Next, we hypothesized that the KIT signaling pathway may be important for oocyte survival and cyst breakdown in the neonatal ovary. The tyrosine kinase receptor, KIT, and its ligand, KITL, have been implicated in oocyte survival and follicle development in both fetal and adult ovaries but have not been well studied at the perinatal time point. To elucidate the functional role of KIT signaling in the neonatal ovary, we began by using immunohistochemistry to test the expression of KIT and KITL. We found both proteins to be expressed in the developing ovary from 17.5 dpc to PND 3, suggesting an important role for this protein in cyst breakdown or oocyte survival. To test this hypothesis, ovaries from 17.5 dpc fetal mice were cultured for 5 days in control media, or in media with the KIT blocking antibody, ACK2, or recombinant KITL. Our data demonstrated a role for KIT signaling in cyst breakdown, as inhibition and activation of the pathway altered ovarian histology. Using cell proliferation and TUNEL assays at the conclusion of culture, we identified a reduction in somatic cell proliferation when KIT signaling was inhibited and likewise, a decrease in cell death. Finally, we investigated which pathway downstream of KIT affects cyst breakdown and the effect of KIT signaling on MCL1 protein expression. After 3 days in culture with KITL supplemented media, Western blotting was used to analyze the total and phosphorylated forms of proteins from the PI3K, MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways as well as the BCL2 family protein, MCL1. We found that there was an increase in the phosphorylated forms of p44/p42 in the MAPK pathway and a downregulation of MCL1 on KIT activation. Overall our data have shown that while BCL2 may not contribute to oocyte survival during cyst breakdown, both MCL1 and KIT play important roles in formation of the primordial follicle pool."
phy_etd_133,Molecular Sensing with Protein and Solid-State Nanopores,Physics,,"In the past 15 years nanopore sensing has proven to be a successful method for probing a variety of molecules of biological interest, such as DNA, RNA and proteins. Of particular appeal is this technique's ability to probe these molecules without the need for chemical modification or labeling, to do so at physiological conditions, and to probe single molecules at a time, allowing the possibility for results masked in bulk measurements to come to light. In this thesis these advantageous properties will be used in work on both a synthetic (solid-state) nanopore system and an engineered biological nanopore. I will describe the techniques for producing solid-state nanopores in thin membranes of silicon nitride and how these nanopores can be integrated into a fully functioning nanopore sensor system. I will then explore two applications of this system. First, a study of adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a protein found in blood serum, to the inorganic surface of nitride at the single molecule level. A simple physical model describing the behavior of this protein in the nanopore will be shown. Second, a study of the binding of the nucleocapsid protein of HIV-1 (NCp7) to three aptamers of different affinity, specifically three sequence 20mer mimics of the stem-loop 3 (SL3) RNA--the packaging domain of genomic RNA. Additionally, N-ethylmaleimide, which is known to inhibit the binding of NCp7 to a high-affinity SL3 RNA aptamer, will be used to demonstrate that the inhibition of the binding can be monitored in real time.Following these applications of the solid-state nanopore system, I will explore the geometry of a newly engineered biological nanopore, FhuA [Delta]C/[Delta]4L, by using inert polymers to probe the nanopore interior"
phi_etd_68,Moral Luck,Philosophy,"Control Principle, Luck, Moral Luck, Moral Responsibility","The problem of moral luck arises because of an apparent conflict between the luck that humans face, the pervasiveness of moral considerations in our lives, and the idea that moral responsibility requires a level of control that luck robs them of. The claim is that we cannot be governed by luck and be morally responsible. The notions of luck and moral responsibility are developed, and several solutions to the problem of moral luck are discussed and rejected. Finally, a solution is offered that dissolves the problem. In particular, the luck that affects an agent's moral standing comes from the choices that are presented to her from given character traits. This variety of moral luck is found to be genuine and yet to not conflict with a principle that moral responsibility requires control. The agent has control over what choices she makes from her palette of live options, no matter if the range of options is given to her without her choice. So while she lacks complete control, she has the right kind of control for moral responsibility. Hence, there is moral luck, but no problem of moral luck."
etd_226,Moral Worth and Supererogation,Philosophy,"Blameworthiness, Moral worth, Praiseworthiness, Suberogation, Supererogation","In this dissertation, I offer a novel account of the moral praiseworthiness of actions that captures our commonsense intuitions, while enabling a reasons-based definition of moral supererogation.  Morally supererogatory actions are typically understood as actions that have moral worth (i.e. an agent who performs such an action is morally praiseworthy for having performed it), yet they are beyond the scope of duty.  For moral theorists, supererogatory actions have proven difficult to accommodate; however, I show that the definition of moral supererogation my account enables is resistant to objections that threaten competing accountsAccording to my own ""Two-Step"" account of moral worth, in determining the moral praiseworthiness of a given action, we must begin, in the spirit of Julia Markovits's Coincident Reasons Thesis (CRT), by determining the extent to which the noninstrumental reasons recommending (if supererogatory) or requiring (if obligatory) the action coincide with the noninstrumental reasons motivating the agent.  In this first step, we've determined an overlap percentage figure.  Next, we must consider the moral justifying strength of the competing reasons (subjectively) confronting the deliberating agent in her deliberative scenario.  Thus, an action a is morally praiseworthy to the extent that (I) the agent is (non-instrumentally) motivated by the noninstrumental reasons that either recommend or require a; and (II) the agent performs a in the face of competing reasons with moral justifying strength."

The great potential in tailoring polymer structures imparts PUs unique mechanical properties and good cytocompatibility, which make them good candidates for many biomedical devices. In this dissertation, three families of multiblock thermoplastic polyurethanes are synthesized and characterized for biomedical and shape memory applications.In the first case described in Chapters 2, 3 and 4, a novel family of multiblock thermoplastic polyurethanes consisting of poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are presented. These materials were discovered to be very durable, with strain-to-break higher than 1200%. Heat-triggered reversible plasticity shape memory (RPSM) was observed, where the highly deformed samples completely recovered their as-cast shape within one minute when heating above the transition temperature. Instead of conventional ""hard"" blocks, entanglements, which result from high molecular weight, served as the physical crosslinks in this system, engendering shape recovery and preventing flow. Moreover, water-triggered shape memory effect of PCL-PEG TPUs is explored, wherein water permeated into the initially oriented PEG domains, causing rapid shape recovery toward the equilibrium shape upon contact with liquid water. The recovery behavior is found to be dependent on PEG weight percentage in the copolymers. By changing the material from bulk film to electrospun fibrous mat, recovery speed was greatly accelerated. The rate of water recovery was manipulated through structural variables, including thickness of bulk film and diameter of e-spun webs. A new, yet simple shape memory cycle, ""wet-fixing"" is also reported, where both the fixing and recovery ratios can be greatly improved. A detailed microstructural study on one particular composition is presented, revealing the evolution of microphase morphology during the shape memory cycle.Then, in Chapter 5, the role of Polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) in suppressing enzymatic degradation of PCL-PEG TPUs is investigated. In vitro enzymatic hydrolytic biodegradation revealed that POSS incorporation significantly suppressed degradation of PCL-PEG TPUs. All TPUs were surface-eroded by enzymatic attack in which the chemical composition and the bulk mechanical properties exhibited little changes. A surface passivation mechanism is proposed to explain the protection of POSS-containing TPUs from enzymatic degradation.Finally, Chapter 6 presents another POSS-based TPUs system with PLA-based polyol as the glassy soft block. Manipulation of the final thermal and mechanical properties is discussed in terms of different polyols and POSS used. The free recovery and the constrained recovery responses of the polymer films were demonstrated as a function of the prior ""fixing"" deformation temperature. In addition, this family of materials was capable of memorizing their Tg, where optimal recovery breadth and recovery stress were achieved when pre-deformation occurred right at Tg."
bio_etd_85,Multicellular Phenotypic Studies of Single Gene Variants in Myxococcus xanthus,Biology,"G2P, mutant, Myxococcus xanthus, phenotype","There are several systematic methods designed to link genes to cellular processes. These methods are derived from different hypotheses and are largely complementary to each other. This dissertation presents a systematic study of functional genetics and related phenotypes using quantitative methods. The first part of this dissertation will report the successful identification and characterization of 28 genes in the multicellular bacterium Myxococcus xanthus using three different methods: sequence homology, transcription activation and protemoics. The results from this research extended the list of M. xanthus genes involved in multicellularity, and expanded our knowledge regarding the possible molecular pathways underlying physiological and morphological changes.Although the cellular function of some of the genes in the genome of an organism can be deduced from effects of mutation on phenotype, the disruption or deletion of most genes produces little or no discernible phenotypic impact. The reason for this may be redundancy or complementation, or it may be due to the limitations inherent in available assays. The second part of this dissertation will focus on a population genetics approach to the characterization of phenotype for a collection of mutant strains containing insertion mutations in each of the ~200 ABC transporter component genes in M. xanthus. More than 50% of those mutant strains exhibit at least one phenotypic characteristic that is different from the wild type, and an average of 6% of mutant strains have a gain-of-function phenotype. We also demonstrated that the morphological features used to measure phenotype are not entirely independent variables. These results indicate that a rigorous and quantitative phenotypic characterization will provide significantly more data to understand the phenotypic space of M. xanthus, and that a more rigorous definition of phenotype may help us establish a more accurate connection between genotype and phenotype."

The conventional liquid electrolytes based LIBs are prone to failure in conditions such as high operating temperature, solvent leakage, lithium dendrites formation and thermal runaway, etc. All-solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASSLIBs) provide a promising power strategy to overcome the drawbacks of liquid electrolyte by substituting the highly flammable organic liquid electrolyte with solid electrolytes (SEs). However, up to the present time, the SEs fabrication for practical ASSLIB construction is still a significant challenge. The existing problems include 1) lower ionic conductivity compared to liquid electrolyte, 2) poor solid-solid contact interface between electrode and electrolyte, 3) volume change of the electrode and 4) the unstable interface of lithium metal/polymer electrolytes causes further capacity fading. With the aim of fabricating SEs which possess optimal properties, a novel SE was developed by forming a multilayer structure. The multilayer SE was fabricated using polymeric and ceramic electrolytes, which can integrate the merits from different layers and materials and optimize its overall performance.In order to choose an ideal ceramic material for the multilayer electrolyte fabrication, three different types of ceramic electrolyte material were synthesized, characterized and evaluated, including Li1.3Ti1.7Al0.3(PO4)3 (LATP), Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLT). Their mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, ease of fabrication and synthesis, and economic expenses of synthesis were evaluated experimentally. The influence of sintering temperature, synthesis route, working temperature and pressure to the overall conductivity were evaluated. From experimental observation and analysis, it was concluded that LATP was an ideal candidate for multilayer electrolyte fabrication for its high conductivity, ease of fabrication and synthesis, etc.The electrochemical properties of polymer electrolyte PEO10-LiN(CF3SO2)2, which was fabricated through hot pressing and solvent casting methods respectively, and also gel-polymer electrolyte PVdF-HFP-LiN(CF3SO2)2 were characterized. The lithium ion transference number, ionic conductivity and thermo-stability were evaluated and discussed.Based on the characterized ceramic and polymer electrolytes, the multilayer electrolyte was fabricated through various lamination protocols, which include hot pressing, dip coating and spray coating methods. It was found that negligible interfacial resistance exist at LATP/LLT and SPE material. Also, an enhanced ionic conductivity was found for the bilayer of LATP/solvent casted SPE. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of a composition region at the polymer/ceramic electrolyte interface. It was suggested that the boundary of polymer body and ceramic grains may induce a pathway for enhanced ionic transportation. The porous LATP was fabricated using PMMA/PVA/PVB as the pore maker. The influencing factors of sintering temperature, material selection of ceramic and pore makers and fabrication methods deserve further investigation.All-solid-state lithium ion coin cell was successfully fabricated and characterized using the as-prepared multilayer electrolyte and lithium metal anode. The coin cell demonstrated satisfactory charge/discharge capability and cyclability at an elevated temperature of 70 °C. The thickness of SE, operating temperature, material types were important factors in the overall resistance of the multilayer solid electrolyte. The unstable lithium/polymer electrolyte interface at high temperature and high potential is the critical problem for developing ASSLIBs with better cyclability in practice.In the end, future work was proposed and discussed based on the existing work, including 1) multilayer fabrication using glass-ceramic material; 2) optimization of porous ceramic electrolyte; 3) multilayer composite electrolyte using ceramic stabilizer at the lithium/electrolyte interface."

Most NCs are synthesized in air free, non-polar conditions, so surface chemistries must be tuned to accommodate hydrophilic biomolecules. This can be achieved through ligand exchange or polymer encapsulation procedures. This work takes advantage of both phase transfer routes to functionalize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and quantum rods (QRs) with DNA and proteins for self-assembly, energy transfer and drug delivery applications.In the first project, we explored the ability to assemble QDs into clusters with a high degree of control through DNA-mediated interactions. The hydrophobic QDs were first transferred to buffers using a polymer encapsulation approach that used an amphiphilic polymer. The polymer encapsulated QDs were successfully functionalized with oligonucleotides through both EDC/NHS coupling and click chemistry. The final QD/DNA conjugates were assembled into multicolor QD clusters through a colloidal stepwise approach. One of the greatest challenges of this project was an inconsistent batch-to-batch QD/DNA coupling efficiency, which was attributed to the presence of excess polymer, QD aggregates and poor stoichiometry. Purifying QDs via ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient removed excess polymer, leading to a decreased optical scattering and increased DNA loading that was beneficial for increasing coupling efficiency. In these clusters, a decrease in the QD donor emission and an increase in the QD acceptor emission indicated that QD-QD FRET occurred. One disadvantage to using QDs as energy acceptors is their broad absorption profile, which causes them to be coexcited with the donor. To overcome this limitation, a bioluminescent protein can be used to generate QD emission through bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) without external excitation.In the next project, CdSe/CdS quantum rods (QRs) were functionalized with the bioluminescent firefly protein, Photinus pyralis (Ppy). The aim of this project was to improve the long-term stability of the QR/Ppy conjugates. To make these conjugates, hydrophobic CdSe/CdS QRs are rendered hydrophilic through a ligand exchange with histidine (His) followed by an additional ligand exchange to conjugate hexahistagged Ppy proteins to QRs (QR/His/Ppy). In these conjugates, there was a decrease in the stability of the BRET over time. The retention of the BRET signal was significantly improved by changing the QR capping ligand prior to protein conjugation from His to glutathione (GSH). This is because the GSH ligands that remain on the QR surface after Ppy coupling are more highly charged than His, leading to more efficient electrostatic repulsions between QRs. To incorporate the improved QR/Ppy nanoconjugates into the QD/DNA clusters, the QR emission should be a result of non-radiative energy transfer contributions only to prevent simultaneous excitation of the energy donor and acceptor. To investigate the contribution from radiative energy transfer to the BRET signal, control experiments were performed that indicated that most of the BRET signal arises from non-radiative energy transfer from the Ppy to the QR.In the last project, DNA functionalized AuNPs were used as drug carriers for idarubicin (IDA), a clinically approved chemotherapeutic agent. To construct these conjugates, AuNPs are synthesized using a citrate reduction method and a ligand exchange is carried out to exchange the citrate capping molecules with thiol modified DNA and thermoresponsive polymers. Drug binding was investigated using DNA denaturation measurements and kinetic studies. An increase in duplex DNA melting temperature with drug loading verified IDA intercalation at the dsDNA. The kinetics of drug release were investigated at physiological temperature, where the presence of drug outside of a dialysis membrane was monitored through IDA fluorescence. The low drug release, small dissociation rate constant of 0.05 min-1 and high equilibrium constant of 3.0 x 108 M-1 demonstrates that these nanoconjugates can act as efficient vehicles for in vivo drug delivery."
etd_289,Narratives (Re)Creating Racial Identity: Writing Out Loud and Speaking Past Doubt,African American Studies,"Autobiography, Identity, Oral narratives, Post-racial, Written narratives","When President Barack Obama won the democratic presidential nomination in 2008, pundits across the nation began to argue that race was no longer a problem in the United States.  However, because the United States’ social, economic and political foundation was built upon the exploitation of persons of color at the hands of white landowning men, these structures privileging whites over persons of color are embedded into the way each individual in America continues to see themselves.  The ways in which individuals construct their identities and the identities of others is based, in large part, on race.  By analyzing autobiographies published since 2000 in coordination with spoken narratives collected in the summer of 2014, the racial narratives of today become clear.  Just like cotton and the plantations on which it was grown, race is embedded in the fabric of our lives and the stories we tell about ourselves."
etd_410,Navigating the Urban-Rural Divide: The Agency of Rural Chinese Female Higher Education Students in China,Cultural Foundations of Education,"Agency, China, Gender, Higher Education, Rural Female Students, The Urban-Rural Divide","This dissertation explores how rural Chinese female students at urban Chinese higher education institutions conceptualize and negotiate the urban-rural divide that often interplays with gender and the discourse of quality (suzhi) to shape their lives. A substantial body of literature discusses the profound inequalities that rural Chinese people encounter due to the urban-rural divide and household registration system (Chan & Zhang, 1999; Wang & Zuo, 1999; Loong-Yu & Shan, 2007; Tang & Yang, 2008; Whyte, 2010; Han, 2010). An increasing amount of literature also addresses the experiences of rural Chinese migrant women working in urban China (Gaetano & Jacka, 2004; Jacka, 2006; Gaetano, 2004; Gaetano, 2005; Yan, 2008). However, little research has been done on rural Chinese university women. The few articles that do exist tend to blame them or their culture for their failure or struggles (Ren, 2008; Xu, 2007; Wan, 2007), or else focus on the unequal power structures that victimize them (Yu, 2006); but none of these studies incorporates the perspectives of these women. My dissertation fills the scholarly gap by focusing on the voices and perspectives of a group of rural female higher education students who talked about their experiences of negotiating multiple and intersecting power structures.Qualitative methodology and feminist methodology informed this dissertation. To collect data, I conducted open-ended, in-depth interviews with 66 rural female students (51 undergraduates and 15 graduate students) at five public universities and one public college in northern China. This research revealed the profound inequalities that these students experienced in attaining higher education, such as urban primary and secondary schools’ exclusion of rural students, overt and subtle forms of gender discrimination at home and school, regional discrimination reflected in higher education admission policies, and political control and punishment through the National Higher Education Entrance Examination. These had seldom been examined by previous studies.The students that I interviewed also encountered numerous obstacles to their integration into urban campuses; they felt marginalized from mainstream urban life because the dominant culture regarded urban life and people as superior to rural life and people. Despite all these barriers, these women did not allow themselves to be defeated; instead they became active agents by developing strategies to negotiate and resist the barriers when they could. Building upon the work of Daniel G. Solorzano and Dolores Delgano Bernal (2001) and of Tara J. Yosso (2006), I define such agency that my participants exhibited as the ability to navigate the institutional barriers and social norms that constrain their conditions of existence.Though my participants were constrained by the unequal structures of power, they were also aware of the inequalities. They responded by making decisions and devising strategies to become upwardly mobile through educational achievements. It may seem that by striving for educational success, they were merely conforming to the societal norm; but they were also in this way resisting marginalization arising from the dominant cultural capital and the discourse of quality that represents them as inferior or deficient. In response to the discourse of quality, they also exercised their agency by making meaning of their lived experiences with this discourse and/or developing counter-discourses to negotiate it. Furthermore, when they encountered different and sometimes contradictory forms of patriarchy across rural and urban contexts, they expressed their agency by shifting and reformulating their identities."
etd_403,"Negotiating DSE Teaching Identity in Today’s Public Schools:  Complexity, Camaraderie, & Subversion",Teaching and Leadership,"Disability Studies in Education, Teacher Education, Teacher Identity, Teacher Resistance","This dissertation explored the experiences and perspectives of eleven classroom teachers who self-identify and commit to disability studies in their practices in their current roles as teachers in k-12 schools. The study uncovered the lived experience of what it means to take on a disability studies in education (DSE) identity, including the particular pedagogical methods and strategies that these teachers assigned to and named as DSE. Through phenomenological interviewing, participant’s experiences around practicing their identities were recorded and analyzed. The data collected offers a glimpse into how a DSE identity manifests itself within today’s schools, including the complicated and complex personal experiences working within, along with talking back to and reframing the system (of special education and public education). Overall, the study describes the interplay between the meanings that participants confer to their individual ideological commitments, alongside the heightened demands of normative performance that the standards and accountability-based reform has established within today’s schools. In particular, the study focuses on the small and nuanced ways participants have taken up critical practices in order to maintain a DSE identity within their schools and classrooms. Their experiences converged and diverged at various points and their stories were both heartbreaking and heartwarming. Overall, however, they represent the continued labor that critical educators must engage in to maintain a positive sense of self and enact their pedagogical beliefs as educators. In sharing their stories, I hope to provide a glimpse into how these educators conceptualized and experienced DSE in relation to their professional and personal lives."
etd_291,"Negotiating Formal Schooling, Multiple Identities, and Community Advocacy: (Counter)-Narratives of Somali Bantu Refugees in the United States",African American Studies,"Critical race theory, Forced migration, Multicultural education, Race, Refugees, Somali Bantu","""Negotiating Formal Schooling, Multiple Identities, and Community Advocacy: (Counter)-Narratives of the Somali Bantu Refugees in the United States"" examines the educational experiences of Somali-Bantu refugees resettled in Upstate, New York. It explores how they negotiate their multiple identities - race, gender, class, religion, culture, language, accent, and immigrant status -within the formal school setting and environment. Additionally, it highlights the role of the Somali Bantu community organizations in advocating and implementing resettlement services and academic resources for their people. Using critical race theory as theoretical lens and methodology, a qualitative research was conducted to collect data from nine Somali Bantu participants. The findings suggest that the participants experienced both successes and challenges while negotiating formal schooling. Their multiple identities subjected them to bias and discrimination within the schools and the society. Nonetheless, the community organizations play a significant role in supporting their children’s academic achievement as well as sustaining their cultural values and language. Based on the findings, the study recommends strategies and reforms that are conducive for equity in education, academic achievement, and cultural tolerance for a successful transition and integration of the Somali Bantus and other refugees in the United States."
etd_448,Netflix and the Development of the Internet Television Network,Mass Communications,"Broadcasting, Industry Studies, Media History, Netflix, Television Studies","When Netflix launched in April 1998, Internet video was in its infancy.  Eighteen years later, Netflix has developed into the first truly global Internet TV network.  Many books have been written about the five broadcast networks – NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, and the CW – and many about the major cable networks – HBO, CNN, MTV, Nickelodeon, just to name a few – and this is the fitting time to undertake a detailed analysis of how Netflix, as the preeminent Internet TV networks, has come to be.This book, then, combines historical, industrial, and textual analysis to investigate, contextualize, and historicize Netflix's development as an Internet TV network.   The book is split into four chapters.  The first explores the ways in which Netflix's development during its early years a DVD-by-mail company – 1998-2007, a period I am calling ""Netflix as Rental Company"" – lay the foundations for the company's future iterations and successes.  During this period, Netflix adapted DVD distribution to the Internet, revolutionizing the way viewers receive, watch, and choose content, and built a brand reputation on consumer-centric innovation.This reputation served it well during its second phase, ""Netflix as Syndicator"" (2007-12), when the company turned from DVD rentals to online distribution.  In chapter two, I explain who Netflix adapted syndication – a business model that has been a staple of US broadcasting for half a century – to Internet distribution.  By doing so, Netflix up-ended both the TV industry's traditional content release structures and viewers' habits.  By shifting TV distribution to the Internet, Netflix drastically increased the control viewers have over where, when, and on what devices viewers watch TV.In its third phase, Netflix entered the original programming business by subtly adapting traditional program genres, content, and release schedules to Internet video.  I split this phase – ""Netflix as Internet Network"" (2012-present) – into two chapters.  While many of Netflix's concerns parallel those of traditional networks – in terms of production and financing, for example – Internet networks also have a number of unique concerns in areas such as Net Neutrality and distribution windows.  Netflix has led the charge on these issues, and chapter three explores Netflix's role as the first Internet network, including the development of its binge-viewing strategy and its push into international distribution.Finally, chapter four takes a deep dive in Netflix's foray into original program production.  In its third phase, Netflix has adapted traditional TV structures to Internet distribution.  Despite the innovations in short-form and user-generated content that sites like YouTube, Crackle, and Twitch have named, Netflix's traditional approach to programming has set the template for successful Internet networks that has been adopted by the likes of Hulu, Amazon, and Yahoo Screen.  Chapter four analyses Netflix's biggest programs - including House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Daredevil and others - to explain how Netflix has adapted traditional TV genres and structures to the freedoms in production, marketing, and content possibilities that the Internet affords.In the same was that NBC set the example for broadcast networks in the 1950s and HBO developed the framework for cable TV in the 1990s, Netflix has set the template for Internet TV in the 2000s.  Netflix's mix of technological advancements, consumer-centric practices, personalized content, and global mindset have become the gold standard for the how-and-why of developing a successful Internet TV network.  Although other aspiring Internet networks Hulu and Amazon started out with a different ethos than Netflix, Netflix's financial, creative, and cultural success has forced a series of reactionary decisions from both Hulu and Amazon that have brought them closer and closer to the foundations Netflix began laying out in 1998.  So while the Netflix model isn't the only possible model for an Internet network, it has become the blueprint for the newly-developing Internet TV ecosystem."
etd_125,Network Theoretic Analyses and Enhancements of Evolutionary Algorithms,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Algorithms, Evolutionary Computation, Genetic Algorithms, Learning Classifier Systems, Network Science","Information in evolutionary algorithms is available at multiple levels; however most analyses focus on the individual level. This dissertation extracts useful information from networks and communities formed by examining interrelationships between individuals in the populations as they change with time.Network theoretic analyses are extremely useful in multiple fields and applications, e.g., biology (regulation of gene expression), organizational behavior (social networks), and intelligence data analysis (message traffic on the Internet). Evolving populations are represented as dynamic networks, and we show that changes in population characteristics can be recognized at the level of the networks representing successive generations, with implications for possible improvements in the evolutionary algorithm, e.g., in deciding when a population is prematurely converging, and when a reinitialization of the population may be beneficial to avoid computational effort, or to improve the probability of finding better points to examine.In this dissertation, we show that network theoretic analyses can be applied to study, analyze and improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms. We propose various approaches to study the dynamic behavior of evolutionary algorithms, each highlighting the benefits of studying community-level behaviors, using graph properties and metrics to analyze evolutionary algorithms, identifying imminent convergence, and identifying time points at which it would help to reseed a fraction of the population.Improvements to evolutionary algorithms result in alleviating the effects of premature convergence occurrences, and saving computational effort by reaching better solutions faster. We demonstrate that this new approach, using network science to analyze evolutionary algorithms, is advantageous for a variety of evolutionary algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Learning Classifier Systems."
etd_567,Neuromorphic Learning Systems for Supervised and Unsupervised Applications,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"The advancements in high performance computing (HPC) have enabled the large-scale implementation of neuromorphic learning models and pushed the research on computational intelligence into a new era. Those bio-inspired models are constructed on top of unified building blocks, i.e. neurons, and have revealed potentials for learning of complex information. Two major challenges remain in neuromorphic computing. Firstly, sophisticated structuring methods are needed to determine the connectivity of the neurons in order to model various problems accurately. Secondly, the models need to adapt to non-traditional architectures for improved computation speed and energy efficiency. In this thesis, we address these two problems and apply our techniques to different cognitive applications.This thesis first presents the self-structured confabulation network for anomaly detection. Among the machine learning applications, unsupervised detection of the anomalous streams is especially challenging because it requires both detection accuracy and real-time performance. Designing a computing framework that harnesses the growing computing power of the multicore systems while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity to the anomalies is an urgent research need. We present AnRAD (Anomaly Recognition And Detection), a bio-inspired detection framework that performs probabilistic inferences. We leverage the mutual information between the features and develop a self-structuring procedure that learns a succinct confabulation network from the unlabeled data. This network is capable of fast incremental learning, which continuously refines the knowledge base from the data streams. Compared to several existing anomaly detection methods, the proposed approach provides competitive detection accuracy as well as the insight to reason the decision making. Furthermore, we exploit the massive parallel structure of the AnRAD framework. Our implementation of the recall algorithms on the graphic processing unit (GPU) and the Xeon Phi co-processor both obtain substantial speedups over the sequential implementation on general-purpose microprocessor (GPP). The implementation enables real-time service to concurrent data streams with diversified contexts, and can be applied to large problems with multiple local patterns. Experimental results demonstrate high computing performance and memory efficiency. For vehicle abnormal behavior detection, the framework is able to monitor up to 16000 vehicles and their interactions in real-time with a single commodity co-processor, and uses less than 0.2ms for each testing subject.While adapting our streaming anomaly detection model to mobile devices or unmanned systems, the key challenge is to deliver required performance under the stringent power constraint. To address the paradox between performance and power consumption, brain-inspired hardware, such as the IBM Neurosynaptic System, has been developed to enable low power implementation of neural models. As a follow-up to the AnRAD framework, we proposed to port the detection network to the TrueNorth architecture. Implementing inference based anomaly detection on a neurosynaptic processor is not straightforward due to hardware limitations. A design flow and the supporting component library are developed to flexibly map the learned detection networks to the neurosynaptic cores. Instead of the popular rate code, burst code is adopted in the design, which represents numerical value using the phase of a burst of spike trains. This does not only reduce the hardware complexity, but also increases the result's accuracy. A Corelet library, NeoInfer-TN, is implemented for basic operations in burst code and two-phase pipelines are constructed based on the library components. The design can be configured for different tradeoffs between detection accuracy, hardware resource consumptions, throughput and energy. We evaluate the system using network intrusion detection data streams. The results show higher detection rate than some conventional approaches and real-time performance, with only 50mW power consumption. Overall, it achieves 10^8 operations per Joule.In addition to the modeling and implementation of unsupervised anomaly detection, we also investigate a supervised learning model based on neural networks and deep fragment embedding and apply it to text-image retrieval. The study aims at bridging the gap between image and natural language.  It continues to improve the bidirectional retrieval performance across the modalities. Unlike existing works that target at single sentence densely describing the image objects, we elevate the topic to associating deep image representations with noisy texts that are only loosely correlated. Based on text-image fragment embedding, our model employs a sequential configuration, connects two embedding stages together. The first stage learns the relevancy of the text fragments, and the second stage uses the filtered output from the first one to improve the matching results. The model also integrates multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN) to construct the image fragments, in which rich context information such as human faces can be extracted to increase the alignment accuracy. The proposed method is evaluated with both synthetic dataset and real-world dataset collected from picture news website. The results show up to 50% ranking performance improvement over the comparison models."
etd_645,New Destinations of Empire: Imperial Migration from the Marshall Islands to Northwest Arkansas,Geography,"Arkansas, Citizenship, Marshall Islands, Migration, Race, U.S. Empire","This dissertation examines Marshall Islander migration to Arkansas as an outcome of an international agreement, the Compact of Free Association, between the U.S. and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), a former U.S. territory. While the Compact marked the formal end of U.S. colonial administration over the islands, it also re-entrenched imperial power relations between the two countries, at once consolidating U.S. military access to the islands and creating a Marshallese diaspora whose largest resettlement site is now Springdale, Arkansas. As a result, Springdale, an “all-white town” for much of the 20th century, has recently been remade by Marshallese and also Latino immigration, nearly tripling in size in the past three decades. I examine U.S. empire through three interrelated lenses: through an imperial policy, the Compact of Free Association (COFA); through an imperial diaspora, the Marshallese diaspora; and through the town of Springdale, Arkansas, a new immigrant destination for Marshall Islanders, which I argue has become a new destination of empire. These three lenses reveal how empire’s interrelated workings—migration, militarization, racialization, labor, detention, capitalism, and the law, among others—inform one another to uphold U.S. imperial power and how U.S. empire both engenders and constrains mobility for its subjects. I argue that COFA status, the visa-free immigration status granted to Marshallese immigrants, is a type of imperial citizenship and that its partial, contingent, and revocable character produces precarity for those who hold it, placing them alongside other groups of imperial citizens from U.S. non-sovereign territories. Due to a lack of awareness of U.S. empire, however, long-term residents in new destinations of empire like Springdale are unable to comprehend Marshall Islanders as imperial citizens. Instead, their interpretations of Marshall Islanders’ presence are woven back into dominant narratives of U.S. exceptionalism. Such interpretations of why COFA status exists exemplify and perpetuate an occlusion of U.S. empire. In Springdale, in other words, the refrain—‘We are here because you were there’, commonly used to explain the presence of imperial migrants elsewhere—was never heard and, thus, never placed in the context of empire."

The writing curriculum for ""globalized classrooms"" should be responsive to the resources students bring with them to the classroom and cultivate in them the multiple literacies--both old and new--needed to successfully navigate an increasingly global workplace and a complexly interwoven world. The scaffolding of students' natural meaning making capacities, and teaching of multiple literacies, such as visual, academic, critical, digital, multimodal, and intercultural, should take place simultaneously in the writing classes for ""new literacies are in a synergistic, reciprocal, and constantly evolving relationship with older literacies"" (Swenson et al. 357). The interplay of new and old literacies in literate activities in the academy and professions can lead to productive interactions and work. In fact, this study is an experiment with and investigation into how diverse students in a sophomore level writing class in a large research university in the U.S. North East responded to a curriculum and pedagogical approach framed around the idea of multiple literacies. The pilot course drew insights and resources from some closely aligned fields of new media, globalization, World Englishes, intercultural communication, literacy studies, and media studies, exploring and exploiting the potentials these intersecting fields have for improving the practice of teaching writing to a diverse body of students. It took a multiliterate approach to teaching writing in its expanded sense with assignments in multiple media and modes-- alphabetic and digital literacy narratives, rhetorical analysis of a digital artifact (music video, ad, cartoon/movie clip etc.), argument essay, remediation of argument essay into web forms for local and global audiences, collaborative documentary production, blogging, and small group presentations."
etd_517,New Perspectives on the Role of Attributions in  Entrepreneurship.,Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises,,"My dissertation seeks to explore some of the causes and consequences of managerial attributions for firm performance in the hope that it can shed light on the role of attributions in entrepreneurship. More specifically, I ask the following questions in each of the papers: What is the current state of research on managerial attributions for firm level outcomes and how can it contribute to future research (paper 1)? How do attributions for performance by the top management affect the extent to which firms engage in corporate entrepreneurship (paper 2)? How does being a family firm affect the way in which firm’s top management makes attributions for performance (paper 3)? Methodologically, I explore these questions in two ways. One, I conduct a theme-relevant review of prior attribution literature and two, I empirically capture the different types of attributions that are made for firm performance in the management discussion and analysis sections of firms’ annual reports. In doing so, my dissertation reveals the different ways in which attribution theory has been used to understand the antecedents, moderators and outcomes of attribution, and exemplifies the theory’s potential by looking at how it can help answer questions in entrepreneurship. I also show that attributions can capture the way in which the top management frames the future prospects of the firm and that in turn attributions moderate the relationship between slack and corporate entrepreneurship. Finally, I find that family firms attribute performance differently than non-family firms."
etd_175,NEW SURFACE AND BULK SHAPE MEMORY EFFECTS IN POLYMERS FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Active Cell Culture, Amphiphilic Copolymers, Safer Needle Devices, Shape Memory Polymers, Surface Wrinkling","Shape memory polymers (SMPs) is a class of polymeric materials that are capable of changing shapes under an external stimulus such as heat, light, solvents and electromagnetic induction. In this dissertation, we explore both the bulk and surface shape memory effect of polymers, understand the material properties, and develop potential applications.In the first case (Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Chapter 4), wrinkles were developed utilizing the surface SM effect and were applied for cell culture. Wrinkling has been generally understood as a stress-driven instability phenomenon. In our bilayer system, the wrinkle formation is enabled by compressive buckling of a gold coating that is first applied to an SMP that has been fixed with a temporary uniaxial strain. The bilayer system is then recovered thermally to generate the wrinkles. The fundamentals of wrinkle characteristics and formation were investigated in Chapter 2. Gold film thickness and applied prestrain of the SMP substrate show a direct impact on wrinkle amplitude and wavelength. Our wrinkle system also features a time-evolved and temperature-dependent wrinkle formation.On the pre-wrinkled substrates prepared with various prestrains, the degree of cell alignment (Chapter 3) was found to increase until saturation occurred, which can be attributed to both the increase in wrinkle orientation and the increase in crack density. Cell behavior on pre-wrinkled substrates and on actively wrinkling substrates was compared. Namely, for active substrates, wrinkle formation was induced during cell culture via increasing the medium temperature. In the active cell culture study, cell alignment can be activated by triggering wrinkle formation during active cell culture. Inspired by the cell application in Chapter 3, a functionally graded wrinkled surface was developed in Chapter 4 utilizing a Tg gradient shape memory polymer, which can allow for rapid and high-throughput investigations for a cell mechanobiology study.Chapters 5-6 present two safer needle designs and fabrication methods that utilize the bulk shape memory effect. The heat-curling needle developed in Chapter 5 can curl upon heating, disabling the sharp needle to ensure a safe disposal. The sharp needle tip was achieved by freeze-fracturing the extruded polymer shaft in a torsional mode. Chapter 6 takes another route to create a safer needle that employs a water-triggered shape memory polymer. The concept of this safe needle device is to build a blunt needle that can be released later to shield the sharp needle once the injection is competed. Here, the release of the blunt needle is activated by the SMP that is triggered by water contact. An electrospinning technique was used to fabricate fibers featuring a high surface-to-volume ratio and tunable porosity, which can allow a fast water penetration.  Electrospun poly(vinyl acetate) PVAc was selected for this application due to its unique water shrinkage behavior and good shape memory properties.Finally, Chapter 7 presents a biodegradable amphiphilic co-network system containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL). By changing the relative composition of the two components, tunable thermal and thermomechanical properties can be achieved. Both co-networks and homo-networks exhibited good shape memory properties. Upon water contact, co-networks turned into hydrogels due to the hydrophilic nature of PEG. Further microstructure was revealed by x-ray scattering analysis. Moreover, the biodegradability was assessed in lipase-containing medium.Overall, different biomedical applications were developed using shape memory polymers, which feature great potential for practical applications due to their high performance, tunable thermal and mechanical properties, and low cost. Some recommendations for future research and development are discussed in Chapter 8."

bce_etd_63,Nitric Oxide Releasing Polymers For Vascular Graft Applications,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"Nitric oxide [NO] is an endogenous gas involved in a multitude of physiological functions, ranging from vasodilatation, inflammatory response to inhibition of platelet aggregation. Significant interest exists for therapeutic application of exogenous NO, particularly for the improvement of foreign-body responses of biomaterials. One challenge amongst several others that must be taken into consideration is NO's short half-life, ranging from 2-3 s, in physiological systems. Researchers have worked on synthesizing materials, formally referred to as NO donors/NONOates capable of preserving NO and spontaneous gas release upon contact with blood under physiological conditions. Two groups of these commercially available NO donors known as diazeniumdiolates and nitrosothiols have been shown to be biological active. Unfortunately, current commercially available NO donors, particularly diazeniumdiolates have short half-lives, ranging from a few seconds to a maximum of 20 h under physiological conditions. Many studies have shown diverse approaches for slowing down NO release for appropriate therapeutic application unfortunately, elimination of undesirable spontaneous NO release, still remains an elusive goal. In the first chapter, a POSS-based NO donor capable of 8-fold more NO-loading efficiency per mol of donor, in comparison to current commercially available NO donors is presented. Various characterization techniques were used to confirm successful NO-modification and determination of NO-loading efficiency. Ten mols of NO were successfully detected on the POSS/NO compound, which is higher than the loading efficiency of commercial NO donors.The inadequacy associated with commercially available NO donors is not only related with their NO-loading inefficiency, but also in the delivery of sustained and controlled NO release. Motivated by this problem we introduce a biomimetic approach with the development of a novel NO-releasing elastomeric composite system capable of controlled and sustained NO release under physiological conditions. The NO donor was incorporated into a two-part elastomeric composite system comprised of hydrophobic electrospun fibers and a silicone-based elastomeric polymer. Utilization of a fibrous elastomeric composite, permeable to gas and water molecules, enabled very gradual penetration of water into the system thus, preventing immediate NO donor hydrolysis in aqueous medium. Experimental results showed the control group, without the elastomeric component, released NO spontaneously whilst the fibrous composite system exhibited remarkable controlled and sustained NO release. Considering the biomimetic and NO-releasing properties of our elastomeric composite system, utilization of the system towards vascular graft application was also studied. The idea behind this NO-based therapy was to provide a material that will not only mimic native blood vessels, but would also enable endothelial cell [EC] proliferation, promoted by long-term NO release post-surgical intervention. In collaboration with a vascular surgeon, the composite grafts were tested under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The mechanical properties of the NO-releasing elastomeric tubes were comparable to native blood vessels and showed adequate suturability and suture retention strength."

The purpose of this study was to discover how Sedlacek’s (2004a) Noncognitive Questionnaire (NCQ) and Duckworth & Quinn’s (2009) Grit-S predicted baccalaureate nursing student academic performance and persistence in the junior year, when considered in conjunction with academic variables such as previous college GPAs and the SAT.  Three cohorts of junior year nursing students (N= 150) answered the survey, and their academic records were combed for previous college GPAs and SAT scores.  After the junior academic year, these variables were regressed on junior year student grade point averages and persistence in the major (dependent variables) to determine predictors of academic success among this student group.

These results impact the practice of nursing education in several ways, and lead to suggestions for further research."
etd_467,Nonparametric Anomaly Detection and Secure Communication,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"degraded broadcast channel, distribution-free test, kernel mean embedding, nonparametric anomaly detection, secrecy capacity region, secure communication","Two major security challenges in information systems are detection of anomalous data patterns that reflect malicious intrusions into data storage systems and protection of data from malicious eavesdropping during data transmissions. The first problem typically involves design of statistical tests to identify data variations, and the second problem generally involves design of communication schemes to transmit data securely in the presence of malicious eavesdroppers. The main theme of this thesis is to exploit information theoretic and statistical tools to address the above two security issues in order to provide information theoretically provable security, i.e., anomaly detection with vanishing probability of error and guaranteed secure communication with vanishing leakage rate at eavesdroppers.First, the anomaly detection problem is investigated, in which typical and anomalous patterns (i.e., distributions that generate data) are unknown \emph{a priori}. Two types of problems are investigated. The first problem considers detection of the existence of anomalous geometric structures over networks, and the second problem considers the detection of a set of anomalous data streams out of a large number of data streams. In both problems, anomalous data are assumed to be generated by a distribution $q$, which is different from a distribution $p$ generating typical samples. For both problems, kernel-based tests are proposed, which are based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) that measures the distance between mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These tests are nonparametric without exploiting the information about $p$ and $q$ and are universally applicable to arbitrary $p$ and $q$. Furthermore, these tests are shown to be statistically consistent under certain conditions on the parameters of the problems. These conditions are further shown to be necessary or nearly necessary, which implies that the  MMD-based tests are order level optimal or nearly order level optimal. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed tests.The secure communication problem is then investigated, for which the focus is on degraded broadcast channels. In such channels, one transmitter sends messages to multiple receivers, the channel quality of which can be ordered. Two specific models are studied. In the first model, layered decoding and layered secrecy are required, i.e., each receiver  decodes one more message than the receiver with one level worse channel quality, and this message should be kept secure from all receivers with worse channel qualities. In the second model, secrecy only outside a bounded range is required, i.e., each message is required to be kept secure from the receiver with two-level worse channel quality. Communication schemes for both models are designed and the corresponding achievable rate regions (i.e., inner bounds on the capacity region) are characterized. Furthermore, outer bounds on the capacity region are developed, which match the inner bounds, and hence the secrecy capacity regions  are established for both models."

In this interpretation, ethnic migration represents three distinct patterns--shared ethnicity, a moral duty toward ethnic migrants and preference within receiving states' legislative and institutional practices. In looking at the movement of North Korean migrants to the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and their socio-economic integration experience, this study affirms these patterns exist. In addition, this paper's findings indicate that despite preferential treatment and generous support from receiving states, ethnic migrants do not fully enjoy economic stability and social acceptance in their new homeland. They often face the same difficulties as non-ethnic migrants.I address the following research questions in this study: 1) What are the perceived benefits of South Korea's settlement support policy versus the realities? and 2) How well does the policy promote these migrants' integration into South Korean society? To answer these questions, I utilize two research methods: an archival, in-depth analysis of policy documents related to South Korea's settlement support policy and in-depth field interviews conducted from November 2006 to June 2007. Follow-up interviews continued until August 2008.The findings show South Korea's settlement support policy is a significant determinant of North Korean migrants' movement to South Korea because they expect it will provide them with economic security, personal safety and social acceptance. However, in reality, the policy does not serve their real economic and societal needs. The findings of the study support that common ethnicity and preferential treatment do not automatically open the door for integration of ethnic migrants (Tinguy, 2003:125.)"
etd_449,Novel Methods and Self-Reinforced Composite Materials for Assessment and Prevention of Fretting Corrosion in Modular Tapers,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Composite, Corrosion, Medical Device, PEEK, Polyethylene, Taper","Novel methods for assessing the electrochemical and micromechanical performance of modular tapers were evaluated, and self-reinforced composite materials were developed for their potential to prevent the onset of mechanically assisted corrosion in modular taper devices.A study of the seating and taper locking mechanics of modular taper samples was conducted, and the effect on taper engagement strength of seating load, loading rate, taper moisture, and taper design/material combination was studied. The load-displacement behavior was captured during seating, and the subsequent pull off load was correlated to seating displacement, seating energy, and seating load. The primary factor affecting taper engagement strength was seating load, and loading rate and design/material factors did not have a significant impact on the quality of the taper engagement.Next, the effect of variation of 7 different design, material, and surgical factors on the fretting corrosion and micromechanical behavior during incremental cyclic fretting corrosion testing was examined using a design of experiments matrix. Seating load and head offset length were the most influential factors affecting fretting corrosion, with low seating loads and high head offsets giving rise to increased currents during sequentially incremented cyclic loads.Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) fibers were produced, and the effects of varying draw down ratio, molecular weight, and post-spinning treatment on the structural and mechanical properties of the fibers were studied. Highly drawn fibers showed the highest increase in molecular orientation and mechanical properties. PEEK fibers were then utilized in the design and fabrication of self-reinforced composite PEEK (SRC-PEEK) thin film composites, and self-reinforced composite ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (SRC-PE) produced from Spectra fiber was also introduced. Pin on disk studies were employed to understand the potential of both of these SRC materials to effectively insulate CoCrMo/Ti6Al4V alloy interfaces during cyclic fretting motion at contact stresses similar to those that might be experienced in modular taper junctions. SRC-PEEK and SRC-PE reduced fretting currents by approximately two orders of magnitude as compared to metal-metal interfaces, and sliding mechanics for SRC-PEEK lined samples were similar to metal-metal interfaces, while SRC-PE samples created a much lower COF at the interface.Finally, SRC-PEEK and SRC-PE gaskets were created to sleeve the trunnions of modular tapers and insulate the head from the trunnion. Cyclic fretting corrosion techniques were employed to assess the ability of SRCs to reduce or prevent the onset of fretting corrosion in the modular taper junction. In a set of three short-term tests assessing the effects of incremented cyclic loads, frequencies, and working electrode potential, SRC lined samples prevented the onset of fretting corrosion and had significantly lower currents than severely corroding metal-metal samples. In long-term million cycle cyclic fretting corrosion testing, the SRC gaskets did not experience failure at any point throughout the test and did not allow for the onset of corrosion currents. Inspection of the gaskets following all testing confirmed that the SRC gaskets withstood the high contact stresses and abrasive fretting motion experienced during the cyclic tests performed, indicating that SRC-PEEK and SRC-PE may be suitable candidates as new materials to prevent the onset of fretting corrosion in modular taper junctions."
che_etd_193,Nucleophilic Carbon-Carbon Bond-Forming Reactions of 2-Methylenetetrahydropyrans,Chemistry,"2-Methylenetetrahydropyran, Carbonyl-Ene, Exocyclic Enol Ether, Pyrans, Three Component Coupling, trioxadispiroketal","Reactions with 2-methylenetetrahydropyrans are underutilized in the literature, especially with respect to general methods demonstrating their nucleophilic nature. This work provides three general methods toward the synthesis of 2-?-oxygenated pyranyl substrates, which are key structural components of many biologically active polyketides and natural products.The use of exocyclic enol ethers as nucleophiles was first demonstrated as a general process in three-component coupling reactions with secondary nucleophiles. The 2-?-hydroxy tetrahydropyran products were obtained in good to excellent yields through promotion with stoichiometric levels of titanium(IV) chloride at reduced temperatures. Only activated aldehydes or ketones worked as efficient coupling partners for this method. The point at which the secondary nucleophile was added to the reaction in progress was governed by the level of electrophile activation and in turn the amount of oxonium ion present for immediate capture. NOE studies determined that cis-tetrahydropyran products are solely formed with C6-substituted enol ether substrates.The carbonyl-ene reaction of exocyclic enol ethers provides 2-? hydroxy dihydropyrans in excellent yields at room temperature. This process only requires catalytic levels of zinc chloride, and both activated and non-activated carbonyl-enophiles act as appropriate coupling partners. These mild reaction conditions produce dihydropyranyl substrates, which are equipped for further functionalization through the newly formed olefin. 2-Methylenetetrahydropyrans, bearing either mono- or di-substitution about the tetrahydropyran ring, were synthesized to determine if any chiral influence could be channeled to the dihydropyranyl products. The diastereomeric ratios of resulting products showed that exocyclic enol ethers with C3 mono- substitution or 2-methylenetetrahydropyrans with di-substitution, where at least one group is held axial, produced moderate levels of selectivity. Alternatively, the other substrates studied in this project demonstrated only low levels of chirality induction.The carbonyl-ene reaction of exocyclic enol ethers has been applied bi-directionally to iodomethyl-2-methylenetetrahydropyrans to provide bis-?-hydroxypyrans. Good to excellent yields were obtained for the initial carbonyl-ene coupling and subsequent iodine elimination. The second carbonyl-ene coupling of 2-methylenedihydropyran was only effected with highly activated enophile components with zinc(II) chloride as the promoter. This reaction with ethyl glyoxylate proceeded in good to excellent yield with catalytic zinc(II) chloride. Only moderate yields of the pyranyl products were obtained with p-nitrobenzaldehyde and equimolar levels of zinc chloride. The bis-?-hydroxypyran products manufactured from this process are theoretically furnished for further functionalization into trioxadispiroketal systems. Attempted cyclization of these substrates under a number of acidic conditions failed to provide the desired bis-spiroketal systems. Therefore a step-wise approach to their manufacture was attempted, although this too failed to produce the bis-spirocyclic system due to difficulties experienced with iodide elimination."
etd_177,Numerical study of a hybrid re-centering viscous fluid energy dissipative device for seismic protection,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"frame re-centering, nonlinear time history analysis, performance-based seismic design, shape memory alloys, Steel moment resisting frames, viscous fluid damper","A hybrid re-centering viscous fluid (RCVF) energy dissipative device is proposed and numerically evaluated in this thesis. Based on the results of a series of nonlinear analyses, performance characteristics of a series of multi-story frames are discussed, and design guidelines for implementing the device in moment resisting frames (MRF) are provided.In performance-based seismic design, peak and residual displacements are important performance indices that engineers can use to evaluate the performance and damage level of a structure. Steel MRF are commonly used for buildings, but they tend to develop large peak and residual displacements in severe earthquakes. Many performance enhancing devices such as viscous fluid damper, metallic yield damper, and buckling restrained braces have been studied and proposed over the years to enhance the performance of MRF. Although these devices can reduce the peak response of MRF, they are not capable of re-centering MRF that have experienced inelastic deformations. The proposed hybrid RCVF device has both energy dissipation and re-centering capabilities to improve the overall performance of MRF.The hybrid RCVF device comprises two parts: shape memory alloy (SMA) wires and a viscous fluid (VF) damper. Due to their superelasticity effect, the SMA wires are able to provide the necessary re-centering capability even when the structure has deformed into the inelastic range. On the other hand, the viscous fluid damper can absorb seismic energy transmitted to the structure, thus increasing its equivalent damping ratio which in turn helps to reduce its peak deformation. The hybrid RCVF device can be mounted on top of supporting braces in the form of inverted Chevron brace or connected directly to the core wall as part of a link beam.Nonlinear static and time history analyses are conducted on a series of shear frames and MRF to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid RCVF device in structural re-centering and seismic energy dissipation. The frames are modeled using finite element method incorporating beam-column elements with geometric and material nonlinearities. The SMA wires are modeled with an established constitutive model, and the viscous fluid damper is modeled using a linear Maxwell model. The performance of the proposed hybrid RCVF device is compared with other energy dissipative devices in the numerical analyses. The results suggest that the hybrid RCVF can be very effective in reducing peak and residual deformations of MRF.Design guidelines are proposed to facilitate the implementation of the hybrid RCVF device in MRF. A design example is provided, and the design is verified using nonlinear static and time history analyses."
soc_etd_77,"Nursing the Nation: Globalization, Gender, Race, State and African Immigrant Women in Health Care Work in the United States of America",Sociology,"African Immigrants, Gender, Health Care Work, Immigration","This dissertation explores the labor market experiences of West African immigrant women from Nigeria, Ghana Sierra Leone and Liberia. Using qualitative research methods, this study interrogates the processes that have facilitated the entry of West African immigrant women into the nursing field in the United States. Informed by Transnational and Black Feminist analyses, this project examines their experiences and processes of identity formation in the face of racial and gendered hierarchies at work. The analysis shows how socio-economic and political conditions in the home countries, United States immigration policies, structural demands in the U.S labor market, especially gendered and racialized demands in health care and the racial hierarchies within the nursing field have create the conditions that have enabled West African women to enter the United States labor market as nurses. This project also examines the workings of informal social networks and formal businesses and entrepreneurial initiatives formed by African immigrant groups that create the conditions that allow for their location in this industry. This project finds that Africans are located in the care industry, often times in positions at the base of labor hierarchies in the field. This study has significance for immigration scholars, feminists and labor activists and provides much needed information about the socio-economic and political contexts against which African immigrants enter the United States labor market. It also draws attention the experiences of West African immigrant women and their subjective understandings of work in the health care industry. The presence of nurse staffing, placement and recruitment agencies formed by West African immigrants in the Washington D.C metropolitan area, adds to our understanding of systems of labor brokerage of health care workers in the United States. The understanding of labor migration, initiated by immigrant groups who exercise tremendous agency, withstand severe constrains and enter the United States' health care industry as professional workers provides useful ways for policy makers and activists concerned with the labor shortages in hospitals and nursing homes to channel their efforts in ways that may improve the conditions of this group"
psy_etd_177,Obesity Indices and Cognitive Function in Veterans,Psychology,"Body Mass Index, Cognitive Function, Neuropsychological Function, Obesity, Veteran, Waist Circumference","Obesity is linked to many chronic health conditions and middle-aged obesity is associated with later-life dementia. Obesity rates in veterans are higher than in the civilian population. Research examining body mass index (BMI) and cognitive function has demonstrated that young to middle-aged obese adults consistently demonstrate deficits in memory and executive function. Waist circumference (WC) is another measure of obesity that has been investigated as it relates to cognitive function; however, a clear pattern of deficit has not yet emerged. This study's purpose was to investigate the relationship among BMI, WC, and cognitive function in male veterans aged 18-55. One hundred and seventeen veterans participated in this one-session study. Participants had their height and weight measured, completed questionnaires that assessed demographic information and other health-related variables, and completed a battery of cognitive tests. A chart review of each participant's medical record was conducted, and relevant diagnoses and medications were extracted. A factor analysis (FA) of the cognitive outcome variables was conducted for data reduction purposes and FA results were used to create the following factors: Speeded Measures, Verbal Fluency, Memory, and Executive Function. Then, four-step hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with BMI and WC entered as the main predictor variables. Results revealed no significant relationship between obesity indices and cognitive function after controlling for relevant variables. Post hoc analyses were then conducted. Composite scores were created based on the conceptual basis of the neuropsychological outcome measures: Memory, Executive Function, Verbal Fluency, Attention, and Psychomotor Speed. Regression analyses were rerun using these scores. Results revealed no significant relationship between any index of obesity and cognitive function. Implications of these findings are discussed."
etd_640,Observation of J/psi p resonances consistent with pentaquark states in Lambda_b^0 to J/psi K^- p decays,Physics,"Hadrons, LHC, LHCb, Pentaquarks","The observation of structures consistent with charmonium-pentaquark states decaying to $J/\psi p$ in $\Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow J/\psi K^- p$ decays is presented. The data sample analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 $fb^{-1}$ acquired with the LHCb detector from 7 and 8 TeV $pp$ collisions. An amplitude analysis was performed which utilized all six kinematic degrees of freedom in the decay. It was shown that adequate descriptions of the data are unattainable with only $K^- p$ resonances in the amplitude model. For satisfactory fits of the data, it was found to be necessary to include two $J/\psi p$ resonances, with each having significances of over 9 standard deviations. One has a mass of $4449.8\pm1.7\pm2.2$ MeV and a width of $39\pm5\pm16$ MeV, while the second is broader, with a mass of $4380\pm8\pm29$ MeV and a width of $205\pm18\pm87$ MeV. The $J^P$ assignments could not be uniquely determined, though there is a preference for one to have spin $3/2$ and the other spin $5/2$ with an opposite parity to the first. The data sample was also inspected in a model-independent way for the presence of $J/\psi p$ or $J/\psi K^-$ contributions. It was demonstrated at more than 9 standard deviations that the data cannot be described with $K^- p$ contributions alone, and that $J/\psi p$ contributions play a dominant role in this incompatibility. These model-independent results support the model-dependent evidence for $P_c^+\rightarrow J/\psi p$ charmonium-pentaquark states provided by the amplitude analysis."
etd_304,"Observing, Understanding, and Manipulating Biological Membranes",Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Membranes, Supported Lipid Bilayers","The phospholipid bilayer is one of the hallmarks of eukaryotic life. This complicated two dimensionally fluid surface is composed of a double layer of lipids which have a region that is hydrophobic and a region that is hydrophilic. The lipid bilayer membranes of a cell act as a barrier that distinguishes the cells and the organelles interiors from the outside environment. In order for the cell to be able to effectively communicate across these impermeable barriers they have evolved many intricate systems of lipid and protein interaction that serve to transmit information from one side of the membrane to the other. The abundance of functionality in the membrane has made them incredibly complicated and intricate structures. This complexity makes the study of any one membrane associated signaling pathway or system more often than not very challenging if not impossible. Because of this a simplified analogue of the biological membrane is necessary for controlled and quantitative studies. The amphiphilic nature of phospholipids allows researcher to create lipid bilayer that can be controlled for composition and placed on a surface that is accessible to many investigative systems. These supported lipid bilayer (SLB) systems have been used for decades to figure out the intricate series of actions and reactions that occur in a natural biomembrane. While there is still a lot to be learned from simple lipid bilayer systems there is also now the need to produce bilayers that incorporate more of the functions of a living cell. These will permit the study of signaling systems involving multiple molecules, the direct observation of cellular responses to surface stimuli, and even the control of cellular behavior. Along with providing greater versatility in the study of cells and membrane mediated systems these enhanced lipid bilayers will have major biomedical applications. Given that a lipid bilayer is the exterior presented by cells in nature there can be no more biocompatible surface than a lipid bilayer, for the surface treatment of medical devices this could have great implications. For instance, if sufficient knowledge is developed about these systems, then all types of medical implants could have a customized lipid bilayer based coating that would help it to integrate perfectly with the tissue to which it is embedded. Joint replacements could have a surface that would promote the growth of osteoblast cells, a cardiac stent could have a coating to prevent clot formation while promoting epithelial cell growth and discouraging smooth muscle cell growth, perhaps even neural implants capable of two way communication for the treatment of paralysis.It is with this long term vision that we set out to advance the field of lipid bilayer systems to increase the capacity for dynamic control, artificial enhancement, and tissue interface. A series of investigations were undertaken with the goal of promoting each one of these facets.In the first investigation we studied the dynamic behavior of the PIP2 phospholipid in varying physiological calcium concentrations. This anionic lipid has been hypothesized to have the capacity to organize itself spatially in response to fluctuations in calcium levels. No investigation has been so far carried out that look at PIP2s reaction to physiologically relevant changes in the calcium concentration. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis to look at changes in the dynamics and the brightness of PIP2 in polymer supported lipid bilayers. We found that PIP2 appears to make electrostatic associations with zwitterionic lipids in the bilayer when there is no calcium present which are disrupted with the addition of calcium.In the second investigation we developed a genetically encoded protein/lipid anchoring system based on an aldehyde. This system allows proteins to be genetically modified to bear a 6 amino acid consensus sequence at, theoretically any position along its amino acid chain. This consensus sequence targets a cysteine within the sequence to a formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) that converts the cysteine to a formylglycine. Formylglycine bears an aldehyde on one of its residues. Aldehydes are found very rarely in the mammals and are also highly reactive with certain elements such as aminooxy and hydrazides which are also very rare in mammalian biology. This makes an aldehyde an excellent anchoring method for medical applications. We produced aldehyde tagged enhanced green fluorescent proteins (EGFP) and successfully incorporated them with aminooxy modified lipids in a supported lipid bilayer. This showed that the system is a viable and in fact improved alternative to the lipid/protein anchoring systems currently in use.The third investigation centered on the capacity to culture cells on a SLB surface. Previous studies have found that SLBs have an anti-adhesion property for both proteins and cells. We investigated whether the inclusion of various quantities of both positively and negatively charged lipid into the bilayer would effect the capacity of fibroblast cells to adhere and proliferate. Our system prototyped a novel high throughput technique for bilayer/cell investigations. We found that cells initially had difficulty in adhering to all bilayer surfaces but the inclusion of greater quantities of negatively charged lipids produced a more favorable environment for cell growth. We also looked at how glycolipids, commonly held to be promoters of cell recognition and adhesion, effected fibroblast cells. Such bilayers with sugar elaborations were as suitable for fibroblast growth as the control subjects on collagenated glass. These findings are a significant advancement in the development of bilayer - cell interfaces.This body of work has provided exciting advances in the capacity to produce and understand biomimetic surfaces. While there is much work to be done yet before fully interfacial surfaces are possible, I have developed some novel tools and unearth some interesting findings that can provide some of the next steps towards this goal"
etd_666,OCCUPATIONAL STRESS AND HEALTH  AMONG HOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS,Social Sciences,"home health care, long-term care, occupational health, occupational stress, work-related stress","Home health care workers fill an essential role in the daily lives of elderly persons. However, the work is physically and emotionally exhausting. This mixed-methods study explicates sources of stress found in agency-based caregiving in the post-industrial economy. Agencies operate under a highly regulated legal and organizational framework, but little is known about how to reduce sources of job strain to better protect workers’ health. Drawing on existing occupational health stress theories (Karasek; Siegrist; Landsbergis) and sociological stress theory (Pearlin; Fenwick & Tausig), this study explores how workers’ experiences and agency characteristics are related to home health care worker’s occupational health and self-rated health.Multinomial logistic regression models estimate the health impacts of occupational stressors among home health care workers using data from the CDC’s National Home Health Aide Survey (n=3,235). Qualitative analysis feature the analysis of both agency executives’ and home health care workers’ narratives (n=45) from nine upstate New York home care agencies. By interrogating upper and mid-level management in addition to the workers, the agency’s inner workings were made more transparent.Detailed results upheld Demand/Control/Support and Effort-Reward Imbalance theories while also demonstrating that discrimination on the job and double burden care routines are negatively associated with health. Unexpectedly, blacks were less likely to report injuries than whites. The finding suggests black are under-reporting and may be at risk for occupational health inequality because they are not accessing workers’ compensation. Aides report financial strain, exposure to poor working conditions and lack of respect on the job as centrally important. Agency leaders’ responses vary, but generally concede that high-level stressors “trickle down” and can become work-related stressors for home health aides. Lack of training and low-quality training are also implicated in impeding progress in addressing home care workers’ health.Demand for home health care workers is urgent as the baby boomers age into later life. Policy work in a changing health care system requires coordination at the federal, state, and agency levels to achieve appropriate compensation, updated training, greater access to occupational health care and healthier work conditions - leading to improvement in the quality of home-based long-term care."

etd_634,On Distributed and Acoustic Sensing for Situational Awareness,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Acoustic sensor, Decentralized inference, Detection, Estimation, Room shape recovery","Recent advances in electronics enable the development of small-sized, low-cost, low-power, multi-functional sensor nodes that possess local processing capability as well as to work collaboratively through communications. They are able to sense, collect, and process data from the surrounding environment locally. Collaboration among the nodes are enabled due to their integrated communication capability. Such a system, generally referred to as sensor networks are widely used in various of areas, such as environmental monitoring, asset tracking, indoor navigation, etc.This thesis consists of two separate applications of such mobile sensors. In this first part, we study decentralized inference problems with dependent observations in wireless sensor networks. Two separate problems are addressed in this part: one pertaining to collaborative spectrum sensing while the other on distributed parameter estimation with correlated additive Gaussian noise. In the second part, we employ a single acoustic sensor with co-located microphone and loudspeaker to reconstruct a 2-D convex polygonal room shape.For spectrum sensing, we study the optimality of energy detection that has been widely used in the literature. This thesis studies the potential optimality (or sub-optimality) of the energy detector in spectrum sensing. With a single sensing node, we show that the energy detector is provably optimal for most cases and for the case when it is not theoretically optimal, its performance is nearly indistinguishable from the true optimal detector. For cooperative spectrum sensing where multiple nodes are employed, we use a recently proposed framework for distributed detection with dependent observations to establish the optimality of energy detector for several cooperative spectrum sensing systems and point out difficulties for the remaining cases.The second problem in decentralized inference studied in this thesis is to investigate the impact of noise correlation on decentralized estimation performance. For a tandem network with correlated additive Gaussian noises, we establish that threshold quantizer on local observations is optimal in the sense of maximizing Fisher information at the fusion center; this is true despite the fact that subsequent estimators may differ at the fusion center, depending on the statistical distribution of the parameter to be estimated. In addition, it is always beneficial to have the better sensor (i.e. the one with higher signal-to-noise ratio) serve as the fusion center in a tandem network for all correlation regimes. Finally, we identify different correlation regimes in terms of their impact on the estimation performance. These include the well known case where negatively correlated noises benefit estimation performance as it facilitates noise cancellation, as well as two distinct regimes with positively correlated noises compared with that of the independent case.In the second part of this thesis, a practical problem of room shape reconstruction using first-order acoustic echoes is explored. Specifically, a single mobile node, with co-located loudspeaker, microphone and internal motion sensors, is deployed and times of arrival of the first-order echoes are measured and used to recover room shape. Two separate cases are studied: the first assumes no knowledge about the sensor trajectory, and the second one assumes partial knowledge on the sensor movement. For either case, the uniqueness of the mapping between the first-order echoes and the room geometry is discussed. Without any trajectory information, we show that first-order echoes are sufficient to recover 2-D room shapes for all convex polygons with the exception of parallelograms. Algorithmic procedure is developed to eliminate the higher-order echoes among the collected echoes in order to retrieve the room geometry. In the second case, the mapping is proved for any convex polygonal shapes when partial trajectory information from internal motion sensors is available.. A practical algorithm for room reconstruction in the presence of noise and higher order echoes is proposed."
phi_etd_70,On Pessimism: A Study in Normative Psychology,Philosophy,Pessimism,"I aim to revive pessimism as a topic of philosophical discussion. Toward that end, I defend a theory of pessimism designed to locate pessimism within the existing philosophical literature, and to account for the epistemic and prudential conditions under which pessimism is warranted. I argue for three main theses: (1) pessimism is a stance in which one takes oneself to live in a `not good-enough' world; (2) pessimism is not necessarily the product of an emotional problem, a character defect, or unjustifiable metaphysical assumptions; and (3) pessimism can be prudentially appropriate, and--perhaps most controversially--is epistemically warranted. In an appendix, I consider the philosophical challenges posed by radical pessimism, and what I call the secular problem of evil."
etd_321,On robust and secure wireless communication system design using software-defined radios,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"authentication, cognitive radio, communication system, MIMO, software-defined radio, wireless communication","This dissertation is composed of three parts: airborne multi input multi output (MIMO) communications, physical layer authentication, and software radio design for DARPA Spectrum Challenge.  A common theme for the three distinct problems is the system perspective that we have adopted throughout this dissertation. Instead of considering isolated issues within these problems, we have provided a holistic design approach to the three problems and have implemented all three systems using the GNU Radio/USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) platform.In the first part, we develop a MIMO communication system for airborne platforms. MIMO communication has long been considered to be suitable only for environment that is rich in scatterers.  This, unfortunately is not the case for airborne platforms. However, this lack of scattering can be compensated by the large aperture of the airborne MIMO platform; this is corroborated by our careful analysis using real measurement data. Our analysis of the airborne MIMO channels leads  to the development of a variable rate MIMO transceiver architecture.  This architecture is numerically shown to improve the bit error rate (BER) over conventional transceiver architectures that are developed for rich scattering environments.  A software radio based MIMO system is then implemented to demonstrate experimentally the efficacy of the developed architecture.In the second part, we develop a physical layer authentication scheme as a counter measure to primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in cognitive radio (CR) networks. In this attack, a malicious user emulates the signal characteristics of the primary user (PU) when it is silent which prevents unsuspecting secondary user (SU) from utilizing the network. The developed physical layer authentication is based on embedding cryptographic hash signatures, referred to as authentication tags, within PU's signal constellations.  The embedding is performed such that the legacy receivers are not affected.  We analyze the scheme using the fast fading Rayleigh channel model and  present an optimal scheme to embed signals in PU's constellations which minimizes the tag BER.  Experimental results are obtained that corroborate our theoretical claims, thereby establish that reliable authentication can be achieved without sacrificing signal quality at the primary receivers.In the final part, we describe in detail our design of software radios developed as part of the DARPA Spectrum Challenge (DSC), a year long competition that started in January 2013 and concluded in March 2014 with the final tournament held in Arlington, VA at the DARPA headquarter. DSC was comprised of two tournaments, competitive and cooperative.  In the competitive mode two radio pairs, each composed of a transmitter and a receiver, are pitted against each other to transmit the most amount of data error-free while operating concurrently in the same frequency band.  In the cooperative mode, three radio pairs have to share a frequency band in a cooperative manner wherein the goal is to maximize the throughput of all the three pairs.  We describe the design of our software radio system that integrates some key technologies crucial in operating in an environment that does not allow user coordination and spectrum pre-planning, including: spectrum sensing, adaptive transmission both in spectrum utilization and transmission rate, opportunistic jamming, and sliding window feedback. The developed radio is robust in the presence of unknown interference and achieves the desired balance between throughput and reliability in an uncoordinated transmission environment."
etd_702,"ON THE CUSP OF INVISIBILITY: THE LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY, MARGINALIZED STUDENTS, AND INSTITUTIONAL SPACES",Writing Program,"counterstory, decolonial, literacies, mobilities, storytelling","This dissertation considers the potential for decolonial possibilities for and democratic participation of students in three rhetorical and institutional spaces: the writing center, the classroom, and the archives. The Lower Río Grande Valley, the site of the study, is located at the Southernmost end of Texas, and is situated between the almost 2,000-mile-long geopolitical border spanning from Brownsville, Texas to San Diego, California and the internal checkpoints that run parallel to and 70 miles north of the border. The Lower Río Grande Valley has remained a Mexican American cultural province and zone despite six phases of colonization. Little is known of Mexican American uses and practices of literacy, rhetoric, and identity in the discipline of Rhetoric and Composition. This is even more apparent in regards to Mexican Americans of the Lower Río Grande Valley. On one level, this dissertation focuses on the historical and current state of colonization in the Lower Río Grande Valley. On another level, this dissertation is interested in the presentation and representation of culture through place making, meaning-making practices, and knowledge production. Part historiographical and archival, part ethnographic and decolonial, this rhetorical project brings into focus a region and student demographic that has remained on the cusp of invisibility in society, the academy, and the discipline of rhetoric and composition. The contribution of this research includes developing spatial and temporal awareness, increasing attention to local and regional cultural differences, and articulating decolonial possibilities."
etd_590,On the Design and Analysis of Secure Inference Networks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Byzantine Attack, Eavesdropping, Inference Networks, Jamming, Security","Parallel-topology inference networks consist of spatially-distributed sensing agents that collect and transmit observations to a central node called the fusion center (FC), so that a global inference is made regarding the phenomenon-of-interest (PoI). In this dissertation, we address two types of statistical inference, namely binary-hypothesis testing and scalar parameter estimation in parallel-topology inference networks. We address three different types of security threats in parallel-topology inference networks, namely Eavesdropping (Data-Confidentiality), Byzantine (Data-Integrity) or Jamming (Data-Availability) attacks. In an attempt to alleviate information leakage to the eavesdropper, we present optimal/near-optimal binary quantizers under two different frameworks, namely differential secrecy where the difference in performances between the FC and Eve is maximized, and constrained secrecy where FC’s performance is maximized in the presence of tolerable secrecy constraints. We also propose near-optimal transmit diversity mechanisms at the sensing agents in detection networks in the presence of tolerable secrecy constraints. In the context of distributed inference networks with M-ary quantized sensing data, we propose a novel Byzantine attack model and find optimal attack strategies that minimize KL Divergence at the FC in the presence of both ideal and non-ideal channels. Furthermore, we also propose a novel deviation-based reputation scheme to detect Byzantine nodes in a distributed inference network. Finally, we investigate optimal jamming attacks in detection networks where the jammer distributes its power across the sensing and the communication channels. We also model the interaction between the jammer and a centralized detection network as a complete information zero-sum game. We find closed-form expressions for pure-strategy Nash equilibria and show that both the players converge to these equilibria in a repeated game. Finally, we show that the jammer finds no incentive to employ pure-strategy equilibria, and causes greater impact on the network performance by employing mixed strategies."

One chapter explains the notion of analysis Leibniz invokes in his infinite-analysis theory of contingency, and defends that theory against a pair of objections. Another argues against a series of counterpossible analyses of essence. A third chapter argues that ontological realists should define Theodore Sider’s notion of fundamentality in terms of real definition, because Sider’s primitivism about fundamentality undermines his arguments for ontological realism, and a better argument for ontological realism can be stated in terms of real definition. The final chapter offers a theory of reduction and realism in terms of metaphysical analysis and ground, and uses that theory to offer some novel reductions of properties, numbers, and morality."
etd_605,Online News: Gateway to the Credibility Unicorn,Communications Management,"credibility in media, online newspapers, traditional newspaper","Credibility as it relates to news media has long been an area of interest and study.  As a key media selection factor, it is important to understand how credibility impacts media organizations and the news consumer.  The advent of online news added yet another dimension to the study of how news consumers perceive credibility and the effect that perception has on that particular medium.   Previous research considered the credibility of newspapers, the credibility of broadcast news and the credibility of blogs, this paper explores the credibility of online news, specifically online newspapers, as compared to the credibility of print newspapers. The ability for anyone with internet access to upload anything for public consumption was at first considered rouge news, primarily due to the lack of editorial control.  However, this paper explores the idea that the very characteristics inherent to online news, such as hyperlinks and video directly contribute to credibility.   The experiment for this paper researched the credibility perceptions of American news consumers when considering the same news story in a print newspaper format and in an online newspaper format.  This study subsequently reviews the implications of understanding what elements contribute to the perception of credibility."

Critical political consciousness is defined as awareness of hegemonic social structures and their relationship to intersectional embodied identities, accompanied by a desire for equality and justice. Critical self-aware consciousness is understood as awareness of: one's own public and subjective identities; agency; how life experiences affect different aspects of the self; and the interconnectedness of individuals, communities, and the Pacha Mama (Kichwa for Mother Nature or Mother Universe).I combined participant observation, interview, focus group, survey and photovoice methods to research local, regional, and national level organizations in Ecuador between 2010 and 2013. To examine how activists can better concientizar (raise the consciousness of) their members, I draw on sociocultural learning theory to analyze how identity, consciousness and epistemological ignorance are learned, unlearned and relearned. I interrogate how women learn to code their surroundings; attain language and other tools as they become part of communities of practice of girls, women, and organizations, oppressed or privileged communities; and as they learn different types of consciousness. I examine how learning is facilitated by individuals' openness to new perspectives and pedagogies that teach the whole person (including mind, body, emotions and spirit) in connection to her community.I find that consciousness is contradictory. People think and act from the social location corresponding to their intersectional embodied identities, internalizing hegemonic social forces' teachings at the same time they resist them, often appropriating both oppression and privilege. I explore the contradictions created by this and how they impact individuals and their communities of practice. My research recommends that academics interested in social change attend to ideas such as self-aware consciousness and sumak kawsay wisdom. It suggests that organizations facilitate critical self-aware consciousness in addition to critical political consciousness to further the development of empathy and solidarity between organizational members with different as well as similar intersectional embodied identities."
etd_667,"Opportunity, but at what cost? African-American parents' experiences in a predominantly white school",Cultural Foundations of Education,,"National measures of student achievement, such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), provide evidence of the gap in success between African-American and white students.  Despite national calls for increased school accountability and focus on achievement gaps, many African-American children continue to struggle in school academically, as compared to their white peers.  Ladson-Billings (2006) argues that a deeper understanding of the legacy of disparity in funding for schools serving primarily African-American students, shutting out African-American parents from civic participation, and unfair treatment of African-Americans despite their contributions to the United States is necessary to complicate the discourse about African-American student performance.  The deficit model that uses student snapshots of achievement such as the NAEP and other national assessments to explain the achievement gap suggests that there is something wrong with African-American children.  As Cowen Pitre (2104) explains, however, “the deficit model theory blames the victim without acknowledging the unequal educational and social structures that deny African-American students access to a quality education (2014, pg. 212).  To reframe the deficit discourse, Linda Darling-Hammond (2010) identifies key factors contributing to an opportunity gap including, unequal access to qualified teachers and a lack of access to high-quality curriculum.  This dissertation examined the opportunity gap at a particular predominantly white school.  Specifically, I explored the experiences of African-American parents as they navigated and negotiated the institutional challenges and everyday racism they faced in a suburban environment.Four African-American parents from one suburban school district took part in this study.  Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and observations, and was informed by theoretical work around race, racism, systemic racism theory, whiteness, racial microaggressions, and the unconscious habits of racial privilege.  Results of this study revealed that African-American parents experienced various manifestations of institutional racism and everyday occurrences of microaggressions that required them to navigate and negotiate this suburban environment.  Institutional racism and everyday instances of microaggressions restricted parents’ ability to fully access the educational opportunities that were available for their children."
etd_172,Optical Spring Stabilization,Physics,,"The Advanced LIGO detectors will soon be online with enough sensitivity to begin detecting gravitational waves, based on conservative estimates of the rate of neutron star inspirals. These first detections are sure to be significant, however, we will always strive to do better. More questions will be asked about the nature of neutron star material, rates of black hole inspirals, electromagnetic counterparts, etc. To begin to answer all of the questions aLIGO will bring us we will need even better sensitivity in future gravitational wave detectors.This thesis addresses one aspect that will limit us in the future: angular stability of the test masses. Angular stability in advanced LIGO uses an active feedback system. We are proposing to replace the active feedback system with a passive one, eliminating sensing noise contributions. This technique uses the radiation pressure of light inside a cavity as a stable optical spring, fundamentally the same as technique developed by Corbitt, et al. [1] with an additional degree of freedom.I will review the theory of the one dimensional technique and discuss the multidimensional control theory and angular trap setup. I will then present results from the one-dimensional trap which we have built and tested. And propose improvements for the angular trap experiment.Along the way we have discovered an interesting coupling with thermal expansion due to round trip absorption in the high reflective coatings. The front surface HR coating limits our spring stability in this experiment due to the high circulating power and small beam spot size."
etd_508,Optimal Inference for Distributed Detection,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Distributed detection, Function optimization, Optimal hypothesis testing, Statistical inference","In distributed detection, there does not exist an automatic way of generating optimal decision strategies for non-affine decision functions. Consequently, in a detection problem based on a non-affine decision function, establishing optimality of a given decision strategy, such as a generalized likelihood ratio test, is often difficult or even impossible.In this thesis we develop a novel detection network optimization technique that can be used to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in distributed detection for which the underlying objective function is monotonic and convex in probabilistic decision strategies. Our developed approach leverages on basic concepts of optimization and statistical inference which are provided in appendices in sufficient detail. These basic concepts are combined to form the basis of an optimal inference technique for signal detection.We prove a central theorem that characterizes optimality in a variety of distributed detection architectures. We discuss three applications of this result in distributed signal detection. These applications include interactive distributed detection, optimal tandem fusion architecture, and distributed detection by acyclic graph networks. In the conclusion we indicate several future research directions, which include possible generalizations of our optimization method and new research problems arising from each of the three applications considered."
etd_37,Optimized Integration of Electric Vehicles into Smart Grid,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"electric vehicle, optimization, smart grid","Electric Vehicles (EVs) are considered as a promising solution for the current fossil-based energy shortage and pollutant emission problems. Batteries in EVs not only can support daily commute of EV customers, but can also provide flexible charging rates and storage capabilities that can be effectively harnessed by the power grid when EVs are integrated into the grid. To maximize the benefits of using EVs, regulated and optimized charging control needs to be provided by load aggregators for connected vehicles. An EV charging network is a typical cyber-physical system, which includes a power grid and a large number of EVs as well as aggregators that collect information and control the charging procedure. The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) that are currently under development for future smart grid systems can enable load aggregators to have bidirectional communications with both the grid and EVs to obtain real-time price and load information, and to adjust EV charging schedules in real time.A framework based on EV aggregation for implementing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration is presented in the dissertation. The framework supports the effectiveness of EV aggregation while keeping the information of each EV unrevealed to the grid. The characteristics of EV battery and energy market are analyzed to provide the basis for determining which services that EVs can provide to the grid. We deploy a probabilistic modeling approach to take into consideration the variability associated with the behavior of the EVs.In this dissertation, we comprehensively investigate EV charging scheduling prob- lems for the provision of various scenarios: EV supporting system frequency regulation while satisfying customers' demand, EV trading in multi-settlement energy market, EV improving renewable energy efficiency and EV smoothing renewable power output. We set the objective as to maximize the benefit regarding EV integration to the grid by jointly considering the EV battery constraints, customers' demands and system constraints. In addition, we present a communication protocol for interactions among different entities regarding EV integration, and demonstrate how to integrate the proposed scheduling approach in real-time charging operations.To achieve our goals, we formulate our schemes based on the following problem solving techniques: Linear Programming (LP), Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), heuristic algorithm based LP rounding, Lyapunov optimization and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to provide optimal solutions. Extensive simulation results based on real data are presented to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and to show how several key parameters affect their performance.A framework based on EV aggregation for implementing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration is presented in the dissertation.

etd_398,Optimizing Acyclic Identification of Aptamers,Chemistry,"aptamer, high throughput sequencing, SELEX, thrombin binding aptamer","The minimal human alpha-thrombin binding aptamer, d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG), has previously been successfully identified from a DNA library of randomized hairpin loop, m=15, with the High Throughput Screening of Aptamers (HTSA) technique, later termed Acyclic Identification of Aptamers (AIA). AIA eliminated the need for multiple cycles of in vitro evolution typically used for aptamer discovery by employing libraries with an over-representation of all possible sequences and high throughput sequencing. Although the method was successful at identifying the thrombin binding aptamer, improvements to partitioning and sample preparation inconsistencies encountered during replication attempts were necessary in order to maximize its value. Subsequent revisions and variations of the protocol improved and streamlined the work-flow such that the thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) and multiple variants were identified as high affinity sequences using the ligation based m=15 DNA hairpin loop library mentioned above. The revised AIA protocol was also successful for identifying TBA and multiple variants in a nuclease resistant, modified 2’-OMe RNA/DNA chimera library.  Sample throughput was increased with the introduction of indexed adapters containing sequence “barcodes” that facilitate multiplexing during high throughput sequencing.  To eliminate the constraints of the hairpin loop library structure, a library based on direct amplification, the “adapter” library was designed. The m=15 DNA and m=15 2’-OMe RNA/DNA chimera adapter libraries were unsuccessful at identifying TBA from the library pool, likely due to interference from the flanking adapter regions required for PCR amplification.  A secondary PCR product identified during sample work-up was also characterized. This prompted a significant interest in creating the ability to accurately assess whether or not a sample should be sequenced prior to consuming valuable resources. To accomplish this, the capture of a minimally flanked library (pACAC-m15-CACA) with full length adapters and no requirement for amplification was optimized. The library provides greater flexibility in secondary structure formation and was shown to successfully identify TBA from an over-represented library pool. Amplification-free AIA introduced the unique ability to predict relative maximum sequence frequencies based on the quantity of recovered library, initial degree of over-representation, and anticipated data output. The ability to predict whether or not a sequence could be counted above background was used to assess whether that sample would be sequenced, ultimately saving time and money. To expand the applicability of the tailed libraries and amplification free protocol, a novel partitioning method that eliminated the requirement for protein immobilization was developed. Reversible formaldehyde cross-linking in conjunction with Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay was used to successfully identify TBA above background in proof of concept experiments using amplification free sample preparation. The ability to perform AIA partitioning in solution provides greater flexibility in target selection, including mixtures of proteins. The method also effectively reduces the aptamer off-rate to zero by covalently linking high and moderate affinity sequences to the protein target during selection, an advantage over protein immobilization for partitioning where loss of some DNA from a reversibly bound complex is inevitable. The sample preparation techniques that evolved over the course of this work offer superior control and predictability in the outcome of high throughput sequencing data. This was aided by absolute quantification with qPCR CopyCountTM software that effectively improved library quantification, distribution of indices, and cluster quality, which is crucial for maximization of data output on Illumina sequencing platforms. Consistent, high quality data eliminates the potential for costly resequencing. Future experiments will capitalize on the breadth of improvements to the AIA method described in this work."
fin_etd_11,Option Market Activity around Corporate Events,Finance,"Acquisitions, Mergers, Open interest, Option volume, O/S, Seasoned equity offerings","This dissertation is composed of two papers. In the first paper, I examine the behavior of target firms' option-to-stock volume ratio (O/S) in the time surrounding an acquisition announcement. I find that a high option-to-stock volume ratio (O/S) is a significant indicator that a firm will become a takeover target. The magnitude with which O/S predicts takeover targets is smaller after the enactment of Regulation Fair Disclosure, which sought to reduce selective disclosure of nonpublic information prior to a material corporate event. A target firm's O/S begins to increase as early as the 51 to 100 trading days prior to the announcement, continues to increase as the announcement approaches, and then declines following the announcement. This evidence is consistent with informed traders trading more in the option market than the equity market.In the second paper of this dissertation, I examine option open interest around seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). I find that deviations in option open interest are predictive of future SEO filings. Open interest deviations are positively related to the likelihood of a future SEO as early as 51 to 100 trading days prior to the SEO filing date, and this relationship becomes stronger as the date of the SEO filing approaches. Furthermore, open interest deviations are significantly related to the negative announcement period abnormal returns associated with SEOs. This evidence implies that option markets contain information about future stock price movements prior to major corporate events."

With nearly 400 million adults worldwide considered obese, these positive effects have sparked an increased interest in hPYY(3-36) research, including release profiles, receptor targets, and medicinal applications. A major area of interest is oral delivery of hPYY(3-36) that can display clinically relevant weight-loss outcomes in what would be a highly patient compliant route. The vitamin B12 (B12) pathway has already been successfully used for oral delivery of other peptides including erythropoietin and insulin, but the quantity delivered has been below clinically relevant levels. Herein, we present synthesis, purification, characterization, and clinically relevant in vivo oral delivery of B12-hPYY(3-36) conjugates.The hPYY(3-36) sequence was modified at the N terminus with an octahistidine tag and factor Xa protease sequence along with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) tag and expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified with a yield of 30 ± 7 mg/L. The SUMO-tagged hPYY(3-36) was digested with two different proteases to return either His-tagged hPYY(3-36) or unmodified hPYY(3-36) that were subsequently purified and characterized."
psy_etd_174,Output Interference and Strength Based Mirror Effect in Recognition Memory,Psychology,"Diffusion Model, Memory Models, Output Interference, Recognition Memory","The strength based mirror effect (SBME) refers to higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates for strongly encoded items. The SBME has been explained by two alternative mechanisms: differentiation and criterion shift. The differentiation account posits that as the memory traces are strengthened, the memory for the items is less noisy and therefore are less confusable with the stored memory traces. The criterion shift account, on the other hand, suggests that the tendency to endorse a test item differs between strong and weak test lists. When participants receive a test after studying a strong list of items, they require more evidence to endorse an item. This account suggests that the SBME is observed due to the decision processes rather than memory. One strong piece of evidence for the criterion shift account is that the SBME is observed after studying a mixed list in which half of the items are strengthened and the other half are not. The differentiation mechanism can not account for the SBME observed after a mixed study list. However, recent findings of output interference (OI) in recognition memory have been explained by encoding at retrieval, which suggest that differentiation can also take place at retrieval. This suggests a third possible explanation for the SBME might be encoding during retrieval. In a series of experiments, we investigated the effect of strengthening items at study on OI in pure and mixed list paradigms. The results from the pure list paradigm (Experiment 1) showed both OI and the SBME as well as an interaction between OI and the SBME, as the item-noise models predicted. The results from the mixed list paradigm (Experiment 2-4) showed that the SBME was observed only when participants were informed of the strength of the list that they would be tested on. This finding adds constraints to the criterion shift account which states that participants shift their criterion to endorse a test item according to the type of the test list and that shift in the criterion causes the SBME. These results suggest that both criterion shift and differentiation account could be playing a role in the SBME after studying pure lists, and that only criterion shift account plays a role in SBME after studying a mixed list, but only when participants are explicitly aware of the testing conditions."
etd_489,Output Interference and Testing Effects in Recognition Memory,Psychology,"episodic memory, memory, output interference, recognition, recognition memory, testing effects","Output interference and testing effects are two common occurrences in episodic memory data.  Output interference is the finding that as a recognition memory test increases in length, performance tends to decrease.  This suggests that continued testing is detrimental to recognition memory.  Testing effects are the general finding that repeatedly taking a test contributes to better long-term retention than repeated studying (re-reading) of the same material.   This implies that practicing taking a test is beneficial to the retention and future retrieval of that information.  However, there are no studies that examine both output interference and testing effects.  The current study sought to test recognition memory under conditions that were conducive to both output interference and testing effects.  All participants studied a list of words.  Participants in the study condition then studied the list again and came back for a second appointment where they completed a recognition memory test on the words.  Participants in the test condition took a recognition memory test after studying the words once.  They then took the test again when they came back for the second appointment.  Additionally, participants were either in the repeated or non-repeated targets condition.  In the repeated target condition the words were repeated across all three list.  In the non-repeated target condition, the words on the final test were only shown on the initial study list and not in the intermediary study list or test.  The results showed that there were no significant differences in slope (performance on the final test over test block) between the study and test conditions and the repeated and non-repeated conditions.  There was also not a significant interaction.  Additionally there was not a significant difference in test accuracy between the study and test conditions.  However, accuracy was significantly greater in the repeated condition than the non-repeated condition and there was a significant interaction.  Post-hoc t-tests showed that, within the repeated targets condition, the test condition was significantly more accurate than the study condition.  There was not a significant difference in the non-repeated condition.  These results suggest that repeated testing does not seem to affect output interference and seems to be beneficial when items are encountered more than once but not when they are encountered only once."
etd_699,Over the hurdle: A quantitative study examining the obstacles of achieving professional certification and the perceived effective practices for overcoming them,School of Information Studies,"Information Studies, Professional Certification, Project Management","The purpose of this study was to identify the issues that Information Systems (IS) professionals face when pursuing professional certification as well as the perceived effective practices to overcome these issues. I have observed many students seeking professional certification while only a small subset achieves it. This document provides a review of relevant literature on the topic of professional certification and a research study that examined why some IS professionals achieve this certification and what obstacles they overcame to do so.  The study has relevance to organizations that offer professional certifications, those firms who offer exam preparation for these certifications, and individuals seeking the certification. A review of the literature found no study matching these research questions so a desired outcome of this study was to determine perceived effective practices that could assist the certification process for both professionals and professional certification organizations.  Findings suggest a number of possible strategies that could assist certifying entities, training organizations, employers, and individuals pursuing certification.  As certification becomes increasingly important for success in the workplace, more research is needed in order to build out a support system that enables adult learner success in this particular non-traditional setting."
etd_544,Pain-Related Anxiety as a Predictor of Early Lapse and Relapse to Cigarette Smoking,Psychology,"Cessation, Pain, Pain-related anxiety, Smoking, Tobacco","Pain-related anxiety has been positively associated with tobacco dependence, smoking motives, self-reported barriers to smoking cessation, and expectancies for negative affect reduction via smoking. Although emerging research suggests that pain-related anxiety may play a role in the maintenance of tobacco dependence, no previous work has examined pain-related anxiety as a predictor of smoking cessation outcomes. The goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis that pain-related anxiety would predict early lapse and relapse to cigarette smoking among a sample of 55 daily tobacco smokers who participated in an unaided cessation attempt (i.e., without psychosocial or pharmacological intervention). Pain-related anxiety was assessed at baseline using the PASS-20, which yields a total score that ranges from 0-100. Number of days to early lapse (i.e., any instance of smoking during the first 14 days post-quit) and early relapse (i.e., 7 consecutive days of smoking that began during the first 28 days post-quit) were assessed using timeline follow-back procedures. Cox regression analyses indicated that pain-related anxiety was a significant predictor of both early smoking lapse and relapse, such that for every one point increase on the PASS-20, the risk of early lapse increased by 3.7% and the risk of early relapse increased by 3.6%. These effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by tobacco dependence, past four-week pain severity, anxiety sensitivity, and the presence of current Axis I psychopathology. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses further revealed that among early lapsers, greater pain-related anxiety predicted a more rapid trajectory to lapse. Pain-related anxiety was also shown to be a significant predictor of early lapse when the sample was limited to smokers who endorsed past four-week pain. These findings lend support to the notion that pain-related anxiety may contribute to the maintenance of tobacco dependence among smokers who experience varying levels of pain intensity."
hst_etd_98,"Paper Towns: Sense of Place in Industrial, Small-Town New England, 1869-1927",History,"History of Technology, Local History, Organized Labor, Paper Making, Photography, Small town New England","After the Civil War, new technologies and business structures transformed the American economy and society. One area that has received much attention in the antebellum period but much less after the Civil War, is small town New England. In the late 1860s, the introduction of wood pulp paper technology transformed formerly small market and manufacturing communities into centers of heavy industry. This dissertation is a study of this transformation. It focuses on three communities: Bellows Falls, Vermont, Franklin, New Hampshire, and Turners Falls, Massachusetts.This study examines four broad areas: the historical background of the towns, and townspeople's awareness of their place in local history; the changing technology of woodpulp paper production and the growth of industry in the towns; the daily life of the towns when they were at their most prosperous; and finally the long period of decline of the communities after consolidation of the mills into the International Paper Company in 1898.My chief interest is in how people experienced the world around them--their senses of place. If the Gilded Age and Progressive eras were periods in which American society became increasingly centralized, this study examines that centralization from the periphery rather than the center. Townspeople were keen observers and participants, and their engagement made the communities vibrant places. Thus, local history was not simply an antiquarian diversion, but was essential to the construction of a sense of place. Similarly, the appreciation of the sublime helped give meaning to shared experiences. An important way townspeople viewed their communities was with view photography--stereographs in the nineteenth century and real photo postcards in the twentieth.The paper towns were at their peak when their mills were independent. The economic crisis of the 1890s had a dramatic impact on the towns. Business leaders sought to foster local development, and workers sought to protect their interests by organizing labor unions. Indeed, after 1900, the dominant story of the towns becomes one of organized labor. The final crisis for the towns was in the 1920s, as developers to develop hydroelectric power, and a bitter strike closed the mills."
etd_156,Paradoxically Progressive: The Red Progressives and the Creation of a Modern Native American Subjectivity,English,"Charles Eastman, Francis La Flesche, Genre, Native American, Progressive, Zitkala-Sa","Tracing the complex and contradictory construction of a modern Native American subjectivity through the autobiographical texts of the Red Progressive writers Francis La Flesche, Charles A. Eastman, and Zitkala-a, this dissertation examines how these writers strategically manipulate familiar Euro-American genres as they weave their autobiographies into the boys-book tales, outdoor educational guides, and progressive journalism of the early twentieth century. Their use of genre hybridity establishes an indigenous literary space that confirms Native American humanity and presents counter-narratives to the ""vanishing Indian"" model of assimilation in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. This dissertation argues that La Flesche, Eastman, and Zitkala-a reframe Native American subjectivity by placing it where American educational practices, national anxieties over white masculinity, and progressive era social reform converge. The study illustrates how these broader social and cultural confluences paradoxically enable these Red Progressive writers to resist the long history of non-native representations of Indians and to self-determine a modern subjectivity predicated on an enduring indigenous self that engages with contemporary modernity to disrupt the white mainstream cultural expectations for Native assimilation. Though emphasizing Native American subjectivity, this dissertation engages the complexities of American ethnic identity construction in the past and the present by demonstrating the productive potential of the paradoxes inherent in the very notion of an ""American"" subjectivity."
etd_588,PARAMETERS THAT AFFECT PARALLEL PROCESSING FOR COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETIC SIMULATION CODES ON HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING CLUSTERS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Computational Electromagnetics,"What is the impact of multicore and associated advanced technologies on computational software for science? Most researchers and students have multicore laptops or desktops for their research and they need computing power to run computational software packages. Computing power was initially derived from Central Processing Unit (CPU) clock speed. That changed when increases in clock speed became constrained by power requirements. Chip manufacturers turned to multicore CPU architectures and associated technological advancements to create the CPUs for the future. Most software applications benefited by the increased computing power the same way that increases in clock speed helped applications run faster. However, for Computational ElectroMagnetics (CEM) software developers, this change was not an obvious benefit – it appeared to be a detriment. Developers were challenged to find a way to correctly utilize the advancements in hardware so that their codes could benefit. The solution was parallelization and this dissertation details the investigation to address these challenges.Prior to multicore CPUs, advanced computer technologies were compared with the performance using benchmark software and the metric was FLoting-point Operations Per Seconds (FLOPS) which indicates system performance for scientific applications that make heavy use of floating-point calculations. Is FLOPS an effective metric for parallelized CEM simulation tools on new multicore system? Parallel CEM software needs to be benchmarked not only by FLOPS but also by the performance of other parameters related to type and utilization of the hardware, such as CPU, Random Access Memory (RAM), hard disk, network, etc. The codes need to be optimized for more than just FLOPs and new parameters must be included in benchmarking.In this dissertation, the parallel CEM software named High Order Basis Based Integral Equation Solver (HOBBIES) is introduced. This code was developed to address the needs of the changing computer hardware platforms in order to provide fast, accurate and efficient solutions to large, complex electromagnetic problems. The research in this dissertation proves that the performance of parallel code is intimately related to the configuration of the computer hardware and can be maximized for different hardware platforms. To benchmark and optimize the performance of parallel CEM software, a variety of large, complex projects are created and executed on a variety of computer platforms. The computer platforms used in this research are detailed in this dissertation. The projects run as benchmarks are also described in detail and results are presented. The parameters that affect parallel CEM software on High Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC) are investigated. This research demonstrates methods to maximize the performance of parallel CEM software code."

Few studies, however, have been conducted to understand people’s attitudes toward this population and factors that affect the responses. Applying the Parasocial Contact Hypothesis (Schiappa, Gregg & Hewes, 2005), this thesis investigated the relationship between audiences’ positive and negative parasocial relationships with transgender characters in TV and their attitudes toward transgender people in real life. A survey method was employed to address research questions and test hypothesis. Results show a significant association between parasocial relationship (positive or negative) and attitudes toward trans people in real life. Parasocial relationship was also found to have mediating and interactive effects on the relationship between perceived realism of characters and attitudes toward transgender population. Finally, it was also suggested that positive parasocial relationship with comedy characters is a stronger predictor of attitudes than with non-comedy characters. Contribution, limitation and implications were also discussed."
cfs_etd_69,Parent Aggression and Youth Externalizing and Internalizing Behaviors: Stability and Mutual Influence,Child and Family Studies,"adolescents, corporal punishment, emotional aggression, externalizing, internalizing, parent aggression","Parent aggression exists on a continuum with corporal punishment at one end and abuse at the other. There is still controversy as to whether any kind of parent aggression toward an adolescent contributes to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Relative to what is known about parent aggression during childhood, much less is known about parent aggression toward adolescents from a systemic and developmental perspective. This study explored the stability and mutual influence of parent aggression and adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors. The study found that the constructs were stable over time, and that with this sample population, parental physical and emotional aggression co-occurred with internalizing and externalizing behaviors at both points in time. Neither form of parent aggression showed a longitudinal association with youth externalizing or internalizing behaviors. The current study found a mutual influence between parent aggression and youth maladaptive behaviors, thus adding to the growing but limited literature considering both directions of influence. Finally, the study found a temporal association between the quality of relationships with family at T1 and youth internalizing behaviors at T1 and T2, suggesting that family relationships remain important predictors of adolescent emotional wellbeing."
etd_333,"Parent-Child Communication among African American Families: Does ""Being on the Same Page"" Protect Against Adolescent Sexual Risk Behavior?",Psychology,"adolescents, African American, communication, sexual risk behavior","African American adolescents continue to be at high risk for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sexual risk reduction efforts have focused on family-level sexual health communication, although they have yielded inconsistent findings. Using dyadic data from African American parents and their children (n= 298), the present study sought to elucidate the influence of sexual health communication on adolescent sexual behavior. Findings confirmed that adolescent reports of family-level sex communication were associated with greater sexual involvement, whereas parent reports of sexual health communication showed no associations to child sexual behavior. Including parent reports of communication did not enhance predictive models of adolescent sexual behavior beyond the variance explained by adolescent report. Congruence between parent and adolescent reports of sexual health communication was only moderate in the current sample. Further, communication report congruence moderated the association between communication and adolescent sexual risk. Among participants showing high congruence, sexual health communication was positively associated with adolescent condom use. Findings suggest that relational characteristics may influence the extent to which family-level sex communication is associated with sexual risk reduction and affirm the importance of family-level research as one approach to improving sexual health among African American youth."
etd_616,"Parenting Styles, Effortful Control, and Academic Outcomes among Chinese Adolescents: The Mediating Effect of Activation Control",Child and Family Studies,"academic outcomes, Chinese adolescents, effortful control, parenting","The present study examined the associations between parenting styles and adolescents’ academic performance, with a specific focus on examining the mediating role of activation control among Chinese adolescents. A framework of Chinese parenting style, which consists of three dimensions, rejection, emotional warmth, and over-protection, was utilized to predict activation control and academic outcomes. Structural models were fitted with the data collected from a Chinese sample of adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. Parenting styles were found to be associated with children’s activation control skills and academic outcomes. Activation control skills were found to be beneficial for promoting educational attainment expectation and reducing school work difficulties. The present study also indicates that in some cases activation control mediates the association between parental over-protection and experiencing school work difficulties. The findings of the present study reinforce previous research by demonstrating the importance of Chinese-specific parenting approaches and by identifying the importance of activation control in the Chinese cultural context."

It asked: 1) What are the perspectives of such parents on the literacy instruction offered to their children?, and 2) What are the perspectives of such parents on the opportunities available to them to participate in decision-making about this literacy instruction?This study was grounded in disability studies and critical interpretivist frameworks, which provided a lens for understanding participants' views in the context of our society's historically unjust treatment of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Data sources included transcripts from in-depth semi-structured interviews, which I analyzed using Weft-QDA software and the constant comparison method to identify themes within and across the interviews.A number of themes emerged from the analysis. Parents' perspectives on the literacy instruction received by their children varied on a continuum that ranged from pleased to exceedingly dissatisfied. In the parents' views, teacher investment in the children's learning and the settings in which the children were instructed were important. In addition, when interacting with their children's schools regarding this instruction, the participants reported engaging in various styles of communication, holding different viewpoints and experiencing a number of emotions, styles I described as Present Listening, Emergent Advocacy, and Steadfast Advocacy. These findings have implications for school professionals, teacher education programs, and researchers who are interested in developing mechanisms for drawing on parents' insights as they orchestrate literacy instruction for such children."
phy_etd_130,Particle Physics in the LHC Era,Physics,"Beyond Standard Model, composite Higgs, extra dimensions, particle physics, phenomonology","During the past 100 years experimental particle physicists have collected an impressive amount of data. Theorists have also come to understand this data extremely well. It was in the first half of the 20th century the efforts of the early pioneers of quantum mechanics laid the ground work for this understanding: quantum field theory. Through the tireless efforts of researchers during the later half of the 20th century many ideas came together to form what we now call the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Finally, it was through the ideas of the renormalization group and effective field theory that the understanding of how the SM fits into a larger framework of particle physics was crystallized.In the past four years the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has made more precise measurements than ever before. Currently the SM of particle physics is known to have excellent agreement with these measurements. As a result of this agreement with data, the SM continues to play such a central role in modern particle physics that many other theories are simply known as `Beyond the Standard Model' (BSM) as we know any new models will simply be an extension of the SM.Despite agreement with experiment, the SM does suffer from several shortcomings that raise deeper questions. In this dissertation we study models that address the two of the outstanding theoretical problems of the SM - the Strong CP Problem and the fine tuning of the Higgs mass. We study models that solve or ameliorate these problems, and their implications for collider physics and astrophysics."
etd_533,Patient Sociotechnical Assemblages: The Distributed Cognition of Health Information Management,School of Information Studies,"Distributed Cognition, Personal Health Information Management, Personal Health Records, Practice Theory, Sociotechnical Assemblage","Personal health records (PHR) are shifting the capabilities and responsibilities of both patients and providers. Influenced by health IT, concepts like patient-centered care, meaningful use, and patient empowerment are commonplace in the healthcare system. As the popularity of personal health records increases, medical providers, healthcare organizations, and health information system stakeholders require a thorough understanding of how patients use these patient facing information portals in conjunction with other artifacts, objects, and practices to manage and maintain their health.Exploring health information management as a distributed sociotechnical assemblage is the conceptual approach of this research. A distributed cognition perspective lends insight to drawing boundaries and establishing connections of personal health information management practices in conjunction with PHR use. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides a unique setting to further understand PHR use and personal health information management practice through the observation of U.S. military veterans enrolled in the My HealtheVet PHR. This context and conceptual framework lead to the research questions for the proposed study:RQ1a: What are the personal health information management practices of veterans who use a personal health record?RQ1b: What health information management practices become distributed beyond the veteran patient?RQ2a: What health information management assemblages emerge from the distributed work of Veterans that use a personal health record?RQ2b: What are key functions of the health information management assemblages of veterans?Through the use of semi-structured in depth interviews, observations, and surveys, data were collected on 22 patients along with their primary care providers and caretakers. Results from a two cycle qualitative coding analysis and analytical cognitive mapping technique reveal bundles of practices for creating reminders, organizing information, and creating information for asking questions and working with primary care providers. Distributed practices emerged that detail the managing of medication, information that is socially distributed, and patient-provider communication through secure messaging. Three health information management assemblage components emerged from the analysis: health events and experiential information, information techniques, and technology and material practices. Each of these components is understood by the ways they become stabilized or destabilized. This research contributes to implications for the design of patient-focused personal health records and informs clinical practice of patient-centered care. The research also makes conceptual and empirical contributions to the practice of health information management and a patient-centered care model of healthcare delivery."
etd_91,PATTERNED BIOFILM FORMATION TO INVESTIGATE BACTERIA-SURFACE INTERACTIONS,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Bacterial-surface interaction, Biofilm heterogeneity, High drug resistance, Patterned biofilm, Surface chemistry, Surface topography","Bacterial adhesion to surfaces and subsequent formation of microcolonies play important roles in biofilm formation, which is a major cause of chronic infections and persistent biofouling. Despite the significance, mechanistic understanding of biofilm formation is still hindered by the structural heterogeneity in biofilms; and effective control of biofilm formation remains challenging. Biofilm formation is a dynamic process that involves numerous changes in bacterial gene and protein expression. These changes are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as surface chemistry, topography, charge, and hydrophobicity. To better control biofilm morphology and specifically investigate the effects of these factors, a platform was developed in this study to obtain patterned biofilm formation using surfaces with well-defined patterns of chemistry and topography.By modifying surfaces with systematically varied square patterns of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of functional alkanthiols, the size of cell clusters and inter-cluster distance were well controlled. By following biofilm formation of Escherichia coli on these surfaces, it was found that multicellular connections were formed between adjacent cell clusters when the clusters were within a threshold distance (10 µm); and such connections were influenced by the size of interacting cell clusters. It was also found that the connections were formed by active interactions of cell clusters, rather than nonspecific binding of planktonic cells on the bioinert background. Interestingly, the mutants of luxS and motB exhibited major defects in interaction between cell clusters. The phenotype of the luxS mutant was successfully restored by both complementing the luxS gene on a plasmid and by adding the precursor of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signal in the culture. These results suggest that AI-2 mediated quorum sensing and motility are involved in the interaction among cell clusters. Based on these findings, a model was proposed to explain the intrinsic heterogeneity in biofilm structures. Consistently, cells attached between interacting clusters were found to be more sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin.Besides surfaces with patterns of surface chemistry, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces with microtopographic patterns of different shapes, dimensions and inter-pattern distances were used to understand the effects of surface topography on bacteria-surface interactions and biofilm formation. E. coli was found to preferentially attach and form biofilms in the valleys between square shaped plateaus. In addition, there appeared to be a threshold dimension of a plateau to allow bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on top of the plateaus. The threshold was found to be 40 µm × 40 µm for inverted patterns used in this study. Inspired by this finding, we created PDMS surfaces with hexagon shaped patterns and found that the ones with 15 µm side width and 2 µm inter-pattern distance can reduce biofilm formation by 7-fold compared to flat PDMS surfaces.These results were integrated with additional tests to better understand the resistance of biofilm cells to antibiotics. Specifically, the biofilm formation of fluorescently labeled donors and recipients on PDMS surfaces with square shaped microtopographic patterns was followed to investigate the effects of cell density on bacterial conjugation. PDMS surfaces with microtopogrpahic patterns were found to promote both biofilm formation and bacterial conjugation. This result was found to be due to the aggregation of biofilm cells on the side of plateaus, providing ""hot spots"" for bacterial conjugation. Bacterial motility was also found to play an important role in biofilm formation and bacterial conjugation. Collectively, these results are helpful for understanding the mechanism of biofilm formation and associated drug resistance, as well as the design of nonfouling surfaces."
etd_568,Patterns in the Concentration and Transport of Nutrients and Major Elements in the Watersheds and Embayments of Lake Ontario: a Landscape Perspective,Civil and Environmental Engineering,,"Lake Ontario embayments were studied in a National Science Foundation (NSF) Biocomplexity Project to understand factors controlling the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems associated with Lake Ontario.  Eight embayments of Lake Ontario and associated watersheds were selected to examine how the linkages between upland watersheds and Lake Ontario control the inputs and function of interconnected open freshwater embayments ecosystems. In this study, water samples were collected monthly from the eight Lake Ontario embayments, and 22 tributary sites in the associated sub-watersheds and Lake Ontario. Supporting hydrologic measurements were also made over the period 2001-2003. These data were used to examine water quality patterns in the upland, tributaries and embayments. Samples were analyzed for nutrients and major solutes.The land cover of the sub-watersheds was varied, but largely a mixture of forest and agricultural lands.  Tributaries draining largely agricultural lands exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, particularly for nutrients.  Nitrate and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were generally low during the summer growing season; concentrations increased markedly during fall and decreased during winter and spring. Total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and major ion (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-) concentrations varied with seasonal discharge patterns.Distinct spatial patterns in tributary solute concentrations were observed that closely corresponded with land use.  Solute concentrations increased markedly with increases in the percentage of the watershed occurring as agricultural land.  Such a pattern has been commonly observed for nutrients (e.g., TP, TN, NO3- , DOC), but this relationship was also strongly evident for many non-nutrient solutes (e.g., F-, SO42-).  These observations suggest that agricultural activities mobilize most elements and greatly enhance transport across the temperate landscape impacting surface water resources.The coastal embayments of Lake Ontario obtain their water from upland watershed drainage, direct precipitation and mixing with Lake Ontario. A 3-end member mixing analysis was applied using fluoride as the conservative solute to study the mixing patterns for the embayment ecosystems. Results indicated that more than 60% of waters were derived from the adjacent watershed in most embayments annually. However, more than 90% of water in Little Sodus was derived from Lake Ontario. Direct precipitation contributed about 10% in some embayments with large surface area. Water residence times were calculated in a range between less than 1 day in Floodwood to 148 days for South Sandy Pond using the 3-end member mixing model. Seasonal variations in the source of water to Lake Ontario embayments were observed, with watershed discharge dominating in spring and Lake Ontario inputs increasing during the low flow summer period.  Significant contributions from direct precipitation occurred in late summer and early fall, coinciding with low watershed inputs.The embayment ecosystems receive nutrient inputs from upland watersheds and water exchange with Lake Ontario, and undergo biogeochemical processes through internal nutrient cycles simultaneously.  Regression analyses suggested that upland watersheds played important roles in TN and DOC dynamics in the study embayments. A positive correlation between TP and density of residences adjacent to the embayments may reflect the release of TP from lawn or garden fertilizers and septic tanks contributing to TP input to embayments. Mass balance calculations suggested that internal processes within embayments play important roles for some nutrient dynamics. For example, study embayments acted as sinks for dissolved silica and nitrate, but a source for ammonium.Watershed runoff and inflow from Lake Ontario transported acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) into embayment ecosystems. Mass balance models for dissolved inorganic carbon, ANC and particulate carbon were developed to improve understanding of the carbon cycle in the linked freshwater ecosystems. Regression analysis indicated that watersheds with considerable agricultural land use were large sources of ANC in stream discharge, and internal biogeochemical processes contributed to changes in ANC in the embayments with longer water residence times. Both mineral saturation index and mass balance calculations indicated the potential for CaCO3 precipitation, suggesting that embayment ecosystems could be terrestrial sinks of inorganic carbon. Also, retention of SO42- and NO3- can contribute to production of ANC within embayments."
etd_386,"PEDAGOGY, SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION, AND SPACE: TOWARD A REVOLUTIONARY CRITICAL PEDAGOGY FOR SPACE",Cultural Foundations of Education,"critical pedagogy, educational theory, Henri Lefebvre, Marxism, philosophy of education, space","Building on the work of Peter McLaren, Henri Lefebvre, and David Harvey, this dissertation develops a revolutionary critical pedagogy for space. I begin with a historical and theoretical survey of the roots critical pedagogy, a pedagogical orientation that is often called upon but rarely situated deeply. I then break down revolutionary critical pedagogy into seven components. I elaborate the dominant trends in the current social-political moment. I introduce two terms here, neoliberalism and the global class war. I argue that the former is a necessary but ultimately insufficient framework for understanding the present moment, and that the latter provides a necessary supplement because it looks at the global project of the restoration of capitalist class power after the circuit of socialist and national liberation struggles that transformed the globe between 1945-1979. This all entails an emphasis on the level of the global, but why is it that the global is so important, let alone space? I turn to these questions next, bringing in the “spatial turn” in education. I situate this work within the overall development of capitalism. I next turn to a particularly important spatial formation in the present: the city. Cities, I argue, are where the global contradictions of capitalism are most acute and concentrated; where capitalism is most vulnerable to disruption and overthrow. I bring in political movements and research on the “right to the city” as one way that revolutionary critical pedagogy can seize on such vulnerability. Finally, I return to the question of “pedagogy,” a move that not only spatializes educational theory but also educationalizes spatial theory. I do this by focusing in on Lefebvre’s theorization of the production of space as a revolutionary activity and his spatial framework of 1) representations of space; 2) representational spaces; and 3) spatial practice. I augment this framework with an educational triad of 1) learning; 2) studying; and 3) teaching. Claiming that this triad needs to be held in a precarious and dialectic relation, I read this triad through two pedagogical examples: the schoolhouse as curriculum and the 2015 Baltimore Rebellion as praxis."

This investigation also explored peer leaders' perceptions of their critical thinking skills. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test with control group design was used to determine critical thinking gains in PLTL/non-PLTL groups.Critical thinking was assessed using the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) among participants who had previously completed and been successful in the second semester of a two-semester introductory biology course sequence. Qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires confirmed that factors thought to improve critical thinking skills such as interaction with peers, problem solving, and discussion were perceived by participants to have an impact on critical thinking gains. However, no significant quantitative differences in peer leaders' critical thinking skills were found between pre- and post-treatment CCTST measurements nor between experimental and control groups. Additionally, students led by peer leaders attained significantly higher exam and final course grades in introductory biology than similar students not participating in PLTL. Finally, among introductory biology students who opted not to enroll in the associated lab course, those who participated in PLTL averaged more than a letter grade higher than those who did not, and this difference was statistically significant."
etd_45,PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING: NONCOMBATANT MOBILIZATION FOR PEACE IN AFRICA,Political Science,,"During the 1990s and early 2000s, a number of domestic social actors mobilized for peace in several African countries. They did so under unfavorable political conditions. Some of them went further and pursued their objective for peace at the level of formal negotiations. This particularizing inquiry sought to understand the process leading to their engagement with formal negotiations. To achieve this, inquiry focused on two questions: what about the conditions and contexts prevailing in the 1990s to early 2000s accounted for social actor's engagement with formal negotiation processes and how civic groups went about doing so. The main argument was that certain opportunities within the unfavorable political conditions and social actors' understanding of war accounted for the pursuit of peace objectives at the level of formal negotiations. A combination of specific and configurational history strategies were employed to reconstruct the process of engagement and the conditions under which it unfolded. This reconstruction relied on intrinsic and extrinsic analyses of ten peace campaigns led by religious leaders and women organizations that occurred between 1990 and 2005 in Angola, Burundi, Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Somalia. Data on these campaigns was collected through archival research and face to face interviews.  The resulting account suggests that the failure of social actor's humanitarian activities to mitigate the social and economic suffering caused by the war and the failure of formal negotiations to secure a lasting peace led to social actors' pursuit for an end to war. However, to engage with political actors with political, military and economic leverage, social actors had to deploy their social resources creatively to pursue their demands for peace."

I examine the development of his ethics from 1765 through 1791. I contend that the earliest texts express a set of ideas that Herder modified and developed throughout the rest of his work. These are a perfectionist conception of the end of human life, a belief in the centrality of history for ethics, a form of naturalism, and a commitment to the idea that every individual ought to blend their characteristic powers into a harmonious whole.  The study considers a set of texts in chronological order. I begin with an examination of the ideals espoused by Herder in two texts from the 1760s, ""Wie die Philosophie zum Besten des Volks Allgemeiner und Ntzlicher Werden Kann"" and Journal meiner Reise im Jahr 1769. I then look at an exchange of letters between Herder and Moses Mendelssohn concerning the highest good, or vocation of man. I then look at how the ideas sketched in these earlier works were filled out in Abhandlung ber den Ursprung der Sprache (1772), Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit (1774), Vom Erkennen und Empfinden der menschlichen Seele (1774-8), and Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (1784-91)."
etd_24,"Peripheral Knowledge: The Witch, the Magus, and the Mountebank on the Early Modern Stage",English,"Early modern England, Drama","Focusing on the work of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson, and Dekker, my dissertation, Peripheral Knowledge: The Witch, the Magus, and the Mountebank on the Early Modern Stage, argues for a humanist intellectual investment in various forms of liminal knowledge embodied by socially marginalized figures. I read the figures of the witch, the magus and the mountebank as embodying forbidden knowledge, philosophical knowledge, and false knowledge respectively. While humanist philosophers like Ficino and Pico della Mirandola glorified the pursuit of limitless knowledge, humanism itself was grounded within political, legal, religious, and educational institutions, and was invested in maintaining their integrity. In my dissertation, I discuss how categories of marginal knowledge are shaped by the intellectual culture of humanism and the socio-religious context of the Reformation. While knowledge is traditionally constructed as an abstract category, I argue that it is deeply rooted in the material culture and is determined by it. Peripheral Knowledge begins by re-considering theories of historicism and cultural materialism, and examines how historicist accounts are constructed and what kinds of assumptions are made in the process. Though predicated on literary texts, my dissertation follows a historical mode of inquiry, and makes references to a wide range of historical documents, which range from legal treatises and records, pamphlets and ballads, recipe books and books of magic (or grimoires), many of which I have come across during my archival research at the Folger Shakespeare Library.While my dissertation concentrates on early modern literature, the larger issues that it addresses - the exploration of what constitutes legitimate and illicit knowledge, how and why certain forms of knowledge find institutional validation, and how popular literature strikes a balance between the different determinants of knowledge, have a contemporary resonance. Since humanists are our own intellectual predecessors, the present study of the humanities is predicated on the renaissance intellectual enterprise. I understand the current academic debates of Stanley Fish, Michael Berube, and Martha Nussbaum, concerning the relevance of the humanities, as well as the current crisis of the humanities represented by the recently proposed budget cuts to the NEH, as a derivative of similar debates inhering early modern humanism."
etd_366,Permitting Joint-Control in Asymmetric Dependence Relationships: Investigating a Strategy for Increasing Trust,Psychology,"Asymmetric Dependence, Joint-Control, Soliciting Input, Trust","Most work related to trust in dyadic interactions has focused on the establishment and development of trust in situations where partners are of relatively equal status and have the ability to impact each other's outcomes (Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985; for a review Simpson, 2007a; 2007b). However, many social interactions can be characterized as asymmetric dependence situations where the outcomes of one partner (i.e., the dependent partner) are completely controlled by another (i.e., the controlling partner). The current work investigated trust in the context of one-off asymmetric dependence interactions, and experimentally explored one strategy for increasing trust in these exchanges. In Study 1, faith was found to be the component of trust most predictive of trust-based behavior. Additionally, the controlling partner soliciting input from the dependent partner in this type of interaction was found to be associated with increased ratings of faith, when the dependent partner felt like his or her input was taken into account by the controlling partner. Study 2 demonstrated that soliciting input can have an negative effect on faith if the dependent partner's input is not reflected in the controlling partner's decision and no explanation is provided for this decision. Overall, this work suggests the controlling partner soliciting input from the dependent partner can result in increased trust in one-off asymmetric dependence interactions, as long as the dependent partner feels like his or her input was taken into account, and an explanation is provided if his or her input is not reflected in the controlling partner's decision. This work has potential implications for asymmetric dependence relationships encountered outside the laboratory (e.g., patient-provider relationships, salesperson-customer relationships, supervisor-employee relationships)."
etd_646,PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND THREAT: DO THREATENING SITUATIONS HAVE AN EFFECT ON HELPING INTENTIONS AND PERCEIVED EXPECTATIONS?,Psychology,"Challenge and Threat, Gender Disparities, Perspective Taking, Political Differences","An important skill for interpersonal communication is the ability to take the perspective of another person. Taking the perspective of a target can aid the perceiver in predicting the target’s mental states and subsequent behaviors. This can be especially important in threatening situations. How a member of an advantaged group believes that disadvantaged group members will react to a threatening situation may influence the advantaged member’s actions and beliefs. In the first study, female and male participants read information regarding gender while using three perspectives; their own perspective, predicting the other gender’s responses, or imagining their responses if they were the other gender. They estimated their career expectations while using their assigned perspective and their willingness to help women in the workplace while using their own perspective. The second study examined perspective taking in the political context. Participants were presented with a paragraph indicating that Independent voters were either in favor or against their political party. The participants indicated their future life expectations, willingness to compromise with the opposing party, and willingness to help a member of the opposing party. Both studies reported a similar pattern for expectations. Advantaged groups overestimated the negative effects of threat on the disadvantaged group, while disadvantaged groups overestimated the positive effects on the advantaged groups. Perspective taking increased helping intentions in Study 1 and showed mixed results in Study 2. The studies’ results were inconsistent with prior research and suggest that perspective taking may not produce positive results for groups who are disadvantaged."
phy_etd_122,Physics on Noncommutative Spacetimes,,"Fuzzy Sphere, Hopf Algebra, Noncommutative Geometry, Planck Scale Physics, Quantum Field Theory","The structure of spacetime at the Planck scale remains a mystery to this date with a lot of insightful attempts to unravel this puzzle. One such attempt is the proposition of a `pointless' structure for spacetime at this scale. This is done by studying the geometry of the spacetime through a noncommutative algebra of functions defined on it. We call such spacetimes 'noncommutative spacetimes'. This dissertation probes physics on several such spacetimes. These include compact noncommutative spaces called fuzzy spaces and noncompact spacetimes. The compact examples we look at are the fuzzy sphere and the fuzzy Higg's manifold. The noncompact spacetimes we study are the Groenewold-Moyal plane and the Bxn plane.A broad range of physical effects are studied on these exotic spacetimes. We study spin systems on the fuzzy sphere. The construction of Dirac and chirality operators for an arbitrary spin j is studied on both S2/F and S2 in detail. We compute the spectrums of the spin 1 and spin 3/2 Dirac operators on S2/F. These systems have novel thermodynamical properties which have no higher dimensional analogs, making them interesting models.The fuzzy Higg's manifold is found to exhibit topology change, an important property for any theory attempting to quantize gravity. We study how this change occurs in the classical setting and how quantizing this manifold smoothens the classical conical singularity. We also show the construction of the star product on this manifold using coherent states on the noncommutative algebra describing this noncommutative space.On the Moyal plane we develop the LSZ formulation of scalar quantum field theory. We compute scattering amplitudes and remark on renormalization of this theory. We show that the LSZ formalism is equivalent to the interaction representation formalism for computing scattering amplitudes on the Moyal plane. This result is true for on-shell Green's functions and fails to hold for off-shell Green's functions.With the present technology available, there is a scarcity of experiments which directly involve the Planck scale. However there are interesting low and medium energy experiments which put bounds on the validity of established principles which are thought to be violated at the Planck scale. One such principle is the Pauli principle which is expected to be violated on noncommutative spacetimes. We introduce a noncommutative spacetime called the Bxn plane to show how transitions, not obeying the Pauli principle, occur in atomic systems. On confronting with the data from experiments, we place bounds on the noncommutative parameter."
etd_664,Plasma Volume Hematocrit (PVH):  “Big Data” Applied to Physiology Enabled by a New Algorithm,Chemistry,"Big data, Hematocrit, Noninvasive, Physiology, Plasma volume, Raman Spectroscopy","This work describes the ongoing analysis of blood noninvasively in vivo along with the in vitro validation of the algorithm. The blood is taken as two components, red blood cells and plasma, both of which cause elastic emission (from Mie and Rayleigh scattering) and inelastic emission (from fluorescence and Raman emission). The algorithm describes the linear dependence of the volume fractions of both red blood cells and plasma with both the elastic and inelastic emissions where the two equations are independent. These equations are used to calculate the Hematocrit which is defined as the volume fraction of red blood cells in the total volume of blood. We believe that monitoring changes in the Hematocrit with sufficient sensitivity could give information about many physiological parameters including an early indication for internal hemorrhaging. The stability of the baseline was analyzed in 10 test subjects across 29 experiments including over 8 million frames of data to give the smallest physiological increment of ±0.033 Hematocrit units. Compared to the medical standard blood draw method, with a standard deviation of ±2.0 Hematocrit units, our device is 60 times more sensitive to changes in the Hematocrit. Repeating patterns in the Hematocrit can be analyzed by a Fourier transform to give respiration rate and pulse rate earning the title of “big data.” Changes in the Hematocrit were also observed in dialysis patients (where the blood is manually cleaned due to kidney failure) and in a rat model where large portions of the blood can be removed and reintroduced. Blood loss and addition of fluid reveal changes in the Hematocrit that are distinguishable from the baseline. The algorithm was validated by a well-defined in vitro system modeling the blood components. The model demonstrates that an optically thin sample in the linear range produces a good fit by the algorithm. Finally, the blood was analyzed in vitro to demonstrate that the red blood cells and plasma show linearity within the physiological ranges observed in vivo. At 830 nm excitation, the same wavelength used in vivo, volume fractions of red blood cells and plasma at the physiological range demonstrate linearity. All of the experiments and analysis appear to give evidence supporting the measuring of changes in the Hematocrit noninvasively in vivo on a medically useful timescale."
etd_279,Poletsky-Stessin Hardy Spaces on the Unit Disk,Mathematics,Hardy Spaces,"The holomorphic functions on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ have a remarkable property: to know the values of a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{D}$ it suffices to know only its values on the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$. However not all holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{D}$ are defined on $\mathbb{T}$ and the major problem of establishing such values (called boundary values) led to the appearance of Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{D})$, $p\ge1$. If a function lies in a Hardy space then its boundary values can be defined and its values on $\mathbb{D}$ can be obtained using standard Cauchy or Poisson formulas.The theory of Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{D})$ was well developed in the last century and the spaces became the fundamental ground for complex analysis. To create analogous spaces in higher dimensions Poletsky and Stessin introduced new spaces on hyperconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ in \cite{PS}. We call these spaces the Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces. Poletsky and Stessin used them to study composition operators but did not look at their detailed properties.In this thesis we fill this gap studying Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. As in \cite{PS} for their definition we use subharmonic exhaustion functions $u$ and denote these spaces by $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$. It was mentioned in \cite{PS} that the classical Hardy spaces form a subclass of Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces. Our work begins with producing an example that shows that there are subharmonic exhaustion functions $u$ on $\mathbb{D}$ for which the Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$ are different from classical Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{D})$. Thus we have an abundance of new function spaces to be explored.We show that the theory of boundary values for functions in Poletsky--Stessin Hardy  spaces is analogous to the classical theory of Hardy spaces and the most of the classical properties stay true for these new spaces. Since by \cite{PS} the space $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$ lies in $H^p(\mathbb{D})$ we can use the classical boundary values for functions in $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$. This allows us to redefine Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces as spaces whose boundary values belong to weighted $L^p$ spaces on $\mathbb{T}$ and we completely characterize the weights that produce Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$.Many problems in complex analysis ask for existence of a bounded function in some class. Usually it is easier to find a function in $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$ but they are not necessarily bounded. As an application of Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces we provide a reduction of such problems to the existence of a function in $H^p_u(\mathbb{D})$ and use it to give shortcuts in the proofs of the famous interpolation theorem and corona problem.At the end of the thesis we also study the boundary behavior of functions in the Hardy spaces on the polydisk and discuss the intersection of Poletsky--Stessin spaces on bidisk."
wp_etd_32,Political Emotions: Toward a Fresh Perspective on Collective Emotion in Composition Work,Writing Program,"Composition, Emotion, Pedagogy, Politics, Social Justice, Writing","This dissertation examines theories of emotion in politically contentious discourse in order to better understand the implications for teachers and students in composition classrooms where critical pedagogical practices lead to contentious political work. I suggest that partly as a result of the social and political turn in composition studies, the expectation for disrupting the normative political values and beliefs of students has become part of the curriculum in many writing classrooms. Yet teachers and students charged with such learning goals may be largely unaware of and unprepared for the role emotion might play in this teaching and learning situation. I argue that it is both ethically imperative and pragmatically in our best interest to better understand the complexities of the intersection between emotion and politically contentious discourse.Drawing on a variation of grounded theory methodology called ""situational analysis,"" I examine two seemingly separate sites of inquiry, a politically contentious discussion among teachers in composition and rhetoric, and materials from a new teaching assistant practicum, that together help begin to illuminate the less than visible influences and importance of collective emotion in contentious political discourse in the writing classroom. In chapter one I establish the exigency for the project and provide an historical account of the divergent paths that have led to politically contentious discourse in writing classrooms. In chapter two, I develop a working definition for the concept of emotion and suggest particular theoretical frames from political sociology useful to the analysis of emotion. Chapter three provides an explanation and justification for the use of situational analysis as a methodological way forward in exploring relational factors involved in the situation of inquiry. Chapter four analyzes a politically contentious discussion among professionals in composition and rhetoric, which highlights the autonomous power of collective emotion to open and reinforce social division. In chapter five I examine steps that scholars in composition and rhetoric have taken toward understanding the implications of emotion in politically contentious classrooms, and argue that there are important gaps in this work, particularly with regard to the range of experience of the teachers taking on the challenge of critical pedagogy in first year composition. The final chapter examines a particular site of such teaching work, a new teaching assistant practicum, through materials collected retrospectively from teachers, students and mentors. In sum, this dissertation argues for first steps we might take to ensure a more productive way forward for teachers and students in classrooms where politically contentious work is part of the writing curriculum."

The dissertation questions the validity of the term natural through an examination of, both, the long term causes (land administration policies, state issued settlement patterns) and short-term causes (immediate governmental orders and relief measures). It argues, while hazards like cyclones are natural in origin, their effects depend on the socio-economic and political positioning of the human actors. In fact, disasters are often looked upon as ruptures that challenge the basic foundations of societies and thus, act as the catalyst for change.Using two case studies, the Great Backurgunge Cyclone of 1876 and the Bhola Cyclone of 1970, in the sea facing deltaic district of Bakarganj (present day Barisal and Bhola in Bangladesh) it explores the strained relationship between the state and the various political actors after these disasters. While the historical circumstances leading to these disasters differ, as do the results emanating from them, the dissertation argues that these extreme events played a key role in the subsequent political events (the Imperial Assemblage of 1877 and the first General Elections in Pakistan in 1970). Disasters, such as these, provided an opportunity to evaluate the functioning of the state in this peripheral region, exposed not only the lack of intervention on the part of the (colonial and post-colonial) state that resulted in escalating the effects but it also questions the status of the colonial subject and the post-colonial citizen within the framework of the British colonial empire and the post-colonial Pakistani nation-state."

I situate popular creativity and the politics involved in the context of cultural studies.My first case looks at advertisements that are placed under attack, or busted. I investigate the different politics of defamiliarization between two specific busted ads.  The politics of defamiliarization create moving images based on the Freudian uncanny and Brechtian Verfremdung.   My second case involves Harry Potter fans and fan fiction writing. Specifically, I investigate the politics of closure or stereotyping involved in a copyright dispute over the publication of the so-called Harry Potter Lexicon.Methodologically speaking, I am `on the case'. In being `on the case', politics happen too, which concern the production of knowledge over equality. I situate equality in the context of Jacques Rancière's understanding of it, alongside his understanding of people, politics, and what he refers to as police. In building my research cases, I offer a form of popular knowledge."
etd_40,Polysaccharide-Based Nanocarriers for Improved Drug Delivery,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Drug Delivery, Micelles, Nanoparticles, Polysaccharides, Rheumatoid Arthritis","The field of drug delivery has provided a solution to the limited efficacy and high toxicity of many drugs. Nano-sized drug carriers are popular because their size allows for selective accumulation in the diseased area. Polysaccharides are non-toxic and biodegradable natural polymers that can serve as the basis for these nano-sized carriers. Polysialic acid (PSA) is such a polysaccharide with strong hydrophilicity that may reduce uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and prolong drug circulation. In this study, we developed PSA-based nanocarriers, specifically micelles and nanoparticles, for improved drug delivery with improved efficacy and minimized toxicity. PSA-based micelle systems were developed via conjugation with two hydrophobic groups, decylamine (DA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). Nanoparticles were fabricated via ionic complexation of the negatively charged PSA with positively charged N, N, N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC). All three nanocarriers possessed sizes close to 100 nm with low polydispersity (PDI) and high zeta potential values. Literature suggested that these characteristics would allow the nanocarriers to be physiologically stable and would facilitate passive accumulation within diseased areas. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was selected as the primary disease model for evaluation of our nanocarriers. PSA-PCL micelles and PSA-TMC nanoparticles showed low cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by high IC50 values (PSA-PCL: 10.5 ± 1.7 mg/ml; PSA-TMC: 7.65 ± 0.07 mg/ml) to synovial cells, the so-called conductors of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. The synovial cells were also used to demonstrate effective uptake of fluorescently tagged nanocarriers. Three disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were selected for loading into the nanocarriers. Cyclosporine A (CyA) was encapsulated within the PSA-PCL micelles, while methotrexate (MTX), and dexamethasone (DM) were entrapped within the PSA-TMC nanoparticles. PSA-PCL micelles were loaded with 0.09 ± 0.02 mg CyA per mg of PSA- PCL, while PSA-TMC nanoparticles were loaded with 0.10 ± 0.03 mg MTX and 0.10 ± 0.02 mg DM per mg of PSA-TMC. Controlled release of the DMARDs from the nanocarriers was demonstrated. An in vitro model of rheumatoid arthritis was used to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory nature of the MTX- and DM-loaded PSA-TMC nanoparticles. To the author's knowledge, this is the first time that PSA-based nanocarriers were successfully developed and evaluated for improved drug delivery."
etd_395,Postemancipation Landscapes and Material Culture: The Bethel Community and the Benjamin W. Jackson Plantation,Anthropology,"African American, historical archaeology, jim crow, material culture, tenant farming, Texas archaeology","This dissertation explores the history and archaeology of a postemancipation community that developed around the Benjamin W. Jackson Plantation in Bethel, Texas, particularly concentrating on the transformation of the landscape through the rise of black land ownership and material culture collected at two households occupied by generations of the Davis family. The Davises were tenant farmers whose ancestors were previously enslaved on the plantation and members of the family continued to occupy the lands through the 1950s. In the decades following emancipation the antebellum landscape of the Benjamin Jackson plantation and the Bethel community in East Texas were slowly transformed and developed into an economically diverse community of African American tenants and independent landowners. Over generations, people who were formerly enslaved on the Jackson Plantation as well as people from neighboring plantations and communities built the infrastructure necessary for semi-autonomy, practicing subsistence agriculture and developing formal and informal economies, while in many instances continuing to labor through the production of commercial cotton on white owned land. Drawing upon diverse sources including archaeology, archival research, forms of oral history, art, and landscape, I consider how the material world functioned in the maintenance and reinforcement of unequal social and economic conditions, and also how over generations people engaged with the material world as a mechanism to reformulate and transform these conditions.  The active participation of rural black farmers in consumer markets as a means to subvert and challenge day to day racism is explored, as are shifts in consumption from one generation to another following WWII and the accompanying increase in product diversity and availability during this period."
psy_etd_178,"Power, Likeability, and Perception: Evaluating Men and Women in High and Low Power Positions",Psychology,"Gender Differences, Impression Formation, Leadership, Social Power, Women","When asked, it is relatively easy to come up with an example of a position of high power (e.g., president) or low power (e.g., intern). One can imagine the types of tasks or behaviors each of those positions entails. The theories of social power detail how power is attained, the behaviors of individuals in power, and the consequences of those behaviors (e.g., French & Raven, 1959; Fiske & Depret, 1996; Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003). Most of the studies on behaviors of high power individuals have found that no differences exist between the behaviors of high power men and women. One closely related area of research to social power is leadership, which can be thought of as an example of a position of power. Much of the research has focused on two aspects of leadership: leadership style and evaluation of leaders. Although the research has found negligible style differences between men and women, the largest gender differences are found in how leaders are evaluated. Women tend to be evaluated more negatively in leadership positions, as compared with men (Eagly & Karau, 2002). The goal of the present research was to demonstrate that although high power men and women exhibit similar behaviors, women are evaluated more negatively as compared with men. The first study attempted to replicate research that demonstrates high power individuals' propensity toward self-serving behaviors (Chen, Lee-Chai, & Bargh, 2001). Neither gender nor power significantly predicted self-serving behaviors. The second study asked participants to evaluate an ostensible participant from the first study. Here it was predicted that high power women would be evaluated negatively (compared with men) on a series of evaluation items including liking and hostility. Although no gender effects for targets were found, power condition did significantly predict differences on evaluations of high and low power targets. Possible explanations and future directions are discussed."
etd_388,Power-Aware Planning and Design for Next Generation Wireless Networks,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"approximation algorithm, energy efficiency, polynomial time solutions, resource allocation, wireless network design","Mobile network operators have witnessed a transition from being voice dominated to video/data domination, which leads to a dramatic traffic growth over the past decade. With the 4G wireless communication systems being deployed in the world most recently, the fifth generation (5G) mobile and wireless communica- tion technologies are emerging into research fields. The fast growing data traffic volume and dramatic expansion of network infrastructures will inevitably trigger tremendous escalation of energy consumption in wireless networks, which will re- sult in the increase of greenhouse gas emission and pose ever increasing urgency on the environmental protection and sustainable network development. Thus, energy-efficiency is one of the most important rules that 5G network planning and design should follow.This dissertation presents power-aware planning and design for next generation wireless networks. We study network planning and design problems in both offline planning and online resource allocation. We propose approximation algo- rithms and effective heuristics for various network design scenarios, with different wireless network setups and different power saving optimization objectives. We aim to save power consumption on both base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs) by leveraging wireless relay placement, small cell deployment, device-to- device communications and base station consolidation.We first study a joint signal-aware relay station placement and power alloca- tion problem with consideration for multiple related physical constraints such as channel capacity, signal to noise ratio requirement of subscribers, relay power andnetwork topology in multihop wireless relay networks. We present approximation schemes which first find a minimum number of relay stations, using maximum transmit power, to cover all the subscribers meeting each SNR requirement, and then ensure communications between any subscriber and a base station by ad- justing the transmit power of each relay station. In order to save power on BS, we propose a practical solution and offer a new perspective on implementing green wireless networks by embracing small cell networks. Many existing works have proposed to schedule base station into sleep to save energy. However, in reality, it is very difficult to shut down and reboot BSs frequently due to nu- merous technical issues and performance requirements. Instead of putting BSs into sleep, we tactically reduce the coverage of each base station, and strategi- cally place microcells to offload the traffic transmitted to/from BSs to save total power consumption.In online resource allocation, we aim to save tranmit power of UEs by en- abling device-to-device (D2D) communications in OFDMA-based wireless net- works. Most existing works on D2D communications either targeted CDMA- based single-channel networks or aimed at maximizing network throughput. We formally define an optimization problem based on a practical link data rate model, whose objective is to minimize total power consumption while meeting user data rate requirements. We propose to solve it using a joint optimization approach by presenting two effective and efficient algorithms, which both jointly determine mode selection, channel allocation and power assignment.In the last part of this dissertation, we propose to leverage load migration and base station consolidation for green communications and consider a power- efficient network planning problem in virtualized cognitive radio networks with the objective of minimizing total power consumption while meeting traffic load demand of each Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). First we present aMixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to provide optimal solutions. Then we present a general optimization framework to guide algorithm design, which solves two subproblems, channel assignment and load allocation, in sequence. In addition, we present an effective heuristic algorithm that jointly solves the two subproblems.Numerical results are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis of our schemes, and to show strong performances of our solutions, compared to several baseline methods."
etd_302,Practical Identity and Meaninglessness,Philosophy,"Meaningfulness, Meaning in Life","While research on meaningfulnesss in life is becoming increasingly popular in analytic philosophy, there is still a dearth of literature on the topic of meaninglessness.  This is surprising, given that a better understanding of the nature of meaninglessness may help to illuminate features of meaningfulness previously unobserved or misunderstood.  Additionally, the topic of meaninglessness is interesting in its own right - independent of what it can tell us about meaningfulness.  In my dissertation, I construct and defend my own conception of meaninglessness.I adopt Thaddeus Metz's (2013) analysis of meaninglessness presented in his new book, Meaning in Life: An Analytic Study.  For Metz, meaninglessness is not the absence of meaningfulness but a positively bad state to be in - one that can detract from the overall meaningfulness of a life.  I distinguish between the following: negative meaning (i.e., meaninglessness as a dis-value), positive meaning (i.e., meaningfulness), and lives that lack positive meaning.  I defend a conception of negative meaning.  In contrast, most conceptions of meaninglessness are conceptions of lives where positive meaning is absent.  Philosophers defending these conceptions have yet to acknowledge the existence of negative meaning.  I explain why conceptions of meaninglessness (as the absence of positive meaning) are inadequate and I provide support for the existence of negative meaning."

Childhood cognitive, emotional, and behavioral predictors of young adult social functioning were examined. In addition, the relationship between psychosis and social functioning was explored. Family environment and factors contributing to parental stress in adolescence were investigated as potential mediators of the relationship between significant childhood variables and adult social functioning.Results: Parents rated young adults with 22q11.2DS as having more impaired social functioning than controls. Parent rated childhood internalizing symptoms significantly predicted young adult social functioning in 22q11.2DS, even after controlling for concurrent positive symptoms of psychosis. Problem behaviors contributing to parenting stress in adolescence partially mediated the relationship between child internalizing symptoms and young adult social functioning in 22q11.2DS.Conclusions: These findings highlight child internalizing symptoms and adolescent problem behaviors as potential targets for social functioning interventions designed to prevent / remediate impairments in 22q11.2DS."
etd_241,Predictions and Constraints of Cosmological Correlators,Physics,"CMB Anomalies, Cosmic Microwave Background, Dark Matter, Inflation, Large-Scale Structure, Slavnov Taylor Identities","In this dissertation, we study the role of correlation functions in Cosmology. The study is bidirectional: We explore the constraints that correlation functions gathered from data impose on different theories; we also analyze the constraints that get imposed on correlation functions given symmetries of theories. For the former analysis, we use structure formation data like the CMB and matter power spectrum to set limits on the temperature of cold dark matter particles, basically only assuming that the particles were nonrelativistic when they decoupled and have interacted negligibly since. In another study, we use the same data to constrain how much Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter annihilation could have occurred, with the analysis being insensitive to the details of the annihilation. Finally, we propose a new method to detect the so-called CMB anomalies in a more general manner than is usually considered. For the latter type of analysis, we consider the role of gauge symmetry in constraining relations between $n$- and $(n+1)$-point correlation functions for gravity coupled to a scalar field. Using certain assumptions, we show how novel consistency relations between fields can be derived, that arise only out of the symmetry of the action, and are independent of its particular form."
etd_26,Predictors of Postsecondary Education Attendance for Youth with Learning Disabilities,Psychology,"Postsecondary education, students, learning disabilities","Given the increasing number of students with learning disabilities attending postsecondary educational institutions, it is essential to determine the factors which may play a predictive role in postsecondary education in order to inform educational practices and interventions prior to high school graduation. As such, the primary aim of the current study was to examine which variables may hold predictive value for postsecondary education attendance for students with learning disabilities. This study analyzed the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) in an attempt to identify the variables that predicted the likelihood that youth with disabilities would attend more postsecondary education. A total of 435,437 youth with learning disabilities were included in the present study. The sample of youth with learning disabilities was mostly male (60.9%); family household income was roughly evenly distributed amongst the following three categories: $25,000 or less, $25,001-50,000, and more than $50,000. Youth's education attainment ranged from not finishing high school to completing a four-year college degree. Results indicated that reading achievement, family involvement, and social support played significant roles in predicted graduation from a two-year college or university, such that postsecondary education attendance increased if the youth was had higher reading achievement, had a parent/guardian involved in school activities, and had social support. It was also determined that math achievement, the youth's role in IEP/transition planning, social support, and family involvement all played significant roles in the predicted number of credits earned from a postsecondary institution, such that number of credits increased if the youth had higher math achievement, played more of a leadership role in IEP/transition planning, had social support, and had a parent/guardian involved in school activities. Directions for further research and implications for best transition practices are denoted in light of these results."
etd_431,"PRE-SERVICE ELEMENTARY TEACHERS LEARNING TO FACILITATE STUDENTS’ ENGAGEMENT OF THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS’ MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES: BALANCING ATTENTION TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS, TO ALL LEARNERS, AND TO ONE’S OWN MATHEMATICAL LEARNING",Teaching and Leadership,"Case Study, Common Core, English language learners, Mathematical Practices, Mathematics methods course, Pre-service teachers","Keywords: English language learners; Mathematical Practices; pre-service teachers; mathematics methods course.In this dissertation I examine the experiences of eight pre-service elementary teachers (PSTs) in a mathematics methods course as they learned how to teach Mathematical Practice 1 (make sense of problems and persevere to solve them) and Mathematical Practice 3 (construct viable arguments and critique the arguments of others) from the Common Core State Standards to elementary students in general, and to English language learners in particular. While the principal question that motivated this study concerned PSTs’ preparation to teach mathematical practices to English language learners, it became apparent that that question could not be answered without considering how PSTs prepare to teach the mathematics practices to all learners, and how they learned mathematics themselves.This descriptive case study, which uses qualitative methods, involves collection of the following data: open response surveys (pre-and post); homework reflections; lesson plans; university supervisors’ and host teachers’ reports; and semi-structured interviews of PSTs, university supervisors, and host teachers. I drew initial categories for coding these data from relevant literature, and transcribed, coded, categorized, and generated additional themes from the data (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The study benefited from, and was limited by, the fact that I was both the researcher and the instructor of the course in which the PSTs were enrolled.Applying sociocultural theory, I consider both PSTs’ personal experiences and their interpretation of their students’ personal experiences in their field placements (Forman, 2003). They understood these experiences in terms of six themes: making personal connections with mathematical content, providing access for individual students, holding high expectations for each student, facilitating productive struggle, facilitating social interactions, and developing students’ mathematical language and discourse. All of these themes are important in preparing PSTs to teach mathematics to all elementary students, but each of them has special significance for their preparation to teach English language learners. The PSTs appeared to learn the Mathematical Practices deeply, in part, by reflecting on the significance of these themes for their own mathematical learning.The PSTs had similarities and differences in their beliefs and practices. As other researchers have suggested, it appeared that PSTs needed positive dispositions toward mathematics and the ability to help students make personal connections with mathematics to engage students in Mathematical Practice 1 (Kilpatrick, Swafford, & Findell, 2001), they needed high expectations and strategies for facilitating access in order to engage students in productive struggle (Moschkovich, 2013), and they needed strategies for facilitating social interactions and developing students’ mathematical language and discourse to develop their facility with Mathematical Practice 3.There seemed to be both a general and specific order for learning these themes. In general, PSTs grasped easily and most thoroughly those themes that were similar to ones infused throughout the teacher education program, and they were more likely to struggle with those that were new to them. PSTs who had no direct experience working with ELLs in their field placements had fewer opportunities to develop an understanding of how to engage these students, but some of these PSTs nevertheless developed understandings and skills that would be valuable for teaching ELLs, while one who did work with ELLs still maintained low expectations for their performance. Writing lesson plans helped PSTs think through how to facilitate students’ engagement with mathematical practices; a student whose host teachers insisted they follow scripted lesson plans did not have that opportunity. My summary chapter presents two trajectories for depicting PSTs’ overall learning: one a general trajectory that seems to apply to their learning of any particular theme, and one a trajectory for depicting the order in which different themes are likely to be mastered."
etd_711,Presidential Instability in a Developing Country: Reassessing South Korean Politics from a State-Society Relations Perspective,Political Science,"Korean politics, Korean presidency, Presidentialism, State-society relations","This study attempts to explain why ALL of South Korean presidents, without exception and notwithstanding their individual major contributions to the process of Korea’s development, have fallen victim to disgraceful downfalls.For the analysis, I employ S.N. Sangmpam’s middle-range theory that establishes a causal link between society-rooted politics and political outcomes. Building on his analytical frameworks that non-Western countries are characterized by over-politicization in politics as a function of social context, I argue that patterned downfalls of all Korean presidents are an institutional outcome of over-politicization in Korean politics, which is itself a function of not fully entrenched capitalist society.  In support of my thesis, I test three hypotheses. Hypotheses one and two posit Korea’s tenacious traditional and cultural traits as an internal modifier of capitalism and the nation’s dependent nature of its relationships with the United States and Japan as an external factor that prevented capitalist entrenchment in Korean society.  The combined effect of these two variables is the alteration of capitalism in South Korea that defies the three cardinal rules of democracy, leading to over-politicized behaviors in presidential politics.As for the patterned downfalls of the presidents, I test the hypothesis empirically that as the nation’s most supreme political institution, the Korean presidency displayed the effects of over-politicization most saliently. The evidence reveals that both authoritarian (1948-1987) and democratic (1988-2009) presidents display diverse manifestations of over-politicized behaviors. However, there is also a striking difference between the two eras: Authoritarian presidents seem more influenced by the external causal variable mainly because of Korea’s heavy dependence on the United States and Japan in the formative years of the nation building. Democratic presidents are more challenged by internal causal variable, especially the characteristics of what I call familist collectivism, the dominant operating principle and code of conduct for most Koreans in the period of 1948-2009.  Thus, unless the social causal variable is properly addressed, the problem may remain regardless of regime types."
etd_548,Pressure Reduction on Wide Culverts with EPS Geofoam Backfill,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Arching, Case Study, Culvert, EPS, Finite Element, Geofoam","Buried structures may be subjected to excessive stresses that are detrimental to their expected service life.  A review of previous design methods shows that there are effective methods to reduce loadings on narrow culverts.  The Induced Trench Method introduces compressible fill over a buried structure to mobilize positive arching, and transfer stresses to the side fills.  However, this method has not been studied with Bridge Culverts (large spanning culverts).  This study evaluates the use of EPS (Expanded Polystyrene, Geofoam) as a compressible/lightweight fill material.  The displacements and stresses of the classic narrow trench are examined in detail using the finite difference computer modeling program, FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua).  The narrow trench is then altered to study the overall effect of thickness and width of the compressible zone upon the stresses acting on the buried structure.  To extend the service life of the culvert, recommendations are given on how to design with nearly equivalent horizontal and vertical stresses within an Induced Trench.  In deeply buried structures, great consideration must also be given to the stresses applied on the geofoam.  When geofoam is subjected to large confining axial and confining pressures, it exhibits modulus degradation and can lead to large deformations.  This is observed in detail with the case study of the failure of the geofoam within a Bridge Culvert located in Carrs Creek, NY.  Proper design methods with geofoam on large spanning, deeply buried culverts are evaluated and outlined.  The effects of continuous joints, mixed densities, hydrostatic pressures, overloading, confining stresses, and creep on EPS geofoam are considered.  An exponential model that captures the effect of confinement on modulus degradation has been programmed using FISH (FLAC internal coding) and verified with complimentary laboratory testing.  A properly designed culvert section is shown, in which all the design flaws of the culvert at Carrs Creek have been addressed.  The stresses in the geofoam and underlying culvert are reduced to tolerable stress levels, while deformations have been greatly reduced.  The results of this computer analysis have been presented in such a way that they can be used to aid in proper design of buried structures, using geofoam to reduce stresses and surficial displacements."
fin_etd_10,Price of Islam,Finance,"Social sciences, Islamic companies, Kuwait Stock Exchange, Social norms, Stock returns","We investigate the effect of social norms on the stock returns of firms traded on the Kuwait Stock Exchange by studying Islamic companies (i.e., publicly traded companies that have internal ""Shariah"" boards). The results indicate that during the period 2007-2010, Islamic stocks were traded at a monthly discount of 1.6% in comparison to conventional companies. Two hypotheses provide alternative explanations of this finding. First, there may be a social norm that supports investing in Islamic companies, which increases the demand for these types of stocks, thereby leading to higher prices and lower expected returns. Second, Islamic companies may have reduced profitability due to restrictions on their investment activities, which lowers their expected returns. Consistent with these hypotheses, we find that the demand for Islamic stocks increases conditional on a company being Islamic and big. Second, we find that Islamic companies have lower profitability."
etd_671,"Privacy vs. Security: Fear appeals, terrorism and the willingness to allow increased government surveillance",Mass Communications,"Fear Appeals, Privacy, Security, Terrorism","This study investigates the relationship between fear and privacy by using the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) to examine whether there is an association between fear appeals and the willingness to allow increased governmental surveillance of online and phone communications. Research suggests that, in the United States, privacy is important. Moreover, courts have inferred privacy rights in the U.S. Constitution, including protection from intrusions by the government. However, the threat of terrorism is also very real. There are indications that some people may be willing to allow intrusion by the government if it means keeping them safe. This study uses an experimental method to determine whether the fear of terrorism is stronger than the need to keep private communications secure from the government. EPPM is a predominate theory in the area of fear appeals and persuasion. Scholars indicate that the EPPM can predict whether a persuasive message will be successful based on the levels of threat and efficacy. The underlining assumption of the theory is that if a person feels fear, that person will take some sort of action to alleviate the fear. EPPM research suggests that, in order to persuade, a fear appeal message must contain language that accentuates a high threat and high efficacy to combat the threat. According to the theory, if a person perceives a high threat and high efficacy (i.e., feels he or she has the ability to overcome the threat by taking the action proposed in the message), that person will be persuaded by the message. EPPM is used primarily in the field of health communication; however, this study takes a unique route by using EPPM to study attitudes and behaviors toward terrorism and privacy rights policies. This study used terrorism as the threat and offered two separate efficacy options. The first was allowing increased government surveillance, and the second was individual reporting of suspicious activity to police. The hypotheses based on EPPM were not supported in this study, meaning that there was no indication that the participants who read the fear appeal containing the high threat and high efficacy options were persuaded by the message. However, the results did offer evidence that a high pre-existing perception of the threat could make a fear appeal ineffective. The perceived terrorism threat severity level for all of the experimental groups, including the control group, were high, which left little room for the threat to be increased using a fear appeal. EPPM proposes that, in order to be persuaded, the perceived efficacy felt by the reader of the message must be able to surpass the perceived threat. In this case, it is likely that the perceived threat of terrorism is so high that the efficacy options provided could not overcome the threat. Moreover, the results provided evidence that type of efficacy offered in the fear appeal message is important.This study also extends EPPM research by determining if there is a relationship between cognitive dissonance and rejection of a fear appeal message. Cognitive dissonance refers to inconsistencies between an individual’s beliefs and actions. The theory proposes that if an individual has an inconsistency in her beliefs and behaviors, it can lead to discomfort. The individual will want to alleviate the discomfort by reducing the dissonance, which could mean either changing beliefs or behaviors to make them consistent. This study proposed that the amount of dissonance a person’s feels when reading a fear appeal may affect whether the person accepts or rejects the message. The results showed that cognitive dissonance is a predictor of message rejection. The higher the amount of cognitive dissonance the participant felt when reading the fear appeal message, the more likely that participant was to reject the message. In fact, the results indicated that cognitive dissonance is a better predictor of message rejection than perceived threat and perceived efficacy combined. This finding suggests that cognitive dissonance should be considered when drafting a fear appeal message and that it should be included as a variable in the EPPM theoretical model.Finally, this study investigated the relationship between cognitive dissonance and the privacy paradox theory. The privacy paradox theory refers to an inconsistency between a person’s beliefs and behaviors about privacy. The results indicated that there is a relationship between dissonance and the privacy paradox."
etd_310,"Privileged Resistance: Prisoners of Conscience in the United States, 1980-2013",Social Sciences,"Identity, Nonviolence, Prison, Social Movements, Solidarity, Transnational Feminism","This dissertation tells the story of modern anti-war prisoners of conscience in the United States-people who are incarcerated for six months or more as a result of nonviolent resistance. It explores how they intentionally use and learn about their own privilege in solidarity actions that land them in the belly of the imperial beast; the prison. It traces the lives of forty three such prisoners of conscience, from discernment of action through release, to show how ""who they are"" (in terms of their visible identities and private senses of self) impacts their experiences, the ways they are understood, and their own interpretations of their actions. The story that emerges is about what it feels like to resist the state with your body, how ""whose body"" matters in the shaping, interpretation, and efficacy of resistance, and what white, financially stable, well educated, Christian U.S. citizens learn about their own positionality through living for months and years in America's jails and prisons. What they learn and how they are changed by their experiences is significantly impacted by their racialized gender identities, and the focused story of these individuals works to tell a larger story about patriarchy, neoliberalism, foreign policy, and the contemporary prison industrial complex. The study also provides a model of solidarity activism that takes account of political location, privilege, and ""speaking for."" It challenges nonviolence theory and practice to better understand and articulate its strategy of prison witness, and is also an important intervention into the politics and actual ""doings"" of border crossing solidarity activism that is attentive to personal and global relations of power."
etd_647,Problems in hard and soft matter: From brain folds and Levy localization to active elasticity,Physics,"Active dimers, Anderson localization, Brain folds, Soft Matter","This thesis presents a study of condensed matter systems at different length scales. The first part presents a study of elastic instabilities in biological systems ranging from the cerebral cortex in the brain to the lining of the intestines. Such instabilities lead to a zoo of morphologies ranging from primary folds to villi and crypts to secondary folds and are brought about by growth, mechanical stresses, or a combination of the two. We propose a novel model for the description of primary folds in the cerebral cortex. Motivated by the spatial structure of the cortex, we model its elasticity as a smectic liquid crystal. With this novel description we show that vertical pulling forces via axonal tension from the brain underlying white matter can lead to buckling, which initiates the primary folds.  Moreover, we are able to obtain a reasonable estimate of the critical wavelength and strain for buckling. We also model the formation of secondary folds in the cortex to obtain a more comprehensive theory. We continue this study of elastic instabilities due to growth by studying a more general system comprised of two coupled elastic membranes, one of which undergoes growth and one that does not. We employ an active formulation of growth and compare it to the one due to Rodriguez (Rodriguez). We show that different morphologies corresponding to different systems, such as the cerebral cortex and the lining of the intestines, can be obtained from our model by choosing different active stress functional forms to begin to classify the zoo of morphologies observed in seemingly different biological systems. In the second part of this thesis, to work towards a more microscopic view of biological tissues such as the brain tissue, which is composed of neurons, glial cells, and progenitor cells, we model an experiment (Theveneau) studying the dynamic interaction between neural crest cells and placodal cells in which the placodal cells run away from the neural crest cells following contact between the two.  Our modeling contributes towards generalizing the rules governing the interplay between different cell types, particularly during collective cell migration. In the final part of this thesis, we move to an even smaller length scale. Our main motivations come from a series of experiments on the localization of light and the application of tight-binding models to the electronic transport properties of DNA sequences. To this end, we study the statistical properties of the conductance distribution and Lyapunov exponents in the Anderson tight-binding model with Levy-type disorder."
etd_152,Problems in the Theory of Convergence Spaces,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Convergence Space, Differential Calculus, Discrete Structure, Finite Space, Mereology, Reflexive Digraph","We investigate several problems in the theory of convergence spaces: generalization of Kolmogorov separation from topological spaces to convergence spaces, representation of reflexive digraphs as convergence spaces, construction of differential calculi on convergence spaces, mereology on convergence spaces, and construction of a universal homogeneous pretopological space. First, we generalize Kolmogorov separation from topological spaces to convergence spaces; we then study properties of Kolmogorov spaces. Second, we develop a theory of reflexive digraphs as convergence spaces, which we then specialize to Cayley graphs. Third, we conservatively extend the concept of differential from the spaces of classical analysis to arbitrary convergence spaces; we then use this extension to obtain differential calculi for finite convergence spaces, finite Kolmogorov spaces, finite groups, Boolean hypercubes, labeled graphs, the Cantor tree, and real and binary sequences. Fourth, we show that a standard axiomatization of mereology is equivalent to the condition that a topological space is discrete, and consequently, any model of general extensional mereology is indistinguishable from a model of set theory; we then generalize these results to the cartesian closed category of convergence spaces. Finally, we show that every convergence space can be embedded into a homogeneous convergence space; we then use this result to construct a universal homogeneous pretopological space."
etd_343,Processing and Characterization of Biodegradable Polymer Composites,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"The purpose of this work was to determine processing parameters for the fabrication of biodegradable composites, and then to characterize these composites to determine their feasibility as stent materials.  This was accomplished by using biodegradable polymers. The objective at first was to self-reinforce fibers melt spun using this polymer through hot compaction, which also required additional processing of the melt spun fibers.  However, due to inadequate mechanical properties, improvements in the material were necessary.  The next goal was to test the material with the inclusion of another, highly ductile polymer as a fiber binder.  The results showed that this composite had promising mechanical properties for a coronary stent application.In Chapter 1, motivation as to why a bioabsorbable stent would be beneficial and advantageous over other stent types is given, along with the reasoning behind using poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as the material.  A brief description of the three projects is also provided.  Chapter 2 introduces the issues with as-melt spun PLA fibers, which are amorphous due to the processing method used.  This was solved by applying a strain to the fibers at a temperature above their glass transition temperature, and then annealing them while maintaining strain.  It was observed that a strain was necessary to induce crystalline alignment, but strain beyond 10% had little effect on this alignment. In Chapter 3, compacted blow-spun PLA (Ingeo) fibers and the annealed melt spun fibers were reinforced using the hot compaction method, where heat and pressure are applied to the fibers for a specified amount of time.  The temperature at which these fibers were compacted had a significant effect on the thermal, mechanical, and microstructural properties of the compacted material, and optimal compaction temperatures were found for the Ingeo and melt spun fibers.  However, the strain-to-failure for the compacted material was less than 10% and was deemed inadequate for stent applications.  As a result, in Chapter 4, an additional polymer, poly(xi-caprolactone) (PCL), was added to improve the ductility of the composite, and this incorporation was accomplished through dual electrospinning.  The dual spun composites were then heated to a temperature above the melting point of PCL, but below the melting point of PLA, and characterized and compared to their neat material counterparts.  It was found that increasing PCL content increased the mechanical properties, and made the resulting material more suiTable for a stent application.  Finally, Chapter 5 gives a summary of work accomplished for each project, provides conclusions drawn from the results, and discusses potential future directions."
etd_153,Programming Generality into a Performance Feedback Writing Intervention,Psychology,"academic intervention, generality, generalization, maintenance, performance feedback, writing","Substantial numbers of students in the United States are performing below grade-level expectations in core academic areas, including mathematics, reading, and writing (Aud et al., 2012; National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). National estimates suggest that these deficits are greatest in the area of writing (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012; Persky, Daane, & Jin, 2003), presenting a clear need for research efforts that focus on the development of effective writing interventions. Although performance feedback procedures have been shown to produce promising short-term improvements in elementary-aged students' writing fluency skills (Eckert, Lovett, Rosenthal, Jiao, Ricci, & Truckenmiller, 2006), evidence of maintenance and generalization of these treatment effects is limited (Hier & Eckert, 2014). The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which programming generality into performance feedback procedures enhanced generality of writing fluency gains. A sample of 118 third-grade students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a performance feedback intervention, (b) a performance feedback intervention that incorporated generality programming procedures, or (c) weekly writing practice without performance feedback or generality programming. Intervention effectiveness was assessed in terms of immediate treatment effects, generalization, and maintenance. Results indicated that although the addition of multiple exemplar training to performance feedback procedures did not improve students' writing fluency on measures of stimulus and response generalization, it did result in greater maintenance of intervention effects in comparison to students who received performance feedback without generality programming and students who engaged in weekly writing practice alone."
etd_574,PROTEIN PRENYLATION BY GERANYLGERANYLTRANSFERASE TYPE I (GGTASE-I): UNDERSTANDING THE SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION AND ACTIVITY REGULATION OF A MULTISPECIFIC ENZYME,Chemistry,"cellular geranylgeranylation, enzyme reengineering, fluorescence microscopy, GGTase-I, Prenylation, substrate selectivity","Protein prenylation is a post-translational modification wherein a substrate protein is modified by the attachment of a 20- or 15- carbon isoprenoid group to a cysteine residue near its C-terminus, by protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I) or protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) respectively. This modification provides a hydrophobic group that can aid protein association with cellular membranes and enable protein-protein interactions. These enzymes recognize their substrates using a C-terminal Ca1a2X sequence where C denotes the cysteine residue being modified and the a1, a2 and X residues dictate substrate specificity for GGTase-I or FTase. Crystallographic studies have provided a structural model of the a2 residue binding pocket within GGTase-I, but the functional roles of many of the proposed enzyme-substrate interactions in the active site remain to be defined. We have characterized amino acid residues in the active site of GGTase-I that engender substrate specificity at the a2 position using techniques such as site-directed  and saturation mutagenesis, GGTase-I mutant library screening, and peptide substrate structure-activity studies. GGTase-I substrate specificity can be reengineered by mutating a small number of amino acids in the active site, similar to the malleable substrate selectivity observed with FTase. Our work supports the idea that tunable substrate specificity may be a general property of multispecific enzymes involved in post-translational modification. The mutant GGTase-I enzymes described in this work can be used as unique tools, to potentially probe the effects of prenylation pathway modifications on target protein localization and function without altering the larger prenylated proteome.To assess geranylgeranylation in a biologically relevant context, we have developed tools for determining GGTase-I prenylation activity inside a cell. Based on predictive algorithms and in vitro peptide reactivities, many Ca1a2X sequences have been identified as potential substrates for GGTase-I although, the ability of these sequences to be geranylgeranylated within the cell is still unknown. To address this question, we have developed a fluorescence reporter protein series that spans several orders in reactivity with GGTase-I and determined the minimum reactivity required for this reporter protein to be geranylgeranylated inside an intact mammalian cell. Further, we have demonstrated application of this calibrated GGTase-I sensor to monitor changes in GGTase-I activity in response to inhibitors or genetic mutations. Determination of the GGTase-I activity within the cell will help in defining the prenylated proteome and identifying GGTase-I dependent pathways for therapeutic targeting."
etd_82,Public Policy and Postsecondary Education,Economics,"Federal Financial Aid, Financial Education, Financial Literacy, Higher Education Act of 1965, Individual Development Accounts, Postsecondary Educatioin","Chapter 1This paper presents estimates of the impact of educational saving incentives on college saving decisions from the Michigan SEED Program, a field experiment that targeted low-income families with young children.  The treatment group was offered initial deposits of as much as $1,000 in the child's name into the state-sponsored 529 college savings plan when the child was 4 years old.  Additional deposits by the treatment group were matched dollar for dollar.  After four years, or when the children were 8 years old, 529 plan ownership was 59 percentage points higher for treatment- relative to control-group families.  In addition, 22% of treatment-group families contributed their own funds, and, among these, the average family contribution was $440 during that period.  For every dollar saved in a 529 plan, total college saving increased 25-45 cents, indicating 55-75% crowd-out.Chapter 2This paper presents estimates of the impact of student eligibility for federal financial aid on total student debt.  I exploit a natural experiment created by the 1992 Amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965, which removed assets from the calculation of federal aid eligibility for families with earned income of less than $50,000.  Overall, my estimates suggest that expansions in federal student aid eligibility have large, significant effects on total undergraduate debt accumulation.  Each dollar of federal aid eligibility increases student debt by about 40 cents.  This relationship is due to new, rather than existing, borrowers.  A $1,000 increase in eligibility is predicted to increase the ratio of debt to total price of attendance by 4 percentage points.  I find that the effect of federal aid eligibility on debt is significantly higher for those with more exposure to higher education.  Based on my central estimates, the expansion in aid eligibility caused by the 1992 Amendment is responsible for about one-third of the growth in total student debt from 1989-90 to 1993-94.Chapter 3The experimental and quasi-experimental literature finds few positive effects of financial education on financial behavior and wealth.  I posit that the lack of measurable effects may be a result of the underlying relationship between financial literacy and asset accumulation.  Theoretical literature suggests that financial education and traditional education are complements in the wealth production function, so the effect of financial education is conditional on years of schooling.  To empirically test this theoretical hypothesis, I provide the first experimental evidence on the elasticity of substitution between traditional schooling and financial education in terms of wealth production in this paper.  I am able to credibly identify this elasticity with data from the Learn$ave IDA program, a randomized control trial that exogenously shifted the costs of these inputs to wealth production.  Using a dual translog cost function specification, I estimate an iterated 3SLS strategy to measure individual elasticities of substitution between wealth production inputs.  The mean value of all of the individual estimated elasticities of substitution is greater than zero, indicating that, on average, the inputs are substitutes."
etd_25,Putting the Ghost Back in the Machine: A Defense of Common Sense Dualism,Philosophy,"Common Sense, Dualism, Free Will, Naturalism, Philosophical Method, Physicalism","Gilbert Ryle once ridiculed substance dualism, describing it as the view that we are a ""ghost in the machine."" Since that time, substance dualism has found few defenders, and a presumption toward naturalism has dominated philosophical inquiry. Here, I offer an unapologetic defense this unfashionable view of the self. To do so, I first explain why philosophy should endorse a shift in method away from naturalism and toward common sense philosophy. I then show how, from within that approach, substance dualism is far better supported than its competitors. My defense of the common sense method rests heavily on an account of justification and of evidence defended by Michael Huemer, and results in the view that we should give strong presumptive weight to common sense. I proceed to argue that a commitment to active, immaterial minds is built into the conception of human nature used in everyday life, and therefore qualifies as a tenet of common sense. This fact gives a strong presumption to dualism. I finish by considering objections to dualism, and showing that they not only fail to overcome this strong presumption, but would fail to overcome even a moderate conservatism with regard to beliefs about the nature of the mind."
etd_617,Quantification of factors influencing the sporulation phenotype in Myxococcus xanthus,Biology,,"When starved, Myxococcus xanthus initiates a multifaceted developmental program that culminates in the formation of spore-filled structures called fruiting bodies. When characterizing a strain, a threshold sporulation efficiency frequently serves as the defining metric for developmental competence. While the sporulation assay does provide a quantitative measure of an important phenotypic trait, it displays a high degree of variability even between experimental replicates. This variability means that, while mutant strains displaying strong sporulation defect are easy to detect, ones with more subtle defects are impossible to differentiate from wild-type.The first aim of this work was to optimize the M. xanthus sporulation assay by determining the source of error associated with each variable, thereby establishing a more comprehensive understanding of how each variable influences spore recovery. These variables, such as incubation temperature, sonication time and intensity, plating dilutions, and germination time, were all tested individually. After maximizing spore recovery and minimizing the variability between independent replicates of wild-type, we characterized a small subset of mutant strains with known sporulation phenotypes to demonstrate that these optimized conditions improve the reproducibility of the spore assay for both mutant and wild-type strains.The first aim examined the influence of known variables on the sporulation assay; the second aim examined an unknown variable that may also have influence on sporulation. Specifically, we tested how the distribution of cells affected sporulation by altering the surface-to-volume ratio of a starving population. We were able to show a significant change in the spore recovery of wild-type, indicating that the cell population size is an important new variable. We also demonstrated that spore recovery was influenced by the spacing and arrangement of separate populations too far apart to physically interact. This new variable, which we have deemed the “1-3-5 effect”, can be altered through mutation, and requires populations to be placed on the same agar surface. Our current hypothesis is that the 1-3-5 effect is caused by overlapping gradients of a diffusible signal within the agar substrate."
etd_38,Quantifying groundwater-surface water interactions to improve the outcomes of human activities,Earth Sciences,"alpine meadows, groundwater, heat tracing, stream restoration, surface water, tropical glaciers","Interactions between surface water and groundwater impact both the quality and quantity of water resources. This dissertation is focused on the interactions between surface water in streams and groundwater in hyporheic zones and shallow fluvial aquifers, and how human beings influence these interactions and are influenced by them. The three chapters of this dissertation span scales from cm to km and locations from Upstate New York to the Peruvian Andes, but are united by the goal to improve the scientific understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions (GWSWI) using novel techniques, in order to improve the outcomes of human activities for people and ecosystems.Heat is a useful tracer for quantifying GWSWI, but analyzing large amounts of raw thermal data has many challenges. Chapter 1 presents a computer program named VFLUX for processing raw temperature time series and calculating vertical water flux in shallow sub-surface-water systems. The workflow synthesizes several recent advancements in signal processing, and adds new techniques for calculating flux rates with large numbers of temperature records from high-resolution sensor profiles. The program includes functions for quantitatively evaluating the ideal spacing between sensor pairs, and for performing error and sensitivity analyses for the heat transport model due to thermal parameter uncertainty. The new method is demonstrated by processing two field temperature time series datasets collected using discrete temperature sensors and a high-resolution DTS profile. The analyses of field data show vertical flux rates significantly decreasing with depth at high-spatial resolution as the sensor profiles penetrate shallow, curved hyporheic flow paths, patterns which may have been obscured without the unique analytical abilities of VFLUX.Natural channel design restoration projects in streams often include the construction of cross-vanes, which are stone, dam-like structures that span the active channel, and are often thought to increase local hyporheic exchange. In Chapter 2, vertical hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) and redox-sensitive solutes were measured in the streambed around 4 cross-vanes with different morphologies. Observed patterns of HEF and redox conditions are not dominated by a single, downstream-directed hyporheic flow cell beneath cross-vanes. Instead, spatial patterns of moderate (Melting tropical glaciers supply approximately half of dry season stream discharge in glacierized valleys of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru. The remainder of streamflow originates as groundwater stored in alpine meadows, moraines and talus slopes. A better understanding of the dynamics of alpine groundwater, including sources and contributions to streamflow and GWSWI, is important for making accurate estimates of glacial inputs to the hydrologic budget, and for our ability to make predictions about future water resources as glaciers retreat. The field study described in Chapter 3 focused on two high-elevation meadows in valleys of the Blanca. Tracer measurements of stream and spring discharge and groundwater-surface water exchange were combined with synoptic sampling of water isotopic and geochemical composition, in order to characterize and quantify contributions to streamflow from different geomorphic features. In a valley headwaters study site, groundwater supplied approximately half of stream discharge from the meadow, with most originating in a debris fan adjacent to the meadow and little from the meadow itself (6%); however, in at a mid-valley study site, where meadows are extensive, local groundwater has a large impact on stream flow and chemistry through large net discharge and fractional hydrologic turnover."
etd_326,Quantitative Investigation of Factors Impacting Protein Farnesylation Within the Cell,Chemistry,,"Prenylation is a lipidation post-translational modification wherein a hydrophobic isoprenoid group is attached to a protein at the cysteine of a C-terminal ""Ca1a2X"" target sequence by protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) or protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I).  This modification and subsequent processing steps aid in protein localization to cellular membranes.  While many peptide sequences have been shown to be substrates for the protein prenyltransferases in in vitro assays, it is unclear how many of these sequences can successfully compete for prenylation by FTase or GGTase-I within the pool of potential substrate proteins within the cell. To address this uncertainty, we aim to determine the minimal substrate reactivity required for a target protein to be recognized and prenylated in the presence of endogenous levels of FTase, FPP lipid donor cosubstrate, and competing protein substrates within a living mammalian cell.  By modifying the hypervariable region and the C -terminal sequence of a fluorescent fusion protein, we have developed a series of reporter proteins whose reactivity with FTase is systematically varied over several orders of magnitude. In combination, these reporter proteins provide a calibrated sensor for probing endogenous FTase activity. Our methodology also provides a novel approach to detect changes in FTase activity within an intact cell in response to genomic mutations or environmental stimuli.  Quantitative determination of the ""threshold"" for prenylation within the cell will help define the extent of the prenylated proteome and aid in studying the prenylation-dependent pathways and the mechanism of therapeutics targeting the prenylation pathway."
etd_518,"Que Salgamos más Adelante: Identity, Community, and the Desire for Development in Oaxaca, Mexico",Anthropology,"Community Development, Ecotourism, Identity, Oaxaca, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Zapotec","This dissertation examines how the desire to salir adelante, to improve oneself and one’s community, motivates townspeople to participate in development projects that promise to support and strengthen their pueblo.  More specifically, I examine the material, social, and moral dimensions of progress and development, and the various ways indigenous people claim their place in the modern world.  I am interested in the ways Zapotec people in Oaxaca, Mexico engage with development strategies and make them amenable to their own cultural practices and values.  I am likewise interested in the extent to which the skills, habits, orientations and identities generated through development initiatives may contribute to the production of politicized forms of ethnic attachment in the struggle for indigenous rights.I explore two very distinct arenas through which residents have pursued a better life.  The first – community-based ecotourism – is a conventional, state-sponsored initiative that exemplifies current trends in participatory development.  The second arena – the Seventh-day Adventist Church – is a more unexpected example of an organized effort to intervene in the lives of poor and marginalized people.  It is an effort that seeks to advance a notion of progress and change, albeit in much smaller, less hegemonic, and profoundly spiritually ways.Rather than rely on conventional economic or instrumentalist measures in my analysis of these two distinct but complementary groups, I elaborate on an alternative set of criteria for evaluating efforts to pursue a better life.  These criteria speak to the broader social, cultural, moral and emotional fields within which these interventions take place, and include: the valorization of indigenous identity; support for the practices and values of reciprocity and service that make community; fulfillment of spiritual duties in the quest for salvation; and attention to personal achievement, such as the cultivation of habits and dispositions that strengthen community participation.My research builds on current discussions about the moral dimensions of development, the link between development and the production of local identity, and the value of the community-studies approach in an era of hyper mobility and globalization.  By re-enmeshing community in place, I provide an analysis of how, why, and where people form meaningful, intimate, and actionable bonds, as well as the limits to identity-based solidarity and action.  I find that residents’ engagements with community-based ecotourism and the Seventh-day Adventist Church both complement and strengthen local, pueblo-oriented identities.  At the same time, they also exacerbate already-existing structural factors that challenge the rise of region-wide ethnic solidarities."

Questioning is critical to design synthesis, supporting learning, problem identification and solving, creativity, evaluation, decision making, and identification and reduction of uncertainty. Jon Kolko refers to design synthesis the magic of design, an abductive, creative sensemaking process generally invisible to observers and often to designers, making it difficult to formalize design and discounting the value of design research and synthesis. Extensive research exists on what designers do, substantially less on how designers think, and very little on cognitive questioning behavior during design from user-based perspectives.The general goal of this study is to help illuminate information gaps that exist for faculty early in the instructional design process. The overarching goal of this study is to provide a starting point for future research on interventions to aid designers from all disciplines with question-asking during design, based on techniques used in commercial nuclear power. The general research objective is to empirically describe faculty's cognitive question-asking behavior during conceptual instructional design. Specific research objectives include exploring questions faculty ask, identifying uses faculty associate with the questions they ask, identifying patterns of behavior in the descriptions faculty provide, and exploring what faculty feel is important about question-asking during instructional design.This qualitative, descriptive study applied Brenda Dervin's user-based sense-making methodology to explore actual questions asked by faculty using timeline interviews. Data was analyzed using deductive and semi-inductive content analysis, descriptive statistics, and design mapping of faculty's questions to other design domains.Results include a variety of faculty questions, concerns, and behaviors including information seeking, concern for students and self, uncertainty about the current design situation, concerns about cross-disciplinary instructional design and complexity, expert/novice issues, and motivational techniques. Participants see value in asking questions during instructional design, but several communicated that they're not trained enough in instructional design. Multiple opportunities were identified for provision of design support and faculty development.As a whole, this study offers two contributions to the fields of instructional design, information science, and design research. First, it provides in-depth exploration of questions asked by faculty designers-by-assignment and expert faculty instructional designers during early conceptual instructional design involving something that is new to them, highlighting problems experienced by faculty. It reaffirms some of the earlier conceptual work about the role of question-asking during design and the needs of instructional designers, and suggests means to aid faculty with instructional design and information seeking. Second, it provides a detailed example of application of design mapping to identify commonalities in question-asking behavior across multiple design domains, a partial proof of concept for design as a discipline. This study provides a basis for future research on interventions to aid designers with question-asking."

It seeks to determine the assessment of New Orleans residents of the various possible sources of risk information that are available to them, and how race and socioeconomic class affect their level of trust in those sources. A 37-question telephone survey was conducted in Orleans Parish by the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University in June and July of 2012. There were 414 completed surveys, with 278 landline telephone and 136 cell phone respondents. The overall margin of error was +/- 4.8% at a 95% confidence interval. SPSS software was used to analyze data testing four hypotheses for each of two research questions on risk assessment: the first on race, the second on class (socioeconomic status, or ""SES""). An ANCOVA was used to test the hypotheses of the first research question, while Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient Test was used to test the second. A trust index was constructed by aggregating Likert-scales responses to questions on the elements of trust in sources, and an SES index was constructed by aggregating education and income responses. After controlling for SES, Whites were shown to have significantly more trust in mass media, local community leaders and spokespersons, and interpersonal communication than Blacks did. After controlling for race, SES was found to be negatively correlated with trust in local TV news, non-news websites, and social media sites.

It is based on eight interviews with Ethiopian immigrants, a historical analysis, as well as my involvement with the widerDisapora community through my internship with the Government of the District of Columbia Mayor’s Office on African Affairs (MOAA) during summer 2015. This allowed me to interact with local community groups and leaders, as well as observe public events held by members of the Ethiopian Disapora. The findings indicate that racial and ethnic identity can influence upward mobility as well as political engagement. It argues a sense of Ethiopian nationalism or ethnic affiliation is expressed in part through affiliation with, and display of, particular versions of their home country's flag, providing a public yet low-key way of political engagement. World Systems and Marxist theories are used to show that ‘race’ is one of the major markers of identities in the United States, where the mode of production is capitalism. Ethiopians’ self-identification in terms of race and ethnicity does not matter necessarily because the state and the system of production in the United States locate them along a racialized spectrum of belonging. Since class is mediated by race, racial identity is not something they want to take on but it is forced up on them. As part of the larger population of Black immigrants, Ethiopians find themselves lumped into a certain category by the dominant society and thus bond along racial, regional or ethnic lines. As I observed during my internship at the MOAA, although Ethiopians tend to associate more amongst themselves socially, they appreciate their collective identity in the work place and other public spaces. The study also attempts to explore the connection between racial and ethnic identity and political engagement, particularly the politics of nationalism. Lastly, it draws on the broader implication of Ethiopia’s Pan-African consciousness claiming that the country’s development is closely connected to its ability to make a common cause – not just at political level – with African nations regionally, continentally and globally."
etd_625,Racial Incidents in the Classroom: A Qualitative Study on Preschool Teachers’ Perceptions,Child and Family Studies,,"This dissertation examines the extent to which 35 early childhood educators’ training and experiences influence their perception of and subsequent teaching strategies racial incidents that occur in a preschool classroom. The study used focus groups to explore the implications of a teacher’s ability to a) perceive the racial situation; and b) act or intervene through curriculum or other choices to turn the situation into a “teachable moment”. Using the theories of social learning, intergroup contact, perspectives on ethnic/race identity formation and foundations of multicultural education, the study addresses what role early educators and their strategies could play in reducing the formation of prejudices and negative stereotypes in preschool-aged children. The findings suggest early educators are not only reluctant to “label” children as being racist or discriminatory, but also largely believe children are incapable of these types of thoughts; young children are blameless in their actions. Furthermore, participants routinely asserted that external influences, namely parents, are to blame for children’s thoughts and actions around race and gender. Participants also felt their teacher training around multicultural education was inadequate, making it difficult to know how to intervene in racial incidents in their classroom. Following teaching strategies were limited to books and songs or parent focused conversations. Implications for future study include assessing teacher perceptions of racial events when children are of the same race or gender and using videos of real-life examples or using ethnographic methods. Limitations are discussed including small sample size, and subject selection."

The study utilizes multiple qualitative methods such as participant observation, unstructured interviews and focus groups. Rather than race identity or racism, the discourses of race and how they are produced or adopted by students on a university campus are central to this work. Drawing from Critical Race Theory, Critical Whiteness Studies, and other race theories, I present qualitative analyses about race, which demonstrate how racism is cloaked and persists in colorblind discourse and the race talk of educated young people. This work illuminates how colorblind discourses function for different racial groups of people, exposes the mechanics of race talk, and challenges the stasis of current racial/multicultural education. I conclude with implications for further research and recommendations for educators to be more vigilant and productive in anti-racist and justice education for all students."

Several algorithms have been formulated for such problems, usually based on formulating a problem-dependent heuristic or distance metric. This dissertation proposes anomaly detection algorithms that exploit the notion of ``rank,"" expressing relative outlierness of different points in the relevant space, and exploiting asymmetry in nearest neighbor relations between points: a data point is ``more anomalous"" if it is not the nearest neighbor of its nearest neighbors. Although rank is computed using distance, it is a more robust and higher level abstraction that is particularly helpful in problems characterized by significant variations of data point density, when distance alone is inadequate.We begin by proposing a rank-based outlier detection algorithm, and then discuss how this may be extended by also considering clustering-based approaches. We show that the use of rank significantly improves anomaly detection performance in a broad range of problems.We then consider the problem of identifying the most anomalous among a set of time series, e.g., the stock price of a company that exhibits significantly different behavior than its peer group of other companies. In such problems, different characteristics of time series are captured by different metrics, and we show that the best performance is obtained by combining several such metrics, along with the use of rank-based algorithms for anomaly detection.In practical scenarios, it is of interest to identify when a time series begins to diverge from the behavior of its peer group. We address this problem as well, using an online version of the anomaly detection algorithm developed earlier.Finally, we address the task of detecting the occurrence of anomalous sub-sequences within a single time series. This is accomplished by refining the multiple-distance combination approach, which succeeds when other algorithms (based on a single distance measure) fail.The algorithms developed in this dissertation can be applied in a large variety of application areas, and can assist in solving many practical problems."

In these experiments, characteristics of contexts including audience’s status, audience’s standard, audience’s performance and publicness of the situation were manipulated to examine participants’ reactions to feedback pertaining to an ostensibly important ability. These experiments revealed that compared to the interdependent self-construal, the independent self-construal was associated with higher levels of self-serving responses. These self-serving responses include attributing failure to external factors and attributing success to internal ones, derogating a failed test, and expressing less interest in taking a failed rather than a succeeded test again. These self-serving responses would be helpful for the independent self-construal individuals to maintain a positive self-view. Inhibited self-serving behaviors, on the other hand, were observed in the interdependent self-construal participants in some conditions such as when the audience held a high standard and when the audience failed a test the participants succeeded in. I argue that these inhibited self-serving responses were effective for the interdependent self-construal individuals to restore social harmony and repair the face of the affected others. Divergent routes individuals with different self-construals take to achieve social well-being, self-esteem versus face, were discussed."

ESL students may be considered an at-risk group for performance on reading comprehension portions of classroom and high stakes tests (HST) like the SAT. However, little research has examined the test taking behaviors and skills of ESL college students on timed tests of reading comprehension. The present study assessed 84 ESL and 84 native English speaking (L1) college students on a variety of measures commonly associated with HST. Results revealed that ESL students performed poorer on tests of reading speed, reading comprehension, vocabulary, and word recognition. Despite their lower reading comprehension performance, ESL students did not engage in different testing behaviors or test taking strategies compared to the L1 students. ESL students reported lower confidence in their abilities to perform on reading tests than the L1 students but did not report higher test anxiety. Vocabulary was the strongest predictor of reading comprehension performance for the ESL students. Implications of these findings as well as limitations and directions for future research are discussed"
etd_303,"READING BODIES: ASSOCIATIONISM, EMPATHY,  AND THE ETHICS OF SENSATION IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION",English,"Affect, History of the Book, Sensation, Victorian","This dissertation explores the intersection between scientific knowledge about the body and literature's capacity to cultivate empathy. To construct this history, I bring together selections from nineteenth-century fiction-particularly those texts written to inspire strong feelings in their readers-and the dominant nineteenth-century scientific theory of cognition and feeling, Associationism. These fictional texts use key concepts from Associationism to construct an ethics of reading, which they then attempt to teach their readers. Through attention to form and publication history, I investigate the ways in which Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, and Walter Besant use Associationism to understand the physiological effects their texts have on readers, and how those effects might make readers more ethical people. The connection between science, ethics, and reading in the nineteenth-century required assumptions about gender and the capacity to read bodies: that women are more emotional, more ethical, and should more readily give up their agency to stabilize society. I conclude with a cautionary reading that locates these nineteenth-century discourses of science, ethics, and social improvement in twenty-first century articles on cognitive science and affect theory."
etd_32,"Recombinant Expression, Purification, and Characterization of an HIV-1 Tat-Human Cyclin T1 Chimera",Chemistry,"HIV-1, Tat, Tat Protein Characterization, Tat Protein Expression","Efficient transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the interaction of the viral protein Tat with the trans-activation response (TAR) stem-loop of the long-terminal repeat (LTR) portion of nascent viral RNA. The production of viable transcripts is enhanced dramatically by the interaction of HIV-1 Tat with the host protein human Cyclin T1. Interaction with hCycT1 remodels Tat protein contributing a single cysteine residue that is critical to the formation of the second of two zinc fingers (Zn2). Here we suggest that it is the presence of this critical cysteine residue and not the presence of arginine residues from human Cyclin T1 that imparts high affinity and specificity to the interaction with HIV-1 TAR RNA. Crucial structural features of this interaction remain unresolved by NMR or existing crystal structures. Specifically, the structure of the Tat activation domain (AD), and Tat interaction with hCycT1 while bound to HIV-1 TAR RNA remain elusive. Much of the difficulty in obtaining structural data is a result of the notoriously difficult expression of native HIV-1 Tat caused in large part by the high cysteine count, and poor solubility of the Tat protein. This work presents a protocol for the expression and purification of a high affinity recombinant chimeric protein which includes the full 101 amino acid Tat protein fused to an essential minimal portion of CycT1m) necessary for TAR binding in sufficient purity and concentration for structural study by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).The elucidation of this critical region has the potential for profound impact in the structural based drug design of HIV-1 therapeutics."

Utilizing a mixed-method, text-heavy approach, I conduct analyses of both state behavior and NGO activity within the first cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of Human Rights and examine the monitoring and follow-up practices between review rounds through paired cases in the second round of reviews. In these analyses, first I show that NGO activity, after controlling for the amount of state activity, human rights record, region, and issue area, is related to higher rates of states rejecting recommended changes and thus the exhibition of resistance to international pressure. Second, state rejection of recommendations increases with the level of demands in the recommendation, worsening human rights records, and when the recommendation covers specific international obligations or political rights such as basic freedoms and the rule of law. Moreover, recommendations covering women's rights or the rights of the child are more likely to be accepted. Third, I establish that states express their resistance to international human rights norms in one of two fashions: with culturally-, religiously-, or nationally-particularistic claims or with appeals to state sovereignty. Finally, I highlight the centrality of NGOs in the monitoring process between cycles of the UPR process, tying NGO engagement and participation over the duration to reporting on compliance with recommended changes from the preceding cycle of review."
etd_400,Reconfiguring French Secularism: The Mosque as the New Multicultural Space of Young Muslims,Anthropology,"France, Mosque, Multiculturalism, Muslim youth, Place-making, Secularism","This dissertation explores the ways in which secularism communicates with Islam both as a socio-political concept and as daily practice in the context of France. Most studies examine this process through the uses of the headscarf or within the framework of terrorism. This study suggests a fresh perspective by using an experimental spatial analysis with a focus on the major mosques and the practices of mosque congregants. It poses the question how French Muslims reconcile French secularism (laïcité) with Islam through the use of the mosque space. In this respect, mosques are transformed into alternative multicultural spaces where the secular and Islamic are given new meanings and negotiated by Muslims. I argue that the primary actors of this transformation are young Muslims with a dynamic and innovative approach to contextual interpretations of secular and Islamic practices. In this respect, they differ from their conservative counterparts who are bound to the Islamic teachings in Muslim countries regardlessof their relevancy. This study concludes that young French Muslims have been undergoing a change from within, and its effects in the wider society are yet to be observed amidst the escalating negative views against Muslims in the West."
geo_etd_71,"Recreation Capital: Natural Resources, Amenity Development, and Outdoor Recreation in Bend, Oregon",Geography,"Amenity Development, Environmental History, Natural Resources, Oregon, Outdoor Recreation","This dissertation examines the production of recreational resources associated with amenity development. I argue that recreational resources are produced along lines similar to the production of timber, water, or mineral resources. Their production depends on the material characteristics of the resource, infrastructures of development, institutional arrangements, and the cultural symbolic value of rural and natural spaces. Scholars of amenity development have glossed over both the material elements of recreational resources and the history of resource development related to amenity landscapes. As a result, these scholars have overlooked insights concerning the production of resource spaces and evolving relationships between the city and the countryside. The dissertation utilizes insights from critical resource geography, the environmental history of resource development, cultural landscape studies, and histories of the American West. Drawing from sources such as government reports, business records, archival records, personal interviews, and newspaper research I construct a narrative of recreational development in Bend, Oregon since 1950. Before Bend became emblematic of the recreational development of the New West it functioned largely as a single industry company town, making it an ideal place to consider the production of recreational resources at the end of the 20th century.After introducing the dissertation's goals and exploring the theoretical interventions it makes in chapter one, I examine, in chapter two, the resource relationships between Bend and its hinterland leading up to World War II, with particular attention to how the region's recreational opportunities were used alongside its timber and ranching resources. Chapter three addresses national concerns about recreational resource supply and demand by considering the work of the Outdoor Recreational Resource Review Commission and their effort to rationalize recreational resources and make them legible for conservation and development. Chapter four examines how one firm, Brooks Scanlon, converted some of its timberlands to a golf resort, capitalizing on the recreational amenities offered by its former timberland and setting the standard for further amenity development in Central Oregon. Chapter five examines the political debate about how to manage land on the urban fringe-land valuable for real estate development--in light of conflicts between the right to develop private property and the common good associated with symbolic and material characteristics of the countryside, in this case, migratory deer. Chapter six considers the infrastructure of the countryside and the city in the production of recreational resources through an examination of historical development and commercialization of the Century Drive Scenic Byway, Black Butte Ranch, and the Old Mill District. In Chapter seven, I return again to real estate development on the urban fringe to consider the impact of fire on exurban development and the institutional arrangements associated with reducing the risk and damage to recreational resources. Finally, I offer a conclusion that considers the production of recreational resources and its relationship to the production of space and the cultural landscape."
etd_104,Reform-Based Science Teaching: A Mixed-Methods Approach to Explaining Variation in Secondary Science Teacher Practice,Science Teaching,"professional development, reform-based science teaching, secondary science, teacher preparation, teacher socialization","The purpose of this two-phase, sequential explanatory mixed-methods study was to understand and explain the variation seen in secondary science teachers' enactment of reform-based instructional practices.   Utilizing teacher socialization theory, this mixed-methods analysis was conducted to determine the relative influence of secondary science teachers' characteristics, backgrounds and experiences across their teacher development to explain the range of teaching practices exhibited by graduates from three reform-oriented teacher preparation programs.  Data for this study were obtained from the Investigating the Meaningfulness of Preservice Programs Across the Continuum of Teaching (IMPPACT) Project, a multi-university, longitudinal study funded by NSF.In the first quantitative phase of the study, data for the sample (N=120) were collected from three surveys from the IMPPACT Project database.  Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to examine the separate as well as the combined influence of factors such as teachers' personal and professional background characteristics, beliefs about reform-based science teaching, feelings of preparedness to teach science, school context, school culture and climate of professional learning, and influences of the policy environment on the teachers' use of reform-based instructional practices. Findings indicate three blocks of variables, professional background, beliefs/efficacy, and local school context added significant contribution to explaining nearly 38% of the variation in secondary science teachers' use of reform-based instructional practices. The five variables that significantly contributed to explaining variation in teachers' use of reform-based instructional practices in the full model were, university of teacher preparation, sense of preparation for teaching science, the quality of professional development, science content focused professional, and the perceived level of professional autonomy.Using the results from phase one, the second qualitative phase selected six case study teachers based on their levels of reform-based teaching practices to highlight teachers across the range of practices from low, average, to high levels of implementation.  Using multiple interview sources, phase two helped to further explain the variation in levels of reform-based practices.  Themes related to teachers' backgrounds, local contexts, and state policy environments were developed as they related to teachers' socialization experiences across these contexts.  The results of the qualitative analysis identified the following factors differentiating teachers who enacted reform-based instructional practices from those who did not: 1) extensive science research experiences prior to their preservice teacher preparation; 2) the structure and quality of their field placements; 3) developing and valuing a research-based understanding of teaching and learning as a result of their preservice teacher preparation experiences; 4)  the professional culture of their school context where there was support for a high degree of professional autonomy and receiving support from ""educational companions"" with a specific focus on teacher pedagogy to support student learning; and 5) a greater sense of agency to navigate their districts' interpretation and implementation of state polices. Implications for key stakeholders as well as directions for future research are discussed."

Researchers have focused on the relationship between individuals' personalities and social media use. However, they have not taken into account individuals' cultural backgrounds regarding social media use. Although there are different aspects of behaviors regarding selfies among different individuals, little is known about the relationship between individuals' cultural backgrounds and their selfie practice.This thesis aims to explore the relationship between individuals' cultural characteristics and selfie practices, including posting and interacting with others on Instagram. This study investigated selfie users on Instagram using an online survey via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Selfie users in the U.S (N=354) and India (N=396) were examined to explore cultural difference in selfie usages.Most previous cross-cultural studies assumed that nationality defines one's cultural characteristics. However, researchers have pointed out that the classification may be overgeneralized and that there is a need to explore different cultures at the level of an individual. Through measuring personal traits of independent and interdependent self-construal, this thesis explored the relationship between cultural characteristics and selfie practice at both individual and country level. Implications for the relationship are discussed."
etd_332,Reliable Inference from Unreliable Agents,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Detection and Estimation, Distributed Inferece, Human-Machine Systems, Reliable Systems","Distributed inference using multiple sensors has been an active area of research since the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Several researchers have addressed the design issues to ensure optimal inference performance in such networks. The central goal of this thesis is to analyze distributed inference systems with potentially unreliable components and design strategies to ensure reliable inference in such systems. The inference process can be that of detection or estimation or classification, and the components/agents in the system can be sensors and/or humans. The system components can be unreliable due to a variety of reasons: faulty sensors, security attacks causing sensors to send falsified information, or unskilled human workers sending imperfect information. This thesis first quantifies the effect of such unreliable agents on the inference performance of the network and then designs schemes that ensure a reliable overall inference.In the first part of this thesis, we study the case when only sensors are present in the system, referred to as sensor networks. For sensor networks, the presence of malicious sensors, referred to as Byzantines, are considered. Byzantines are sensors that inject false information into the system. In such systems, the effect of Byzantines on the overall inference performance is characterized in terms of the optimal attack strategies. Game-theoretic formulations are explored to analyze two-player interactions.Next, Byzantine mitigation schemes are designed that address the problem from the system's perspective. These mitigation schemes are of two kinds: Byzantine identification schemes and Byzantine tolerant schemes. Using learning based techniques, Byzantine identification schemes are designed that learn the identity of Byzantines in the network and use this information to improve system performance. When such schemes are not possible, Byzantine tolerant schemes using error-correcting codes are developed that tolerate the effect of Byzantines and maintain good performance in the network. Error-correcting codes help in correcting the erroneous information from these Byzantines and thereby counter their attack.The second line of research in this thesis considers humans-only networks, referred to as human networks. A similar research strategy is adopted for human networks where, the effect of unskilled humans sharing beliefs with a central observer called \emph{CEO} is analyzed, and the loss in performance due to the presence of such unskilled humans is characterized. This problem falls under the family of problems in information theory literature referred to as the \emph{CEO Problem}, but for belief sharing. The asymptotic behavior of the minimum achievable mean squared error distortion at the CEO is studied in the limit when the number of agents $L$ and the sum rate $R$ tend to infinity.An intermediate regime of performance between the exponential behavior in discrete CEO problems and the$1/R$ behavior in Gaussian CEO problems is established. This result can be summarized as the fact that sharing beliefs (uniform) is fundamentally easier in terms of convergence rate than sharing measurements (Gaussian), but sharing decisions is even easier (discrete).Besides theoretical analysis, experimental results are reported for experiments designed in collaboration with cognitive psychologists to understand the behavior of humans in the network. The act of fusing decisions from multiple agents is observed for humans and the behavior is statistically modeled using hierarchical Bayesian models. The implications of such modeling on the design of large human-machine systems is discussed. Furthermore, an error-correcting codes based scheme is proposed to improve system performance in the presence of unreliable humans in the inference process. For a crowdsourcing system consisting of unskilled human workers providing unreliable responses, the scheme helps in designing easy-to-perform tasks and also mitigates the effect of erroneous data. The benefits of using the proposed approach in comparison to the majority voting based approach are highlighted using simulated and real datasets.In the final part of the thesis, a human-machine inference framework is developed where humans and machines interact to perform complex tasks in a faster and more efficient manner. A mathematical framework is built to understand the benefits of human-machine collaboration. Such a study is extremely important for current scenarios where humans and machines are constantly interacting with each other to perform even the simplest of tasks. While machines perform best in some tasks, humans still give better results in tasks such as identifying new patterns. By using humans and machines together, one can extract complete information about a phenomenon of interest. Such an architecture, referred to as Human-Machine Inference Networks (HuMaINs), provides promising results for the two cases of human-machine collaboration: \emph{machine as a coach} and \emph{machine as a colleague}. For simple systems, we demonstrate tangible performance gains by such a collaboration which provides design modules for larger, and more complex human-machine systems. However, the details of such larger systems needs to be further explored."
etd_575,Religiosity in Secular Spaces: Perinatal Bereavement Rituals in the Hospital,Religion,"Biopower, Feminist theory, Religiosity, Ritual, Space, Stillbirth","Perinatal bereavement rituals developed within hospitals in the late 1970s, broadly coinciding with the historical movements surrounding hospice and palliative care, abortion, women’s reproductive health and the critique of the medical model of pregnancy and childbirth in the US. Bathing, holding and spending time with the baby are examples of these rituals which have subsequently become institutionalized as the standard of care in hospitals. This study is inspired by the question, why are these highly developed and nuanced birth/death rituals, created predominantly by nurses and counselors in hospitals, largely absent from religious spaces, traditions and ritual practice? I argue that perinatal bereavement practices are in fact rituals, indicative of what philosopher Michel Foucault named ‘biopower’ and disrupt the supposed divide between science and religion. Given the central place of women’s pregnant and birthing bodies in the context of religious rituals for women, I outline where feminist theories of pregnant embodiment stand in relation to traditional forms of Judaism and Christianity, as well as biomedicine, itself a tradition with a complex androcentric history. I elaborate the idea of ritual as a process of invention and critique in order to understand perinatal bereavement practices as new ritual forms. I examine Bioethics as a disciplinary perspective which informs the ethics surrounding these rituals and frames the decisions and discourse of the nursing community; I suggest “technologies of ethical proceduralism” as an outcome of the breakdown between ethical theory and ethical practice in healthcare. The will to health and desire to train women how to most effectively heal after this tragic, often unexpected loss is the entry point for my analysis of Foucauldian biopower. Last, the physical, spatial location of the hospital as the site of perinatal losses and their commemoration pulls the study back to concerns regarding the spatial dimension of religiosity and ritual in secular spaces. The hospital as a pluripotent, heterotopic space is not a contested religious space and therefore capable and ideally neutral in its secularity for the innovation of diverse new rituals. As a qualitative, theoretical study of the recent phenomenon of mourning perinatal loss, this dissertation draws attention to the line between ritualization and automation in perinatal loss clinical aftercare despite the power these rituals have to transform “fetal wastage” into the remains of the beloved dead child."

My dissertation examines one of the most significant developments in American political history--the shift of the U.S. political parties on racial issues. In Relocation and Realignment: How the Great Migration changed the face of the Democratic Party, I argue that increasing competition between the parties for the presidency and the mass movement of Black people out of the South coincided to drive the Democratic Party's change on racial issues. Through examination of primary sources and a fresh perspective on existing research, I show that the Democratic Party changed their stance in an effort to secure support from Black voters in the North--who often constituted the balance of power (BOP) in important elections. Relocation and Realignment is an important contribution to the study of American politics for its attention to the political impact of the Great Migration and for its focus on Black voters before the Voting Rights Act of 1965."

The disaster of Hurricane Katrina was mediated to a national audience, setting the stage for specific responses to take place. This thesis provides a rhetorical analysis of one recovery effort waged in the wake of governmental failures to address Katrina and its aftermath. The Make It Right Foundation (MIR) offers a unique case study in the neoliberal dynamics of celebrity philanthropy as an answer to inadequate governmental support for populations adversely affected by natural and human-made disasters. I understand the work of MIR in terms of processes that I term “disaster architecture,” neoliberal in their substitution of good design for good public policy, serving to render an ideal citizen whose obligated gratefulness for aid is directed not toward the state, but toward celebrities, architects, and private donors.This thesis intervenes primarily with the rhetorics of aid taken up by MIR and organizations like it following disasters demanding a nationwide response. I critique MIR’s rhetorics of aid as expressed in writing, visual design, and material construction of the built environment for what I deem to be its failed attempts at providing the Lower Ninth Ward with a sustainable and just path to full recovery from the unequally disastrous effects of the hurricane. With this critique, I hope to contribute to work that encourages more systemic, structurally-focused, and rhetorically responsible work in (re)development processes of philanthropic aid in the built environment."

Originallydefined by Auslander and Bridger, an R-order is an R-algebra which is a maximal CohenMacaulayR-module. In this thesis we consider orders, ?, over Cohen-Macaulay local ringsR possessing a canonical module, ?R. In this case a great deal of structure is imposed on ?.In Chapter 3 we focus on the use of orders as noncommutative resolutions of commutativelocal rings. This idea was introduced by Van den Bergh [45] for R Gorenstein and weinvestigate the generalization to the case where R is Cohen-Macaulay. We show that ifan order is totally reflexive over R and has finite global dimension, then R was alreadyGorenstein. Further, we investigate Gorenstein orders and give a necessary and sufficientcondition for the endomorphism ring EndR(R ? ?) to be a Gorenstein order.The rest of the thesis focuses on various aspects of the representation theory of orders.We investigate orders which have finite global dimension on the punctured spectrum, butare not necessarily isolated singularities. In this case we are able to prove a generalizationof Auslander’s theorem about finite CM type [3]. We prove that if an order which satisfiesprojdim?op ?? 6 n possesses only finitely many indecomposable nth syzygies of MCM ?-modules, then in fact gldim ?p 6 n + dim Rp for all non-maximal primes p. We are thenable to translate this to a condition on R by considering path algebras, since these maintainfiniteness of global dimension.Finally, we consider orders which are true isolated singularities and Iyama’s higherAuslander-Reiten theory [27]. We consider the action of ?n on n-orthogonal subcategoriesof CM ? and on n-cluster tilting subcategories. For the former we are able to characterizethe projective dimension of duals of modules. For the latter, we provide an obstruction to amodule being ?n-periodic, a question of great interest for the representation theory of ordersof finite global dimension."
etd_138,REPUTATION COMPUTATION IN SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Bayesian Game theory, Degree Estimation, Reputation Computation, Social Networks","This thesis focuses on a quantification of reputation and presents models which compute reputation within networked environments. Reputation manifests past behaviors of users and helps others to predict behaviors of users and therefore reduce risks in future interactions. There are two approaches in computing reputation on networks- namely, the macro-level approach and the micro-level approach. A macro-level assumes that there exists a computing entity outside of a given network who can observe the entire network including degree distributions and relationships among nodes. In a micro-level approach, the entity is one of the nodes in a network and therefore can only observe the information local to itself, such as its own neighbors behaviors. In particular, we study reputation computation algorithms in online distributed environments such as social networks and develop reputation computation algorithms to address limitations of existing models. We analyze and discuss some properties of reputation values of a large number of agents including power-law distribution and their diffusion property. Computing reputation of another within a network requires knowledge of degrees of its neighbors. We develop an algorithm for estimating degrees of each neighbor. The algorithm considers observations associated with neighbors as a Bernoulli trial and repeatedly estimate degrees of neighbors as a new observation occurs. We experimentally show that the algorithm can compute the degrees of neighbors more accurately than a simple counting of observations. Finally, we design a bayesian reputation game where reputation is used as payoffs. The game theoretic view of reputation computation reflects another level of reality in which all agents are rational in sharing reputation information of others. An interesting behavior of agents within such a game theoretic environment is that cooperation- i.e., sharing true reputation information- emerges without an explicit punishment mechanism nor a direct reward mechanisms."

Combined with the fact that the spectrum is limited and scarce, the performance and reliability of wireless systems signi?cantly deteriorates and, hence, communication sessions are put at the risk of failure. In an attempt to make transmissions resilient to interference and, accordingly, design robust wireless systems, a diverse set of interference mitigation techniques are investigated in this dissertation.Depending on the rationale motivating the interfering node, interference can be divided into two categories, communication and jamming. For communication interference such as the interference created by legacy users(e.g., primary user transmitters in a cognitive radio network) at non-legacy or unlicensed users(e.g.,secondary user receivers), two mitigation techniques are presented in this dissertation. One exploits permutation trellis codes combined with M-ary frequency shift keying in order to make SU transmissions resilient to PUs’ interference, while the other utilizes frequency allocation as a mitigation technique against SU interference using Matching theory. For jamming interference, two mitigation techniques are also investigated here. One technique exploits time and structures a jammer mitigation framework through an automatic repeat request protocol. The other one utilizes power and, following a game-theoretic framework, employs a defense strategy against jamming based on a strategic power allocation. Superior performance of all of the proposed mitigation techniques is shown via numerical results."
etd_441,Resource Management for Distributed Estimation via Sparsity-Promoting Regularization,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"convex optimization, distributed estimation, resource management, sparsity, wireless sensor networks","Recent advances in wireless communications and electronics have enabled the development of low-cost, low-power, multifunctional sensor nodes that are small in size and communicate untethered in a sensor network. These sensor nodes can sense, measure, and gather information from the environment and, based on some local processing, they transmit the sensed data to a fusion center that is responsible for making the global inference. Sensor networks are often tasked to perform parameter estimation; example applications include battlefield surveillance, medical monitoring, and navigation. However, under limited resources, such as limited communication bandwidth and sensor battery power, it is important to design an energy-efficient estimation architecture. The goal of this thesis is to provide a fundamental understanding and characterization of the optimal tradeoffs between estimation accuracy and resource usage in sensor networks.In the thesis, two basic issues of resource management are studied, sensor selection/scheduling and sensor collaboration for distributed estimation, where the former refers to finding the best subset of sensors to activate for data acquisition in order to minimize the estimation error subject to a constraint on the number of activations, and the latter refers to seeking the optimal inter-sensor communication topology and energy allocation scheme for distributed estimation systems. Most research on resource management so far has been based on several key assumptions, a) independence of observation, b) strict resource constraints, and c) absence of inter-sensor communication, which lend analytical tractability to the problem but are often found lacking in practice. This thesis introduces novel techniques to relax these assumptions and provide new insights into addressing resource management problems.The thesis analyzes how noise correlation affects solutions of sensor selection problems, and proposes both a convex relaxation approach and a greedy algorithm to find these solutions. Compared to the existing sensor selection approaches that are limited to the case of uncorrelated noise or weakly correlated noise, the methodology proposed in this thesis is valid for any arbitrary noise correlation regime. Moreover, this thesis shows a correspondence between active sensors and the nonzero columns of an estimator gain matrix. Based on this association, a sparsity-promoting optimization framework is established, where the desire to reduce the number of selected sensors is characterized by a sparsity-promoting penalty term in the objective function. Instead of placing a hard constraint on sensor activations, the promotion of sparsity leads to trade-offs between estimation performance and the number of selected sensors. To account for the individual power constraint of each sensor, a novel sparsity-promoting penalty function is presented to avoid scenarios in which the same sensors are successively selected. For solving the proposed optimization problem, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which allows the optimization problem to be decomposed into subproblems that can be solved analytically to obtain exact solutions.The problem of sensor collaboration arises when inter-sensor communication is incorporated in sensor networks, where sensors are allowed to update their measurements by taking a linear combination of the measurements of those they interact with prior to transmission to a fusion center. In this thesis, a sparsity-aware optimization framework is presented for the joint design of optimal sensor collaboration and selection schemes, where the cost of sensor collaboration is associated with the number of nonzero entries of a collaboration matrix, and the cost of sensor selection is characterized by the number of nonzero rows of the collaboration matrix. It is shown that a) the presence of sensor collaboration smooths out the observation noise, thereby improving the quality of the signal and eventual estimation performance, and b) there exists a trade-off between sensor selection and sensor collaboration. This thesis further addresses the problem of sensor collaboration for the estimation of time-varying parameters in dynamic networks that involve, for example, time-varying observation gains and channel gains. Impact of parameter correlation and temporal dynamics of sensor networks on estimation performance is illustrated from both theoretical and practical points of view. Last but not least, optimal energy allocation and storage control polices are designed in sensor networks with energy-harvesting nodes. We show that the resulting optimization problem can be solved as a special nonconvex problem, where the only source of nonconvexity can be isolated to a constraint that contains the difference of convex functions. This specific problem structure enables the use of a convex-concave procedure to obtain a near-optimal solution."
etd_475,Response Modulation Moderates the Effect of Agonistic Striving on Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children,Psychology,"Agonistic Striving, Cardiovascular Disease, emotion regulation","Psychological and physiological risk indices in youth may mark early trajectories to adult cardiovascular disease. The present study tested the hypotheses that: (1) children who exhibit agonistic striving (struggling to influence, control, or change other people) exhibit increased cardiovascular risk relative to their peers; (2) children whose parents exhibit agonistic striving exhibit similar risk; and (3) the associations between agonistic striving and cardiovascular risk are moderated by the child’s response modulation abilities. Participants were 100 children aged 9 to 11 years (M = 10.61, SD = 0.86) and 100 parents/caregivers. Agonistic striving was measured with the Social Competence Interview; response modulation abilities were measured with: (a) a self-report index of emotion regulation, and (b) heart rate variability. Cardiovascular risk was indexed by levels of resting blood pressure, cardiovascular reactivity, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular mass of the heart. The results replicated the striving profiles observed previously in adolescents and adults. Indices of increased cardiovascular risk were associated with parent but not child agonistic striving. The degree of a parent’s agonistic goal focus interacted with the level of the child’s emotion regulation abilities and autonomic vagal control to predict higher levels of resting blood pressure and arterial stiffness in the child. Those at greatest risk were children with lower emotion regulation abilities or lower autonomic vagal control, and whose parents exhibited a high degree of agonistic focus. This study offers important new evidence that a psychological mechanism of parental stress may interact with regulatory mechanisms in the child to impair the child’s health."

The resultant increases in pH in these waters has coincided with increased dissolved organic carbon concentrations, which is also correlated with increases in both total mercury and methylmercury concentrations. Understanding how ecosystem mercury dynamics respond to recovery from acid deposition has important implications for fisheries and human exposure. Honnedaga Lake is one of seven lakes in the Adirondack Park of New York State with a heritage Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) population, making the bioavailability and trophic transfer of mercury (Hg) a particular concern. Lime was applied to a tributary watershed of Honnedaga Lake in 2013 in an effort to accelerate biological recovery from acid deposition. Significant increases in DOC, THg and MeHg were evident in streamwater after treatment (maximum THg post-treatment=5.5 ng/L, maximum THg reference=2.15 ng/L). Six months after treatment, there was no significant difference in MeHg concentrations from reference values, while DOC and THg remained significantly higher than pre-treatment and reference values. This pattern suggests that Hg is leaching at elevated levels from the treated watershed, but that short-lived increases in MeHg could not be sustained due to limitations in either the net methylation rate or the transport of MeHg to the stream."
etd_734,"RETHINKING ENTREPRENEURS’ CHARACTERISTICS IN THE CONTEXTS OF FAMILY, INVESTORS, AND THEIR EARLY ACTIONS",Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises,"Entrepreneurship, Human Capital, Individual Characteristics","This study seeks to understand the pathways of how an entrepreneur’s characteristics influence organizational outcomes. Entrepreneur’s characteristics have long been a central focus of entrepreneurship and strategy research (Cooper et al, 1994; Crook et al, 2011). Upper echelon theory, for instance, argues for the significant and direct impact of top management or an entrepreneur’ characteristics on organizational performance (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Yet entrepreneurship is no longer a purely individual undertaking; its outcomes, rather, are contextualized. Accordingly, this study focuses on how organizational outcomes will differ depending on which pathways an entrepreneur takes throughout his or her entrepreneurial endeavors. To advance this analysis, three variables, which determine the pathways, will be considered. The determining variables are the internal relationships amongst team members; the external relationships with investors; and the chosen actions that the entrepreneur takes.  These variables influence an entrepreneur in creating new ventures and have a substantive impact upon an entrepreneur’s cognition and behavior, as well as the outcomes of a new venture. These are the key questions which motivate my dissertation.In Chapter 1, I focus on the first variable: internal relationships amongst team members. This chapter investigates how various types of an entrepreneur’s characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, education, industry experience, and founding experience) are influenced by the internal relationships between team members and highlights the importance of these relationships in the development of a new venture. This study explores particularly how familial relationships among team members diminish the impact of team diversity, created by entrepreneurs’ different characteristics, upon new venture development. This analysis represents a new direction in the literature on team diversity by considering relational embeddedness (Granovetter, 1985) beyond the workplace, a factor which has received scant attention in the literature on teams (Schjoedt et al., 2013). Chapter 2 focuses on the second variable: external relationships with investors. I interrogate the interactions between an entrepreneur’s characteristics and his or her external relationships, aware that these relationships are critical in helping new ventures overcome liabilities stemming from newness (Stinchcombe, 1965; Baum, Calabrese, & Silverman, 2000). This study demonstrates that each aspect of an entrepreneur’ human capital (education, industry experience, and founding experience) has a different impact across resource acquisition stages, and the relationships between prominent investors interact with an entrepreneur’ human capital in later funding stages. This paper advances a dynamic, temporal perspective of the signaling effects of different organizational characteristics. In Chapter 3, I focus on how the different aspects of an entrepreneur’s human capital (education, industry experience, and founding experience) influence an entrepreneur’s cognition, and trigger his or her idiosyncratic behaviors such as planning, actions, and inaction. This study shows that the entrepreneur’s idiosyncratic behaviors, rather than the entrepreneur’ human capital, result in distinct implications for firm performance in new venture creation."
etd_10,Retrieval of Free Space Radiation Patterns through Measured Data in a Non-Anechoic Environment,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"anechoic chamber, antenna measurement, deconvolution, pattern reconstruction, radiation pattern","Antenna pattern measurements are usually carried out in an anechoic chamber. However, a good anechoic chamber is very expensive to construct. Previous research has attempted to compensate for the effects of extraneous fields measured in a non-anechoic environment to obtain a free space pattern that would be measured in an anechoic chamber. Existing compensation techniques are like the Test Zone Field compensation method, the Fast-Fourier-Transform-based method, the Matrix Pencil method, and the Antenna Pattern Comparison technique.This work illustrates and extends a deconvolution methodology which allows the antenna measurement under a non-anechoic test environment and retrieves the free space radiation pattern of an antenna through this measured data; this allows for easier and more affordable antenna measurements.In this work, we modeled the extraneous fields as the system impulse response of the test environment and utilized a reference antenna to extract the impulse response. Then, we used it to remove the extraneous fields for a desired antenna measured under the same environment and retrieved the ideal pattern. The advantage of this process is that it does not require calculating the time delay to gate out the reflections; therefore, it is independent of the bandwidth of the antenna, and there is no requirement for prior knowledge of the test environment.This work contributes to the field not by proposing a new methodology for pattern reconstruction but by showing that the deconvolution methodology can analytically remove the effects of extraneous fields in antenna pattern measurements and by extending this method to antenna pattern measurements under three-dimensional environments. Also, a discussion of the parameters that affect the deconvolution methodology is given in this work. Extensive simulation examples with different environmental settings and with different antennas are presented in this work to demonstrate the applicability of the deconvolution method."
geo_etd_77,"Returning the Commons: Resource Access and Environmental Governance in San Luis, Colorado",Geography,"Land rights, Sangre de Cristo Land Grant","In Lobato v. Taylor (2002) the Colorado Supreme Court awarded Hispano heirs to the 1843 Mexican-era Sangre de Cristo Land Grant returned access to formerly communal land known as La Sierra, the Taylor Ranch, or today Cielo Vista Ranch. The 77,000 acre parcel of mountainous land remains privately owned, yet through Lobato over 4,000 individuals have been awarded legal rights to access the land for the ""reasonable use"" of pastures and forests for grazing, firewood, and timber. Based on roughly 15 months of ethnographic research in collaboration with the Land Rights Council and based in San Luis, CO, this dissertation examines struggles to access, use, and govern the commons from the 1860s to 2011. Part I of the dissertation traces the iterative reproduction of property and sovereign authority through struggles over resource access and use on the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant. I show how Lobato v. Taylor has contributed to the reproduction of U.S. sovereign authority and private property even as it awarded access rights to the commons. Part II examines struggles to govern the commons after 2002, illustrating how configurations of sovereignty, property, law, identity, and nature have shaped resource access and use. I find that private property and legal individualism are central to contemporary resource access and use in ways that have hindered effective procedures for environmental governance, monitoring, and enforcement. Throughout the study, I advance an analysis of the ways in which socio-spatial formations are iteratively reproduced and challenged in contingent and contested ways through the governance of the commons."
geo_etd_80,"Rights in Transit: Public Transportation and the ""Right to the City"" in California's East Bay",Geography,"Labor, Public Transit, Rights, Right to the City, Transportation Geography, Urban Geography","In recent years, a number of researchers in geography and in urban studies have taken to the idea of the ""right to the city."" These scholars have drawn on the idea to frame debates on topics as wide ranging as urban social movements, the regulation of urban public space, to the relationship between cities and citizenship. Implicit in this literature is a conception of the city and of urban space in which political conflict and class struggle are dominating features. This dissertation seeks to add to that discussion by focusing on debates over transit policy in California's East Bay. In addition to contributing to scholarship on the right to the city, this dissertation also broadly encroaches upon work in transportation geography. Drawing on three months of fieldwork, this dissertation makes two arguments. First, it argues that debates over rights ought to matter for those interested in the geography of urban transportation, and second, it argues for seeing urban mass transit as central to securing a right to the city. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with transit activists and a focus group with transit dependent riders, I highlight the degree to which the democratic rights of many East Bay residents hinge upon transit access. For many of these residents, a right to the city means a right to transit. Across six chapters of the dissertation, I also focus more broadly on the relationship between transit policy and conflicts over rights -- whether these conflicts take the form of labor disputes or civil rights lawsuits. These conflicts, I argue, have shaped the geography of transit in the region. While the dissertation highlights the importance of rights and the right to the city for understanding both the geography of urban transit, as well as transit's role in the public life of cities, it also highlights some of the challenges and contradictions associated with the idea of the right to the city. Toward the end of the dissertation I address these challenges and contradictions head-on by arguing for understanding the right to the city as a right against the ""idiocy of urban life."""
etd_157,Rigidity and Fluidity in Living and Nonliving Matter,Physics,"cell migration, granular material, Hyperbolic lattices, Jamming, jamming graph, percolation","Many of the standard equilibrium statistical mechanics techniques do not readily apply to non-equilibrium phase transitions such as the fluid-to-disordered solid transition found in repulsive particulate systems. Examples of repulsive particulate systems are sand grains and colloids. The first part of this thesis contributes to methods beyond equilibrium statistical mechanics to ultimately understand the nature of the fluid-to-disordered solid transition, or jamming, from a microscopic basis.In Chapter 2 we revisit the concept of minimal rigidity as applied to frictionless, repulsive soft sphere packings in two dimensions with theintroduction of the jamming graph. Minimal rigidity is a purely combinatorial property encoded via Laman's theorem in two dimensions. It constrains the global, average coordination number of the graph, for instance. Minimal rigidity, however, does not address the geometry of localmechanical stability. The jamming graph contains both properties of global mechanical stability at the onset of jamming and local mechanical stability. We demonstrate how jamming graphs can be constructed using local rules via the Henneberg construction such that these graphs are of the constraint percolation type, where percolation is the study of connected structures in disordered networks. We then probe how jamming graphs destabilize, or become fluid-like, by deleting an edge/contact in the graph and computing the resulting rigid cluster distribution. We also uncover a new potentially diverging lengthscale associated with the random deletion of contacts.In Chapter 3 we study several constraint percolation models, such as k-core percolation and counter-balance percolation, on hyperbolic lattices to better understand the role of loops in such models. The constraints in these percolation models incorporate aspects of local mechanical rigidity found in jammed systems. The expectation is that since these models are indeed easier to analyze than the more complicated problem of jamming, we will gain insight into which constraints affect the nature of the jamming transition and which do not. We find that k = 3-core percolation on the hyperbolic lattice remains a continuous phase transition despite the fact that the loop structure of hyperbolic lattices is different from Euclidean lattices. We also contribute towards numerical techniques for analyzing percolation on hyperbolic lattices.In Chapters 4 and 5 we turn to living matter, which is also nonequilibrium in a very local way in that each constituent has its own internal energy supply. In Chapter 4 we study the fluidity of a cell moving through a confluent tissue, i.e. a group of cells with no gaps between them, via T1 transitions. A T1 transition allows for an edge swap so that a cell can come into contact with new neighbors. Cell migration is then generated by a sequence of such swaps. In a simple four cell system we compute the energy barriers associated with this transition. We then find that the energy barriers in a larger system are rather similar to the four cell case. The many cell case, however, more easily allows for the collection of statistics of these energy barriers given the disordered packings of cell observed in  experiments. We find that the energy barriers are exponentially distributed. Such a finding implies that glassy dynamics is possible in a confluent tissue.Finally, in chapter 5 we turn to single cell migration in the extracellular matrix, another native environment of a cell. Experiments suggest that the migration of some cells in the three-dimensional ext ra cellular matrix bears strong resemblance to one-dimensional cell migration. Motivated by this observation, we construct and study a minimal one-dimensional model cell made of two beads and an active spring moving along a rigid track. The active spring models the stress fibers with their myosin-driven contractility and alpha-actinin-driven extendability, while the friction coefficients of the two beads describe the catch/slip bond behavior of the integrins in focal adhesions. Net motion arises from an interplay between active contractility (and passive extendability) of the stress fibers and an asymmetry between the front and back of the cell due to catch bond behavior of integrins at the front of the cell and slip bond behavior of integrins at the back. We obtain reasonable cell speeds with independently estimated parameters. Our model highlights the role of alpha-actinin in three-dimensional cell motility and does not require Arp2/3 actin filament nucleation for net motion."
etd_582,Risk-Aware Planning for Sensor Data Collection,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"With the emergence of low-cost unmanned air vehicles, civilian and military organizations are quickly identifying new applications for affordable, large-scale collectives to support and augment human efforts via sensor data collection. In order to be viable, these collectives must be resilient to the risk and uncertainty of operating in real-world environments. Previous work in multi-agent planning has avoided planning for the loss of agents in environments with risk. In contrast, this dissertation presents a problem formulation that includes the risk of losing agents, the effect of those losses on the mission being executed, and provides anticipatory planning algorithms that consider risk. We conduct a thorough analysis of the effects of risk on path-based planning, motivating new solution methods. We then use hierarchical clustering to generate risk-aware plans for a variable number of agents, outperforming traditional planning methods. Next, we provide a mechanism for distributed negotiation of stable plans, utilizing coalitional game theory to provide cost allocation methods that we prove to be fair and stable. Centralized planning with redundancy is then explored, planning for parallel task completion to mitigate risk and provide further increased expected value. Finally, we explore the role of cost uncertainty as additional source of risk, using bi-objective optimization to generate sets of alternative plans. We demonstrate the capability of our algorithms on randomly generated problem instances, showing an improvement over traditional multi-agent planning methods as high as 500% on very large problem instances."
etd_602,ROBUST KULLBACK-LEIBLER DIVERGENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN UNIVERSAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND DEVIATION DETECTION,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,"The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is one of the most fundamental metrics in information theory and statistics and provides various operational interpretations in the context of mathematical communication theory and statistical hypothesis testing. The KL divergence for discrete distributions has the desired continuity property which leads to some fundamental results in universal hypothesis testing. With continuous observations, however, the KL divergence is only lower semi-continuous; difficulties arise when tackling universal hypothesis testing with continuous observations due to the lack of continuity in KL divergence.This dissertation proposes a robust version of the KL divergence for continuous alphabets. Specifically, the KL divergence defined from a distribution to the Levy ball centered at the other distribution is found to be continuous. This robust version of the KL divergence allows one to generalize the result in universal hypothesis testing for discrete alphabets to that for continuous observations. The optimal decision rule is developed whose robust property is provably established for universal hypothesis testing.Another application of the robust KL divergence is in deviation detection: the problem of detecting deviation from a nominal distribution using a sequence of independent and identically distributed observations. An asymptotically -optimal detector is then developed for deviation detection where the Levy metric becomes a very natural distance measure for deviation from the nominal distribution.Lastly, the dissertation considers the following variation of a distributed detection problem: a sensor may overhear other sensors' transmissions and thus may choose to refine its output in the hope of achieving a better detection performance. While this is shown to be possible for the fixed sample size test, asymptotically (in the number of samples) there is no performance gain, as measured by the KL divergence achievable at the fusion center, provided that the observations are conditionally independent. For conditionally dependent observations, however, asymptotic detection performance may indeed be improved when overhearing is utilized."
etd_648,Role of Information Technology in Policy Implementation of Maternal Health Benefits in India,Public Administration,"JSSK, JSY, Maternal Health in India, Melghat, Mobile Phones, Policy Implementation","Fifty thousand women died during childbirth in India in 2013, the highest total in the world; that is, one maternal death every 10 minutes. India and Nigeria account for almost one-third of total global maternal deaths. In pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals, the government of India directed efforts to improve maternal health and was able to reduce maternal mortality rate from 437 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 140 per 100,000 in 2015, albeit missing the target of 109. Moreover, estimates for maternal morbidity are three to four times that of the mortality rates with even more pronounced regional disparities. Universal access to free public healthcare for maternal health has been a national goal since 2005, but its quality of service and utilization rate of maternal healthcare remains an elusive dream for many of the rural women even after a decade of substantial efforts.In a stark contrast, mobile technology has become more pervasive than the most basic infrastructure across the world. There are over 7 billion mobile phones subscriptions worldwide, but only 4.5 billion people have access to basic sanitation facilities, implying more people have access to mobile phones than toilets in the world, including India. The ubiquity of mobile phones can no longer be ignored. According to the 2011 census of India, 47 percent of the rural households owned mobile phones, and mobile phone network coverage spanned over 99 percent of the rural landscape, but only 31 percent of these rural households had a toilet.This exponential growth in mobile phone ownerships and adaptation has captured the imagination of academic scholars, public administration and the private sector to push for mobile based solutions and services in almost every aspect of public, social and personal life. M-governance has gained prominence too, aimed at improving service delivery, transparency, policy monitoring, public engagement, combatting corruption and poverty, especially in the developing world, leap-frogging poor-resource and low-income constraints. Today there is a mobile app for everything and the solution to any problem is a mobile app, including maternal health.However, amidst this optimism, it is surprising that the potential of mobile phones to improve social policy awareness is yet to be fully exploited. There are initiatives toward health literacy and mobile based cash transfers but few initiatives are geared toward improving awareness of social welfare policies, informing people about eligibility, enrollment and entitlements. Here lies the uniqueness of this research. Motivated to find solutions to actual policy implementation problems in practice, this research lies at the intersection of information communication technology, maternal health benefit policies and public management. In India, low maternal health benefits policy awareness imposes an administrative burden on rural women and leads to uptake of cash and public health service benefits. This research explores if mobile phones can be used as an effective medium to increase maternal health benefit awareness; thereby increasing the claiming of benefits.Using mixed methods of research, insights are drawn from a longitudinal case study in Melghat, a tribal belt of Amravati District in Maharashtra, India; a region that suffers from high maternal morbidity and high infant mortality rate. Forty-two percent of total childbirths take place in the home despite four different maternal benefit policies promoting institutional delivery and safe motherhood. In this dissertation, customized audio messages about maternal healthcare benefit policies were designed and broadcasted to 82 pregnant tribal women and followed up with qualitative interviews to examine any improvements in claiming of the policy benefits in 2013. The research provided an in-depth view of how information was disseminated through mobiles phones, and what factors and trade-offs, beyond information, were actually considered by the households in claiming the policy benefits.This research offers four contributions. First, it provides a deeper understanding of maternal health policies, how incentives work and the impact of conditions attached to these incentives, providing a plausible explanation for why the policies remain only partially effective. Second, in an era of m-governance, it illuminates the potential and limitations of the mobile phones in policy implementation and civic engagement, through a gendered lens. Third, it yields a caution to the technological optimistic use of mobile phones. By evaluating the causal mechanism of whether and how information awareness led to greater claiming of benefits, the findings revealed that information awareness alone was insufficient to improve claims when there were structural and systemic deficiencies in the policy design and management. Fourth, it advances the theory of administrative burden, by using mobile phones to reduce learning costs and by expanding the concepts of compliance costs and psychological costs, and highlights the relative interaction and trade-offs between components of administrative burden in an international context. The research concludes that although mobile phones have the potential to trigger demand for policy benefits and public engagement, and reduce learning cost, they are not the “silver bullet” because they cannot bypass the fundamental challenges of other administrative burdens, policy design deficiencies and bureaucratic processes."
etd_255,Role of Self-Efficacy and Experiential Training in Classroom Guidance Participation,Counseling and Human Services,"Classroom Guidance, Experiential Learning, School Counseling, Self-Efficacy","According to the American School Counseling Association (ASCA) school counselors should be spending 15 to 45 percent of their time engaged in classroom guidance (ASCA, 2005; 2012).  Yet there has been little research in the area classroom guidance and understanding what factors impact whether or not school counselors choose to engage in classroom guidance.  This study explored whether factors like self-efficacy, experiential training, and a variety of demographic variables including previous teaching training were significantly correlated to the amount of classroom guidance performed.  The study was a quantitative in nature and was a cross sectional, correlational, survey design.The ASCA membership was judged to be an ideal population to survey since the organization is focused on school counseling and has members across all 50 states.  An invitation to participate in the study was sent to 4985 email addresses of ASCA members and stratified sampling was used to make participation representative across the four geographic regions.  Additionally, this study introduced two new instruments, the first was a measure of self-efficacy related to classroom guidance and was based on previous classroom guidance research by Geltner, Cunningham, &;; Caldwell (2011).   The second instrument measured experiential training in classroom guidance.From the 4985 requests sent out this study yielded 239 usable responses.  The three significant factors related to the amount of classroom guidance performed were self-efficacy related to classroom guidance, school counseling level worked, and caseload.  That self-efficacy related to classroom guidance was significant seems to indicate that when school counselors feel competent working in a classroom, they report actually engaging in more classroom guidance.  In the second significant finding, school counselors working at the elementary level performed, on average, twice as much classroom guidance as their peers in the middle and high school levels.  This finding is in line with previous school counseling literature that showed elementary school counselors are more likely to be practicing in the way they preferred (Scarbough &;; Culbreath, 2008; Scarborough &;; Luke, 2008).  Lastly, the results indicated that as school counselors’ caseloads increase, school counselors are performing more classroom guidance.  This is encouraging because it aligns with school counselor best practice (ASCA, 2005).While more research is needed to explore the areas of classroom guidance.  This study provides a foundation to better understand some of the factors that influence school counselors’ willingness to engage in classroom guidance.  This is especially important considering that classroom guidance plays an important role in any comprehensive developmental school counseling program."
bio_etd_79,Role of the Nla6S and Nla28S histidine kinases in fruiting body development of Myxococcus xanthus,Biology,"Biofilm formation, histidine kinase, Myxococcus xanthus fruiting body formation, two component signal transduction systems","The complex life cycle of Myxococcus xanthus makes it a model organism for studying multicellular developmental processes in bacteria. In response to adverse environmental conditions, M. xanthus aggregates and forms multicellular structures known as fruiting bodies. Two component signal transduction systems (TCS) are widely used by bacteria to detect and respond to environmental cues by regulating large-scale changes in gene expression. They contain a histidine kinase sensor that detects environmental cues and a response regulator that modulates cellular processes. Two key regulators of the early stages of fruiting body development are the Nla6S/Nla6 and Nla28S/Nla28 TCSs. The response regulators of these TCSs, Nla6 and Nla28, are important for the successful completion of fruiting body formation. However, the histidine kinase sensors that modulate the activity of these key response regulators were previously unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of the Nla6S and Nla28S histidine kinases. Analysis of Nla6S reveals that it represents a new family of bacterial histidine kinases. Furthermore, it plays an important role in the M. xanthus life cycle. Analysis of Nla28S shows that this is an important sensor of early developmental events. Our data suggests that Nla28S is involved in sensing the two important events of early development, nutrient depletion and cell density. In response to these signals Nla28S regulates sporulation of M. xanthus. Characterization of Nla6S and Nla28S expands our knowledge of the signaling networks that regulate initiation of the multicellular developmental process of M. xanthus."
bio_etd_80,Roles for Chd7 in Zebrafish Development with Implications for Human Disease,Biology,"CHARGE Syndrome, chd7, development, RNA-Seq, spinal deformity, zebrafish","The Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein (CHD) family consists of a group of nine known proteins that function in controlling DNA dynamics and transcription. The CHD family member of interest in this work, Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (chd7), has been implicated in human CHARGE (coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retardation of growth and/or development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and ear abnormalities and deafness) Syndrome and Idiopathic Scoliosis, however little is known about the roles this gene plays during development.Using zebrafish as a model system, morpholino antisense technology, whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH), and a relatively new protocol, RNA-Seq, we provide evidence of several developmental defects resulting from Chd7 knockdown as well as describe several genes that exhibit significant differential expression upon Chd7 knockdown. We provide evidence that zebrafish embryos highly express chd7 in the retina, brain and somite boundaries. We demonstrate that a reduction in Chd7 synthesis results in laterality defects in the expression of somitogenesis genes, consistent with the hypothesis that this chromatin remodeler is necessary for the proper development of the long axis of the body and may be involved in the onset of human scoliosis. We show that the presence of Chd7 is crucial for proper neural, retinal and vertebral development in zebrafish and that loss of function of Chd7 resulted in several morphological defects similar to those observed in human patients with CHARGE syndrome.Finally, this work is the first transcriptome-wide study analyzing genetic changes in response to knockdown of a member of the Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein family. Using RNA-Seq we were able to identify and quantify differentially expressed genes in chd7 morphant zebrafish embryos compared to control morphant zebrafish embryos. These data were consistent with our knockdown experiments as well as with putative roles for Chd7 in human diseases.In an effort to make a broader impact, we extended the use of zebrafish beyond scientific research and described several different methods of using zebrafish in the undergraduate laboratory classroom. First, we described the use of WISH in the classroom to help students form connections between molecular and organismal biology and then described the use of two model organisms, zebrafish and C. elegans, in the classroom to help students understand how genes and the environment interact to affect organismal development.Cumulatively, this work is an example of interdisciplinary study both in the research laboratory as well as in the classroom. It involves the intensive study of a chromatin remodeler, Chd7, and makes important connections between Chd7 knockdown in zebrafish and human diseases. It also describes the pedagogical advantages of model organisms with respect to providing a rich and integrative experience for undergraduate biology majors."
etd_294,Romantic Relationship Satisfaction as Predicted by Perceived Family of Origin Experiences and Education,Marriage and Family Therapy,"educational attainment, family of origin satisfaction, relationship satisfaction","This study is an effort to shed light on romantic relationship satisfaction in adulthood in relation to family of origin experiences and educational attainment. Thus far, researchers have shown a positive correlation between adulthood relationship satisfaction and family of origin experiences in childhood. Furthermore, educational attainment seems to have important life long benefits and protective factors for individuals. However, there is a lack of knowledge in the literature as to how well these two variables can predict romantic relationship satisfaction together. In this cross-sectional research study, the researcher tested the hypothesis that educational attainment and positive family of origin experiences may predict romantic relationship satisfaction. Participants were recruited from clients who are currently seeking therapy services at Syracuse University’s Couple and Family Therapy Center. Regression analysis on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) showed that family of origin experiences and educational attainment do not predict romantic relationship satisfaction in this sample. Implication of this result and future research ideas are discussed."

In-depth interviews with 25 sports journalists (reporters and editors) identified the institutionalized norms, values, practices and routines of American sports journalism, demonstrated how that institutionalization affects story selection, and showed how the profession is changing due to digital and social media.  The interviews show that although traditional sports journalism is highly institutionalized, digital sports journalism is far less so.  Traditional sports journalism is still centered around a story, and digital sports journalism follows Robinson's (2011) journalism-as-process model. The journalists interviewed are expected to perform acts of both traditional and digital journalism during the same work day, which leads to tension in how they do their jobs."

Focusing on the National September 11th Memorial & Museum, The National Flight 93 Memorial, and the National Pentagon 9/11 Memorial, my research examines how cultural memory is mediated through the establishment of `places of memory' within the built-environment. Here, I argue, the preservation of place acts as a repository of national memory by safeguarding the history of 9/11 for future generations.  Contextualizing these landscapes of memory within the global war on terrorism, my analytical framework engages the transnational significance of 9/11 memory in a global world.  Accordingly, this research situates 9/11 remembrance within interdisciplinary and cross-border conversations that theorize national practices of preservation and commemoration in relation to transnational flows of people, information, and ideas.  Here, my research articulates the formation of 9/11 memory as a unique `geography of trauma.'  Offering an original contribution to geography, this research theorizes the spatial and temporal movement of traumatic memories across time and space.  Aimed at understanding how these historic sites are mediated in relation to other landscapes of violence and cultural trauma--past and present--my research draws on critical geopolitical theorizations of the nation-state, feminist theories of emotion and embodiment, queer deployments of affect, and cultural theories of memory, as tools for navigating post-structural ideas of power, knowledge, discourse, and empire."
etd_72,"Runners, Biters, and Chair Throwers: Discourses of Order and Medicalization in Inclusion",Cultural Foundations of Education,"Inclusion, Leadership, PBIS, Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports, Response to Intervention, RTI","Inclusive leaders find that one of their greatest challenges is helping their schools to work with students regarded as acting disorderly, or having emotional or behavioral disorders.  In this study, superintendents, special education directors, and principals in five districts in the Northeast who have been previously identified as inclusive leaders were interviewed and observed to document the discourses they promote and are themselves regulated by as they meet this challenge.  They employed the tenets of Response to Intervention (RTI) and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) as systems that would help advance that work.  In particular, they believed that RTI/PBIS could help them effect a shift from dealing with disorderly behavior as a discipline matter to dealing with it as a therapeutic process.   The shift built on disciplinary codes of conduct that established certain behaviors as normal.  Thus, the inclusionary efforts focused on restoring students to compliant behavior.  In so doing, the leaders oversaw the development of intricate systems of data analysis and control that focused exclusively on diagnosing students, rather than on looking at adults or the system as a whole.  These systems privileged psychopathological discourses over other possible ways of understanding the phenomenon of disorder in schools, such as institutional racism, classism, or homophobia. Thus, a discourse that medicalized student difference squeezed out liberatory discourses that may have been available to these leaders.  At the present time, when current efforts to break the school-to-prison pipeline focus on replacing excessive discipline with inclusive pedagogy, this study may serve as a caution not simply to replace one stigmatizing system with another."

This approach utilizes a vinyl silicon tether to provide complete regiocontrol, a stereoselective anti-exo-dig cyclization which affords a tetrasubstituted olefin with a new vinylsilane, and a highly functionalized Z,E diene motif. Subsequent studies for a highly selective intramolecular trans-silylvinylation of internal alkynes catalyzed by RuHCl(CO)(SIMes)(PPh3) is reported. The use of methyl vinyl ketone as an additive increased the efficiency of this transformation. This process was expanded upon using ethylene gas as an additive and provides a net 5-exo-dig trans-silylvinylation of internal alkynes. Ethylene decreased reaction times and promoted altered selectivity at increased pressure. Furthermore, the chemoselectivity was attenuated when alkyl substituted alkynes afforded silylvinylation at 80 psi of ethylene. Terminal alkynes were utilized in this transformation at increased ethylene pressure and produced syn-silylvinylation products.Imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines were synthesized in three steps utilizing a palladium catalyzed amidation-cyclization strategy. N-Aryl substrates were synthesized using copper catalyzed amidation of 3-amino-N-Boc-4-chloropyridine. Complementary protocols for the selective chlorination of imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines at C2 and C7 positions were also developed. An improved protocol for the synthesis of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines and pyrazines using palladium catalyzed amidation of 2-chloro-3-aminopyridines is described. The process utilizes Xantphos and a binary solvent system comprised of 1,4-dioxane and tert-amyl alcohol. The improved conditions were extended to provide a method for the regioselective coupling of polychlorinated aminopyridines."
etd_391,Ruthenium-Catalyzed Transformations for the Synthesis of Conjugated Dienes,Chemistry,,"A general description of transition metal catalysis of alkynes and alkenes for the formation of conjugated dienes is briefly discussed. Specifically, a synopsis of ruthenium-hydride catalysis for the formation of 1,3-dienes is presented.The development of the trans-silylvinylation of internal alkynes with acrylates and vinyl boronates to form conjugated dienes is discussed. This transformation was accomplished via a recently developed tandem silylative coupling using RuHCl(CO)(PCy3)2. The reaction optimization, mechanistic hypothesis and substrate scope for the coupling with acrylates and vinyl boronates is described. The vinyl boronate scope and alkyne scope is presented, in addition to the selective derivatization of the boronate moiety. The synthesis of a chiral silicon-tethered alkyne is described and its application toward a stereo- and enantioselective chiral conjugated diene utilizing the aforementioned methodology was accomplished and is discussed herein.The development of an intramolecular trans-silylvinylation of internal alkynes catalyzed by RuHCl(CO)(H2IMes)(PPh3) with methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) additive is discussed. The substrate scope of the reaction provided five-, six-, and seven-membered oxasilacycles. The ruthenium-hydride catalyzed trans-silylvinylation of internal alkynes under an atmosphere of ethylene gas is discussed. This methodology improved upon the reactivity of the starting alkynes and upon the selectivity of the diene products formed from the previous transformations with MVK additive. Reversal of Z/E selectivity can be obtained with increased pressures of ethylene gas. Further functionalization of the diene products to form more diverse scaffolds is described.Lastly, the cycloisomerization of silicon-tethered 1,7-enynes to form 1,3-dienes utilizing catalytic Cp*Ru(COD)Cl is described herein. The reaction optimization, mechanistic hypothesis, substrate tolerance and synthetic utility is discussed. The question of whether a silicon atom is required in the tether of the starting enyne for the reaction to proceed is addressed."
etd_87,"Schools under Siege: Terror, Security, and the Making of Milton High",Cultural Foundations of Education,"militarization, national security, public schools","The September 11 attacks intensified U.S. issues of security, defense, and protection through practices like increased surveillance, indefinite detention, and zero tolerance policing in its domestic and foreign engagements (Gregory, 2004; Gregory & Pred, 2007). This amplified focus on national in/security has also informed U.S. school reform projects. In 2008, for instance, Milton High School implemented a homeland security studies program as a way to ""boost"" the academic achievement of its students, who were predominately poor and working class youth of color. Milton High School partnered with major defense corporations like Northrop Grumman and government organizations like the National Security Agency to facilitate these efforts. Together, Milton and its partners transformed students' classes to focus on issues of in/security and militarized solutions to terrorism, and to provide pathways to low-level jobs in the security industry.Based on seven months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted at Milton High School, this dissertation intimately examines everyday life in the homeland security program. I map and analyze the social forces that led Milton to adopt a homeland security program, the vocabularies used to talk about threat and insecurity, the kinds of militarized subjectivities the program cultivated, the militarized gender norms celebrated at the school, and students' palpable fears in response to this type of schooling. In turn, this dissertation offers a mediation on how this corporatized, national security-oriented type of education prepared Milton students to defend the homeland; called upon them to make ""ultimate sacrifices"" (Billig, 1995) in the name of national security; and normalized them to the operations, values, and ideologies of the military-security nation that make going to war possible.Ultimately, I argue that through public-private partnerships with the security industry and government organizations, militarization and securitization shaped everyday life at Milton, and that, symbiotically, Milton reproduced and remade this militarization and securitization. Milton's story, thus, provides important insight into one way U.S. public schools organize for the waging of war and the securing of society (Geyer, 1989)."
etd_690,SCIENCE TEACHERS’ UNDERSTANDING AND PRACTICE OF INQUIRY-BASED INSTRUCTION IN UGANDA,Science Teaching,"Inquiry-based instruction, Nature of Science, Practice of inquiry, professional development workshop, Science teacher education, Understanding","High school students in Uganda perform poorly in science subjects despite the Ugandan government’s efforts to train science teachers and build modern science laboratories in many public high schools. The poor performance of students in science subjects has been largely blamed on the inability by many science teachers to teach science through Inquiry-Based Instruction (IBI) to motivate the students to learn science. However, there have been no empirical studies done to establish the factors that influence science teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI in Uganda. Most of the published research on IBI has been conducted in developed countries, where the prevailing contexts are very different from the contexts in developing countries such as Uganda. Additionally, few studies have explored how professional development (PD) training workshops on inquiry and nature of science (NOS) affect chemistry teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI.My purpose in this multi-case exploratory qualitative study was to explore the effect of a PD workshop on inquiry and NOS on chemistry teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI in Kampala city public schools in Uganda. I also explored the relationship between chemistry teachers’ NOS  understanding and the nature of IBI implemented in their classrooms and the internal and external factors that influence teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI. I used a purposive sampling procedure to identify two schools of similar standards from which I selected eight willing chemistry teachers (four from each school) to participate in the study. Half of the teachers (those from School A) attended the PD workshop on inquiry and NOS for six days, while the control group (those from School B) did not. I collected qualitative data through semi-structured interviews, classroom observation, and document analysis. I analyzed these data by structural, conceptual and theoretical coding approach.I established that all the participating chemistry teachers had insufficient understanding of IBI at the beginning of the study. However, teachers from School A improved their understanding and practice of IBI after attending the PD workshop. I also found that the participating chemistry teachers’ NOS epistemological views were, to some extent, related to the nature of IBI implemented in their classroom. The main internal factors the participating teachers perceived to influence their understanding and practice of IBI were their attitudes and teaching experience, whereas the external factors were lack of motivation, lack of necessary instructional materials, mode of assessment, class size, the nature of pre-service and in-service training, support from peer teachers and limited time in relation to many lessons and much content to cover  Based on the above findings, I conclude that the current science teacher training in Uganda may not be improving science teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI, and most of the factors are beyond their control (external). Hence, there is an urgent need for teacher educators and policymakers in Uganda to address the internal and external factors influencing science teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI to improve the teaching and learning of science subjects. Additionally, more quantitative and qualitative studies should be done among teachers of different disciplines to establish how the above factors and others affect teachers’ understanding and practice of IBI in developing countries like Uganda.Keywords: Science teacher education, Understanding, Practice of inquiry, Inquiry-based instruction, professional development workshop, Nature of Science"

The pervasive and detrimental use of alcohol on college campuses inspired calls for wider implementation of empirically supported interventions in college settings. Despite strong evidence of the efficacy of brief interventions, no studies have examined the efficacy and feasibility of integrating a screening and brief intervention (SBI) into college mental health services. The aims of the following study were to (a) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementation and, (b) to examine the short-term impact of SBI on alcohol use, treatment utilization, client satisfaction, and clinical symptoms. Participants were 35 college students who screened positive for risky alcohol use at a college counseling center. Participants were randomly assigned to a brief intervention for alcohol use or to an information-only control group. Follow-up assessments took place 1 and 2 months post-intervention. Participants in the intervention condition significantly reduced drinks per week 1-month post intervention and perceived stress 2-months post-intervention when compared to controls. All participants showed reductions in peak BAC, heavy drinking episodes, and alcohol related problems at 1 and 2-month follow-up assessments. Process measures revealed that only half of providers referred eligible students despite high ratings of feasibility and acceptability of the program. Future research might examine this intervention with a larger sample as well as barriers to dissemination and recruitment among staff. This study is a promising first glance at the integration of SBI for alcohol use in a college counseling setting."

Such images appear to be pervasive today on reality television shows, the most popular television show genre, where many historic negative stereotypes of women of color are conveyed. Social television, the practice of watching television and simultaneously commenting on social media, is now common among viewers. The aim of this research is to determine if the same old stereotypes of women of color on television are finding their way to the new medium of Twitter. This study is a textual analysis of tweets from viewers who watched episodes of seasons one and three one of the Vh1 reality show Basketball Wives LA and the WE TV reality program Mary Mary. Both shows feature women of color in the cast.

etd_73,SEARCHING AS THINKING: THE ROLE OF CUES IN QUERY REFORMULATION,Information Science and Technology,"cues, query reformulation, search engines, user study","Given the growing volume of information that surrounds us, search, and particularly web search, is now a fundamental part of how people perceive and experience the world.  Understanding how searchers interact with search engines is thus an important topic both for designers of information retrieval systems and educators working in the area of digital literacy. Reaching such understanding, however, with the more established, system-centric, approaches in information retrieval (IR) is limited. While inherently iterative nature of the search process is generally acknowledged in the field of IR, research on query reformulation is typically limited to dealing with the ""what"" or the ""how"" of the query reformulation process. Drawing a complete picture of searchers' behavior is thus incomplete without addressing the ""why"" of query reformulation, including what pieces of information, or cues, trigger the reformulation process. Unpacking that aspect of the searchers' behavior requires a more user-centric approach.The overall goal of this study is to advance understanding of the reformulation process and the cues that influence it. It was driven by two broad questions about the use of cues (on the search engine result pages or the full web pages) in the searchers' decisions regarding query reformulation and the effects of that use on search effectiveness. The study draws on data collected in a lab setting from a sample of students who performed a series of search tasks and then went through a process of stimulated recall focused on their query reformulations. Both, query reformulations recorded during the search tasks and cues elicited during the stimulated recall exercise, were coded and then modeled using the mixed effects method. The final models capture the relationships between cues and query reformulation strategies as well as cues and search effectiveness; in both cases some relationships are moderated by search expertise and domain knowledge.The results demonstrate that searchers systematically elicit and use cues with regard to query reformulation. Some of these relationships are independent from search expertise and domain knowledge, while others manifest themselves differently at different levels of search expertise and domain knowledge. Similarly, due to the fact that the majority of the reformulations in this study indicated a failure of the preceding query, mixed results were achieved with identifying relationships between the use of cues and search effectiveness. As a whole, this work offers two contributions to the field of user-centered information retrieval. First, it reaffirms some of the earlier conceptual work about the role of cues in search behavior, and then expands on it by proposing specific relationships between cues and reformulations. Second, it highlights potential design considerations in creating search engine results pages and query term suggestions, as well as and training suggestion for educators working on digital literacy."

Theory and Practice of Religious Politics in Iran and Turkey,Political Science,,"This dissertation functions within the framework of two normative judgments. First, secularism as a modern ideology behind the process of secularization is suffering from a real conceptual and normative crisis. Second, a new understanding of secular standpoint is not only possible but also necessary in order to control and prevent institutionalized religious domination in some sociopolitical contexts. My dissertation is an attempt to provide an argument for such a new understanding of the secular standpoint through a normative comparative study of conventional secularism and contextual secularism in Iran and Turkey. It tries to function both as a diagnostic and synthetic approach, and it captures a position in between normative theorizing and comparative interpretation. This is a normative comparative study of Western secularism, on the one hand, and the nuanced dialectic of imposing the dominant conventional understanding of secularism on two Muslim-majority contexts (Iran and Turkey), on the other."

It is divided intotwo parts. In part I, I present the epistemic access problem for realist moralepistemology, and then argue against several a priori attempts to resolve the problem. Ibegin by defending an understanding of evolutionary debunking arguments accordingto which the problem is grounded in a lack of epistemic access to sui generis, non-causalmoral facts. Next, I argue that even the most sophisticated versions of reflectiveequilibrium fall victim to the “garbage in, garbage out” objection which besetscoherentist theories more generally. I then survey the most influential other a prioriapproaches to epistemic access. I conclude that each of them is victim to some variationof the same dilemma: Either they fail to ensure epistemic access, or they succeed byproviding epistemic access to the wrong properties—viz. not the robustly normativeones.In part II, I defend a wholly a posteriori moral epistemology according to whichour epistemic access to the moral properties is via perceptual experience. I begin with apositive argument that moral properties figure in the contents of perceptual experience,making use of the “method of contrast” found in the philosophy of perceptionliterature. Next, I defend the foundationalist credentials of the perceptualist view inlight of the objection that moral experiences will be epistemically dependent on priorbackground (moral) beliefs. I claim that the epistemic dependence of these moralexperiences depends on the nature of influence the prior beliefs have and that theinfluence is not of the problematic sort. I then discuss the role of emotions in generatingmoral perceptions. I argue that emotions play an essential role in moral perceptualexperiences, but that this is compatible with foundationalism and perceptualism.Finally, I return to the issue of epistemic access, arguing that the perceptual viewprovides an explanation of our epistemic access to the moral properties."
etd_580,Selective Dynamic Analysis of Virtualized Whole-System Guest Environments,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Dynamic binary analysis, Dynamic taint analysis, Emulation, Fuzz testing, Security, Virtualization","Dynamic binary analysis is a prevalent and indispensable technique in program analysis. While several dynamic binary analysis tools and frameworks have been proposed, all suffer from one or more of: prohibitive performance degradation, a semantic gap between the analysis code and the execution under analysis, architecture/OS specificity, being user-mode only, and lacking flexibility and extendability. This dissertation describes the design of the Dynamic Executable Code Analysis Framework (DECAF), a virtual machine-based, multi-target, whole-system dynamic binary analysis framework. In short, DECAF seeks to address the shortcomings of existing whole-system dynamic analysis tools and extend the state of the art by utilizing a combination of novel techniques to provide rich analysis functionality without crippling amounts of execution overhead. DECAF extends the mature QEMU whole-system emulator, a type-2 hypervisor capable of emulating every instruction that executes within a complete guest system environment.DECAF provides a novel, hardware event-based method of just-in-time virtual machine introspection (VMI) to address the semantic gap problem. It also implements a novel instruction-level taint tracking engine at bitwise level of granularity, ensuring that taint propagation is sound and highly precise throughout the guest environment. A formal analysis of the taint propagation rules is provided to verify that most instructions introduce neither false positives nor false negatives. DECAF’s design also provides a plugin architecture with a simple-to-use, event-driven programming interface that makes it both flexible and extendable for a variety of analysis tasks.The implementation of DECAF consists of 9550 lines of C++ code and 10270 lines of C code. Its performance is evaluated using CPU2006 SPEC benchmarks, which show an average overhead of 605% for system wide tainting and 12% for VMI. Three platformneutral DECAF plugins - Instruction Tracer, Keylogger Detector, and API Tracer - are described and evaluated in this dissertation to demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of DECAF in writing cross-platform and system-wide analysis tools.This dissertation also presents the Virtual Device Fuzzer (VDF), a scalable fuzz testing framework for discovering bugs within the virtual devices implemented as part of QEMU. Such bugs could be used by malicious software executing within a guest under analysis by DECAF, so the discovery, reproduction, and diagnosis of such bugs helps to protect DECAF against attack while improving QEMU and any analysis platforms built upon QEMU. VDF uses selective instrumentation to perform targeted fuzz testing, which explores only the branches of execution belonging to virtual devices under analysis. By leveraging record and replay of memory-mapped I/O activity, VDF quickly cycles virtual devices through an arbitrarily large number of states without requiring a guest OS to be booted or present. Once a test case is discovered that triggers a bug, VDF reduces the test case to the minimum number of reads/writes required to trigger the bug and generates source code suitable for reproducing the bug during debugging and analysis.VDF is evaluated by fuzz testing eighteen QEMU virtual devices, generating 1014 crash or hang test cases that reveal bugs in six of the tested devices. Over 80% of the crashes and hangs were discovered within the first day of testing. VDF covered an average of 62.32% of virtual device branches during testing, and the average test case was minimized to a reproduction test case only 18.57% of its original size."

It has a special core that consists of self similar structure. Such a structure is obtained by following the formula for generating iterated function systems (IFS) in Fractal Theory. The resulted SSF can be viewed as a true fractal object in optical fibers. In addition, the method of fabricating SSF makes it possible to generate desired structures exponentially in numbers, whereas it also allows lower scale units in the structure to be reduced in size exponentially. The invention of SSF is expected to greatly ease the production of optical fiber when a large number of small hollow structures are needed in the core of the optical fiber.This dissertation will analyze the core structure of SSF based on fractal theory. Possible properties from the structural characteristics and the corresponding applications are explained. Four SSF samples were obtained through actual fabrication in a laboratory environment. Different from traditional conductive heating fabrication system, I used an in-house designed furnace that incorporated a radiation heating method, and was equipped with automated temperature control system. The obtained samples were examined through spectrum tests. Results from the tests showed that SSF does have the optical property of delivering light in a certain wavelength range.However, SSF as a new type of optical fiber requires a systematic research to find out the theory that explains its structure and the associated optical properties. The fabrication and quality of SSF also needs to be improved for product deployment. As a start of this extensive research, this dissertation work opens the door to a very promising new area in optical fiber research."

It has been receiving gradual attention due to its wide distribution throughout human body as well as its close relationship with human wellness. As the essential component of TJ, claudin family of transmembrane proteins plays a critical role in both architecture and flux control of TJ. The dysfunction of claudin leads to partial or complete loss of tight junction function, which eventually causes abnormalities and diseases throughout the body including skin, liver, kidney, lungs, and brain. Understanding self-assembly of claudin family proteins provides clues to better interpret TJ-related diseases and to find cure for them.In this thesis, monomeric architectures of claudin-3, -4, and -19 were developed using in silico homology modeling. The physical movements of these membrane proteins were simulated for long timescales, and their interactions were studied. Four unique dimeric structures, dimer A, B, C, and D, were quantified in the dimer distribution study. Results show that dimer A is the most predominated over other three configurations. Orientation analysis has further identified a subtype of dimer A, named dimer A*, with its configuration visualized and integrated in this thesis. The mutual mutation of claudin-3 with claudin-5 has identified that the ILE142 in claudin-5 is the key residue to maintain dimer B configuration. Supporting theory is that in claudin-5, hydrophobic tail of ILE142 (141 in claudin-3) firmly interacts with hydrophobic core of intramolecular ARG145 (144 in claudin-3), which restricts the free movement of ILE142 tail and thus form less dimer C. Additional dimer type, named dimer X, was also identified. Moreover, thermodynamic stability of dimer A were investigated by calculating PMFs and compared among seven members of claudin family. Binding energy of dimer A shows that claudin-5 > claudin-1/3 > claudin-4 > claudin-2 > claudin-15/19. The results generally indicate that barrier-forming claudins have firmer dimer A than pore-forming claudins."

Traditionally, the self-expansion model has focused on relationships as a major way to achieve self-expansion, although researchers have also pointed out the possibility that other non-relational activities, such as work and travel, could similarly lead to self-expansion. Study 1 examined whether an important individual difference, i.e. attachment styles, moderated people&;#8217;s preferences for relational or non-relational route to self-expansion. One major finding was that avoidance was negatively associated with people’s residual preference for relational over non-relational expansion, a phenomenon that was mediated by the desire for relationships. Given the universality of relationships, Studies 2 and 3 focused on how individuals with different attachment styles achieved self-expansion within a relationship context as function of the role one’s relationship partner may have played. In Study 2, it was found that for individuals high in avoidance, thinking of the partner as facilitative towards one’s personal goals, rather than relationship goals, led to an increased sense of self-expansion through the relationship, although the type of goal the partner facilitated did not influence the perceived self-expansion of individuals high in anxiety. Study 3 revealed that thinking of the partner as facilitative or non-facilitative towards personal goals did not impact perceived self-expansion through the relationship for individuals high in avoidance or anxiety. This research project makes important theoretical contributions by directly integrating traditional segregated literatures of self-expansion, attachment styles, and goal pursuit. It provides implications for the dynamic ways in which people satisfy the fundamental self-expansion motivation."

The majority of the literature on the self-initiated creativity of children examines the work of primary grade students in an art room setting, revealing a gap in the literature and the need for a study regarding self-initiated creative processes and products made by children in an intermediate general classroom setting. The research site was a democratically based, child-centered classroom in a private day school where students were encouraged to share in the development of the conceptual, curricular, and physical aspects of the learning environment. The self-initiated creative activities of the children provided a unique lens through which the researcher was able to view and understand his students’ learning styles, gain insight into their metacognitive processes, and observe the ways they navigated their classroom space. Empowering students to become critical agents through choice and autonomy led to arts-based approaches of inquiry and spontaneous creative learning experiences. An analysis of the data contributed to an understanding of six essential principles for facilitating self-initiated creativity within the everyday constraints of a traditional schooling environment, as well as cautionary revelations about how I could have been more effective at co-constructing an enduring culture that supported self-initiated creative learning in collaboration with my colleagues at the research site."
etd_92,Selfless Service: An Examination of Motivation in Public Sector Information Technology Service Transformation,Information Management and Technology,"IT Service Transformation, Motivation, Public Sector IT Services","This study explores the relationship between middle manager motivation and information technology (IT) service transformation in the public sector.  The pace of IT service transformation in the public sector, and specifically the U.S. Army, is slow compared to the lightning-fast pace of warfighting operations or the incredible rate of change in information technology.Middle management plays a key role in organizational change (Mintzberg, 1979).  Executives in the private sector often use extrinsic rewards to motivate employees to facilitate transformational change.  However, extrinsic rewards are severely restricted in the public sector.  Although public sector employees are motivated differently than private sector employees, it is likely that motivational determinants still influence their performance (Crewson, 1997).Leveraging Expectancy Theory (Vroom, 1964), this case study explores the influence of intrinsic and intangible motivational determinants on the performance of middle managers in a public sector IT service transformation initiative.  The study was conducted in the context of the U.S. Army's Enterprise Email initiative and was designed to answer the research question: To what extent are IT service managers motivated to facilitate the implementation of the enterprise email solution in the U.S. Army?  Data was collected from a variety of sources that included an online survey of mid-level IT service managers, project documents and reports, customer surveys, orders, and strategic communications.The findings suggest that organizational culture has a stronger influence than other extrinsic and intrinsic motivational determinants on the performance of military mid-level IT service managers during a service transformation."
etd_563,SENSOR MANAGEMENT FOR LOCALIZATION AND TRACKING IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Localization, Sensor management, Tracking, Wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are very useful in many application areas including battlefield surveillance, environment monitoring and target tracking, industrial processes and health monitoring and control. The classical WSNs are composed of large number of densely deployed sensors, where sensors are battery-powered devices with limited signal processing capabilities. In the crowdsourcing based WSNs, users who carry devices with built-in sensors are recruited as sensors. In both WSNs, the sensors send their observations regarding the target to a central node called the fusion center for final inference. With limited resources, such as limited communication bandwidth among the WSNs and limited sensor battery power, it is important to investigate algorithms which consider the trade-off between system performance and energy cost in the WSNs. The goal of this thesis is to study the sensor management problems in resource limited WSNs while performing target localization or tracking tasks.Most research on sensor management problems in classical WSNs assumes that the number of sensors to be selected is given a priori, which is often not true in practice. Moreover, sensor network design usually involves consideration of multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximization of the lifetime of the network or the inference performance, while minimizing the cost of resources such as energy, communication or deployment costs. Thus, in this thesis, we formulate the sensor management problem in a classical resource limited WSN as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), whose goal is to find a set of sensor selection strategies which re- veal the trade-off between the target tracking performance and the number of selected sensors to perform the task. In this part of the thesis, we propose a novel mutual information upper bound (MIUB) based sensor selection scheme, which has low computational complexity, same as the Fisher information (FI) based sensor selection scheme, and gives estimation performance similar to the mutual information (MI) based sensor selection scheme. Without knowing the number of sensors to be selected a priori, the MOP gives a set of sensor selection strategies that reveal different trade-offs between two conflicting objectives: minimization of the number of selected sensors and minimization of the gap between the performance metric (MIUB and FI) when all the sensors transmit measurements and when only the selected sensors transmit their measurements based on the sensor selection strategy.Crowdsourcing has been applied to sensing applications recently where users carrying devices with built-in sensors are allowed or even encouraged to contribute toward the inference tasks. Crowdsourcing based WSNs provide cost effectiveness since a dedicated sensing infrastructure is no longer needed for different inference tasks, also, such architectures allow ubiquitous coverage. Most sensing applications and systems assume voluntary participation of users. However, users consume their resources while participating in a sensing task, and they may also have concerns regarding their privacy. At the same time, the limitation on communication bandwidth requires proper management of the participating users. Thus, there is a need to design optimal mechanisms which perform selection of the sensors in an efficient manner as well as providing appropriate incentives to the users to motivate their participation. In this thesis, optimal mechanisms are designed for sensor management problems in crowdsourcing based WSNs where the fusion center (FC) con- ducts auctions by soliciting bids from the selfish sensors, which reflect how much they value their energy cost. Furthermore, the rationality and truthfulness of the sensors are guaranteed in our model. Moreover, different considerations are included in the mechanism design approaches: 1) the sensors send analog bids to the FC, 2) the sensors are only allowed to send quantized bids to the FC because of communication limitations or some privacy issues, 3) the state of charge (SOC) of the sensors affects the energy consumption of the sensors in the mechanism, and, 4) the FC and the sensors communicate in a two-sided market."
mae_etd_73,Shape Memory Assisted Self Healing (Smash) Polymeric and Composite Systems,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"polymer coatings, polymer films, RPSM, self healing, shape memory, SMASH","My research aims to develop a novel approach that uses the shape memory (SM) effect to aid self healing (SH) polymeric systems that are able to simultaneously close and re-bond cracks with a single thermal stimulus. This new concept is termed shape memory assisted self healing (SMASH). Additionally, a new type of shape memory termed reversible plasticity shape memory (RPSM) was also developed where both the elastic and plastic deformation found after deformation completely recover upon a thermal stimulation. I aim to utilize a broad range of polymeric and composite systems that include a single phase semi-crystalline system, a single phase amorphous blend, and a combination of these two polymers in a composite elastomer system to prove the versatility of the SMASH and RPSM effects. Chapter 1 gives a polymer science background along with SM and SH material overview. Chapter 2 discusses the fabrication and analysis of miscible blends that show the SMASH and RPSM effect using a semi-crystalline polymer, poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) to construct a SM PCL network (n-PCL) and PCL thermoplastic used as the SH agent (l-PCL). The PCL thermoplastic SH agent interpenetrated the n-PCL for form a single phase semi interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN). Films were made for testing to prove the SM and SH effects by varying the amount of SM network and SH agent to optimize both effects. Thermo-mechanical, tensile, and SH experiments were conducted to study the fixing, recovery and healing properties of the polymeric system. Chapter 3 focuses on a unique system for the fabrication of clear thin SMASH SIPN coatings that were developed for optical industrial applications. Here, an amorphous polymer composition, poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (poly(tBA)), was used in a blend of two forms, a network form for shape memory (n-tBA) and a linear form for self-healing (l-tBA), that, together, form a single phase SIPN. Thermal, thermo-mechanical, SM and SH scratch experiments were conducted to investigate both SM and SH mechanisms as influenced by the relative concentrations of n-tBA and l-tBA in the SIPN materials. Chapter 4 introduces for the first time an innovative smart polymeric soft material where aligned nanofibers are used to construct anisotropy embedded in an elastomeric matrix. This system, termed ""Anisotropic Shape Memory Elastomeric Composite"" (A-SMEC) was investigated for RPSM and SMASH properties. In addition, the anisotropic mechanical and shape memory properties were investigated and interpreted in light of the underlying structure. Chapter 5 builds upon the results of Chapter 4, presenting the fabrication and testing of laminated A-SMEC biomorphs that were designed to exploit anisotropic in RPSM behavior to yield predictably curled and twisted structures upon deformation. More specifically, the out-of-plane curvature and pitch were analyzed as a function of biomorph orientational lay-up. All polymeric systems described in this dissertation are examples of smart polymers that can be used to tailor mechanical performance while introducing new phenomena, such as self-healing, RPSM, and stretch-induced twisting. Chapter 6 discusses the conclusions followed by future work that are sub-sectioned for each chapter of the dissertation."
etd_409,Shape Memory Electrospun Scaffolds for Cell Mechanobiology and Bone Regenerative Applications,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Bone regeneration, Cell mechanobiology, Shape memory polymers, Thermoresponsive","Tissue engineering scaffolds have traditionally been static physical structures poorly suited to mimick the complex dynamic behavior of in vivo microenvironments. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) may address this limitation. Recent work has achieved two-dimensional cytocompatible SMP substrates, of which the surface topography can be triggered to control cell behaviors. To enable further advances in “smart” functional tissue engineering scaffolds, the goal of this dissertation was to develop a programmable cytocompatible SMP scaffold and further investigate potential applications of the SMP scaffolds.To achieve this goal, in Chapter 2, synthesis and characterization of a family of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS)-containing, polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) was investigated, and the effect of caprolactone content and water plasticization on the glass transition temperature of the TPUs was explored. In Chapter 3, a programmable SMP scaffold capable of changing shape and internal architecture under cytocompatible conditions was developed using electrospinning. Cell morphology—cytoskeletal and nuclear alignment—was found to be directed by shape-memory-actuated changes in scaffold shape and internal architecture. Furthermore, cells remained viable and attached before and after scaffold architectural change.The objective of Chapters 4 to 6 was to explore potential applications of programmable cytocompatible SMP scaffolds in bone regenerative medicine. In Chapter 4, the biomechanical feasibility of self-deploying shape memory polymer fixation—smart sleeve—was evaluated. The in vitro mechanical stabilization of the smart sleeve was compared to intramedullary (IM) nail using a mouse femoral transverse fracture model. The torsional mechanical stability provide by the smart sleeve was comparable to the IM nail; but the bending stability of the smart sleeve was significantly lower than the IM nail. In Chapter 5, the biological functionality of the smart sleeve employed as a supplementary stabilization device was investigated in an in vivo mouse critical-size defect model. Intraoperative deployment of the smart sleeve could be triggered by 45 °C saline irrigation. We found that the presence of the smart sleeve did not interfere with the bone healing process between the allograft and the native bone when compared to the allograft alone group. Finally, in Chapter 6, the deployable effect of the SMP scaffolds on the osteogenic differentiation capacity of human adipose-derived stem cells was evaluated. Successful osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated by the assessments of mineral deposition, alkaline phosphatase activity, and gene expression; no statistical difference was found between the active scaffolds and the static scaffolds.In this dissertation, programmable cytocompatible electrospun SMP scaffolds are developed and further employed to demonstrate their potential applications in cell mechanobiology and bone regeneration. In Chapter 7, conclusions and future directions are discussed and suggested for each chapter of this dissertation."
etd_378,Shape Memory Polymers as 2D Substrates and 3D Scaffolds for the Study of Cell Mechanobiology and Tissue Engineering,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Bone, Cell Culture, Cell Tracking, Mechanobiology, Shape Memory Polymer, Tissue Engineering","Tissue engineering is a promising, fast-growing field that combines cells, signals, and scaffolds to regenerate damaged tissues. To develop new, functional, engineered tissues, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how cell-material interactions affect the cell mechanobiological response. As a result, recent efforts have focused on developing complex synthetic materials that can mimic the dynamic in vivo cell environment. In this work, shape memory polymers (SMPs) were employed to develop dynamic 2D substrates and 3D scaffolds that undergo programmed changes in shape under cell compatible conditions. These substrates and scaffolds were applied in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate their potential as platforms to study cell mechanobiology and as functional tissue engineered constructs.The first part of this dissertation describes the fabrication and application of an SMP bilayer system capable of forming nano-scale wrinkles under cytocompatible conditions. Wrinkled substrates with easily tunable characteristics were employed to control the degree of cell alignment, with increased wrinkle amplitude and wrinkle orientation resulting in increased cell alignment until reaching a point of saturation. Active wrinkling with attached and viable cells was found to enable cell alignment to be “turned-on” on command. Additionally, cell migration on wrinkled substrates was assessed using quantitative, statistical-physics-based metrics which revealed cell motility atop anisotropic wrinkled substrates and which was more oriented and persistent than cell motility atop flat isotropic controlsThe second part of this dissertation describes the fabrication and application of porous 3D SMPs capable of expanding under physiological temperatures. A modified porogen-leaching approached was employed to fabricate highly porous, interconnected SMP scaffolds with tunable properties. The potential of SMP foams for use as synthetic bone substitutes was demonstrated in a mouse segmental defect model, where expanding foams were deployed intraoperatively to fill and conform to a critical size defect. Stiff SMP foams were able to maintain defect stability in a load-bearing application and integrated with the native bone after 12 weeks. Furthermore, deployable SMP foams showed potential for use as deployable cell-based therapies to facilitate bone repair, as expanding foams were able to support osteogenic differentiation of attached stem cells.This work demonstrates the potential of SMPs to be employed as dynamic materials to study cell-material interactions in dynamic environments and to aid in the development of functional tissue engineered constructs."
etd_637,"Shells, Sheets, and Shapes",Physics,,"Topology and geometry provide a unique perspective to study many systems. In this thesis we discuss three distinct soft condensed matter systems: (i) elastic shells, including topological defects on an elastic shell and how the symmetry of defect structures affects a shell’s ability to sustain external pressure; (ii) droplet sheets, including how defects and curvature drive a square-to-triangular lattice transition in a droplet network; (iii) atomically-thin membranes, including the effective bending rigidity of a fluctuating ribbon and a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon of a vibrating flap. In (i), as perfect crystalline order is incompatible with spherical topology, defects need to be introduced for any triangulation of a 2-sphere. We study how the stability of spherical crystalline shells under external pressure is influenced by the defect structure. In particular, we compare stability for shells with a minimal set of twelve +1 disclinations to shells with extended defect arrays (grain boundary “scars” with non-vanishing net disclination charge). We find that the critical pressure at which shells collapse is lowered for scarred configurations that break icosahedral symmetry and raised for scars that preserve icosahedral symmetry. The particular shapes which arise from breaking of an initial icosahedrally-symmetric shell depend on the F ?oppl-von K ?arm ?an number. In (ii), motivated by a recent experiment that prints tens of thousands of micron-sized aqueous droplets that bind by forming single lipid bilayers to form a cohesive network in bulk oil, we propose that this system is a model system to study lattice transitions that take place, for example, in colloidal crystals. In particular, we study the square-to-triangular lattice transition in 2D networks, where the transition is driven either by the explicit insertion of defects or by curving an initially flat lattice. In (iii), we use molecular dynamics to study the vibration of a thermally fluctuating 2D elastic ribbon clamped at both ends. We identify the eigenmodes from peaks in the frequency domain and track the dependence of the eigen-frequency of a given mode on the bending rigidity of the ribbon. With thermal contraction being taken care of, we define an effective bending rigidity using eigen-frequency and discuss the applicability of previous renormalization bending rigidity theory to the effective bending rigidity. Experimental realizations include two-dimensional atomically thin membranes such as graphene (see a recent experiment) and molybdenum disulfide or polymerized membranes. In the simulation of a flap, we find a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon where the flap vibrates about a tilt plane in the upper or lower space.This thesis contains some unpublished results. Some problems need further exploration."

The legislative intent of the provision was to encourage capital investment by firms, although prior research suggests that capital expenditures did not increase during the availability of 30% or 50% bonus depreciation. I find that the availability of 100% bonus depreciation significantly increases the likelihood that firms increase capital expenditures, as well as increases the magnitude of capital expenditures. Overall, my evidence highlights how temporary changes in capital asset expensing provisions affect firms’ behavior with respect to investment decisions and that the market reacts both positively and negatively to those decisions."
etd_19,Silence Is Golden: Older Women's Voices and The Analysis Of Meaning Among Survivor's Of Domestic Violence,Social Sciences,"domestic violence, older women","Current estimates indicate that upwards of 3,000,000 women a year are physically abused by an intimate partner, however, it is important to note that serious limitations associated with these estimates exist. Despite media campaigns, educational efforts, community outreach, and legislation, the majority of intimate partner violence that occurs in the United States continues to go unreported. While there is a vast literature on domestic violence, the focus has been on the experiences and outcomes of younger women. Very few studies have investigated the experiences of older women as survivors of domestic violence who came of age in an era of traditional gender values when men had authority and dominion over women, and there was no public acknowledgement of domestic violence. Little is known about the meaning older women make of their experiences with and beyond domestic violence, or the lifetime effect domestic violence has on women as they age.The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the ways in which older women make meaning of their experiences with domestic violence. The intent was to center on and illuminate the lives of older women survivors of domestic violence- the ways that they have come to understand and work through the complicated emotions and relationships in the wake of the abuse, and how they have constructed their identities around the experience. Additionally, I wanted to expose the institutional structures, forces, and ""wordless authorities"" that worked to subordinate these women and keep them silent.Life history interviews of 15 older women survivors, aged 60 to 89, were collected and analyzed. Four of the women were Native American and eleven of the women were white. Findings highlight the link between family of origin and individual development, and the influence that the family of origin has on later life values and actions. Several major themes emerged from the interviews related to the development of self-esteem, the loss of innocence, timing & decision making, divorce stigma, support, intimacy, remorse, and resilience. Race and age-related differences indicated that the younger women were less effected by traditional family values and divorce stigma; women who left their abusers very early in the relationship generally had better physical, psychological, and social outcomes, as did their children; and Native women were quicker to act on the decision to leave, were more focused and successful at restoring balance to their lives, were more forgiving of their partner's, and dwelled less on feelings of remorse or regret. All of the women spoke of the gender restrictions they faced, usually reflecting on `a different time' to account for their subordination, but they didn't question their scripted roles or responsibilities as women, wives, and mothers. Some of the older women, despite their personal histories of violence and abuse at the hand of their husbands, continue to feel that men should have authority over women in marriage."

In both World War I and World War II, women in uniform formed the vanguard for the expansion of women's role as American citizens. In the first half of the 20th century the contours of that expansion were military. Women seeking to expand the boundaries of their roles in American life--whether fighting against or allying themselves with existing structures--garbed themselves in military dress to do so. They presented themselves as uniformed citizens in their own military or volunteer service, as well as their official correspondence and newsletters. Organizations saw the uniform as an integral component of membership, even when made up of civilian volunteers, and presented themselves as such in materials intended for the public.  Popular media used references to uniforms as means of both praising and criticizing the military service of women, and the women's military services used their uniforms to respond. This dissertation argues that military and military-style uniforms provided a means to press for and a vocabulary to discuss women's martial citizenship in America during the World Wars. Uniforms were an integral part of the expansion of women's public roles in wartime."

Specifically, I examine the relationship between earnings manipulations and the use of small audit firms. I find that small audit firms are less able to constrain managers' opportunistic use of discretionary accruals. However I find no evidence that small audit firms are associated with real activities manipulation. By investigating a specific group of audit firms that are the smallest in the audit market, this study extends our understanding of the role of audit firm size in audit quality."
etd_523,"Social Beliefs, Agonistic Goals, Anger, and Biased Perceptions of Outgroups: A Social Action Theory of Covert Racial Prejudice",Psychology,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motives, Perception, Racial Discrimination, Social Action Theory","Racial prejudice and discrimination are an important societal and public health problem.  Approaches to understanding the origins of prejudice and discrimination have focused on attitudes, both overt (explicit) and covert (implicit).  But attitudes correlate only modestly with implicit biases and explicit discriminatory behavior.  Drawing on Social Action Theory, this study tested the hypothesis that the relationship between racial attitudes and implicit biases / overt discrimination is moderated by socially-induced personal regulatory struggles that take the form of agonistic striving, or persistently seeking to influence or control other people.  The research tested the hypotheses that agonistic striving fosters implicit racial biases and discrimination by (a) inducing states of hyper-alert vigilance to social threats; and (b) fostering reactive anger when personal strivings are threatened.  These reactions magnify the connection between disparaging social beliefs about subordinate groups and the perception that individuals from this group are dangerous.  Participants were 150 college students (mean age = 18.8 +1.4 years); 57% female; Caucasian) enrolled in an introductory psychology course.  Social beliefs were assessed with the Modern Racism Scale and the Social Dominance Orientation scale; agonistic strivings with the Social Competence Interview; covert racial biases with the Race Implicit Association Test; and explicit racial discrimination behavior with a job qualifications rating task. The social action theory taxonomy of regulatory strivings was replicated in this sample. Tests of study hypothesis indicated that implicit racial biases were associated with social dominance beliefs but not with modern racism, agonistic vigilance, or reactive anger. Overt racial discrimination was associated with agonistic reactive anger but not with agonistic vigilance or social beliefs.  Findings suggest ways to improve research on racial discrimination, and point to social-structural and psycho-educational interventions to curb discrimination and enhance public health."
psy_etd_168,Social Comparison Theory in the Context of Chronic Illness: Predictors and Consequences of Target Selection among Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes,Psychology,"Chronic Illness, Diabetes, Health Behavior, Motivation, Self-Care, Social Comparison","Individuals often compare themselves to others (i.e., social comparisons) in order to determine their status in a given domain. Social comparisons may be particularly important for patients with chronic illness; patients often experience uncertainty and anxiety about their health, which increase the likelihood and utility of social comparisons. Among patients, social comparisons can have both positive and negative health-related consequences (for affect, motivation to improve one's health care behaviors, etc.), depending upon several contextual features. Various steps in the social comparison process have been proposed, but not tested directly. The present study is an examination of the social comparison process among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) - a condition that is a growing public health concern for which psychosocial interventions can be beneficial. Patient participants used a web-mediated program to self-report individual difference characteristics prior to selecting from four comparison targets (descriptions of other patients with T2DM). Patients then rated their motivations for selection, read a description of their chosen patient, and reported on their response (e.g., current affect, motivation to improve self-care). Patients who endorsed greater symptom severity were more likely to choose sicker comparison targets, but choice was unrelated to personality characteristics. A model that incorporated several individual difference factors thought to be related to social comparison had moderate predictive value for comparison choice. The extent to which patients focused on differences and similarities between themselves and their chosen targets moderated affective and motivational response (respectively). These findings may contribute to the improvement of psychosocial interventions for patients with T2DM and other illnesses (e.g., components of cognitive intervention, educational materials that include patient testimonials, the composition of support groups)."
etd_211,Social Equality: On The Aim Of Distributive Justice,Philosophy,"egalitarianism, Rawls","One of the main debates in left political philosophy is that between social and luck egalitarians. Social egalitarians maintain that the aim of distributive of justice is to bring about socially equal relationships. By contrast, luck egalitarianism holds that the point of justice is ensure that distributive shares are unaffected by brute luck. In my dissertation, I defend social egalitarianism against luck egalitarianism through a series of essays on applied topics.In Chapter One, I discuss Rawls's principle fair equality of opportunity (FEO), which states that the equally talented and motivated ought to have equal prospects of securing jobs and other positions of social advantage. Rawls gives this principle lexical priority over the difference principle (the principle that economic inequalities are just only when they work to maximally benefit the least advantaged), where this priority means that it is wrong to sacrifice FEO to realize more fully the aims of the difference principle. Many prominent luck egalitarians reject Rawls's contention that FEO is lexically prior. I show why they are mistaken.In my second chapter, I discuss when FEO ought to obtain. Most philosophers think that FEO should obtain only once in peoples' lives - at the onset of adulthood - but I argue that we should reject one-off FEO. I show how the one-off view appears attractive only if we assume that luck egalitarianism is true. I maintain that once we embrace social egalitarianism, then we should endorse a different temporal conception of FEO. I argue that FEO should ultimately obtain intermittently throughout adults' lives.In Chapter Three, I investigate where a concern for responsibility might fit into social egalitarian theories like Rawls's. I argue that we should amend the difference principle in the following way: those whose position the difference principle aims to maximally improve (the ""least advantaged"") should include only those persons that lack a range of other viable occupational options in higher economic tiers. In other words, the talented and skilled who occupy the lowest economic strata despite having better options available should be taxed at a higher rate than everyone else in the bottom income bracket. Talented and skilled people should expect as a matter of justice to contribute to production in such a way that efficiently makes use of their skills. By amending the difference principle in this way, I offer a unique approach to the concern for responsibility, which is distinct from what animates luck egalitarian criticisms of Rawlsian principles.Finally, in Chapter Four, I investigate how, if at all, FEO should constrain parents' partial behavior toward their children. I argue that the most influential view about this - Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift's, which is motivated by luck egalitarianism - is implausibly restrictive. Nevertheless, Brighouse and Swift are right to contend that parents' behavior should be constrained to some extent. I then propose an alternative social egalitarian account that aims to avoid the negative implications of Brighouse and Swift's view."

I will examine my findings by answering the following questions to prove or deny that social media has enhanced the U.S. Military’s communication with its target audience. The first question is-Why did the U.S. Military change its strategy on using social media to manage communication? I am aiming to find out who or what events influenced this change and how long it took to make these changes. I hope to outline key lessons learned and the benefit of becoming pro-social media.The second question-What are the current procedures, practices and issues with the U.S. Military’s plan for managing social media? I aim to find out if the U.S. Military is effective with its current ability to manage themes and messages by use of social media.Third question is-Learning from a decade of communication through social media, what is the future of the U.S. Military’s social media plan? What have public affairs officers learned from past and current operations to help pave a new path for effective communication in an ever changing social media driven society.During the research process for this study, 20 public affairs officers (PAO) randomly selected from the five branches of U.S. Military service were interviewed to gain insight on the effectiveness of its communication. While this is only a small number and not a representation of the whole U.S. Military, it provided sufficient information to prove the desired hypothesis.While interviewed these 20 PAOs all three research questions were answered regarding the U.S. Military’s effectiveness while communicating, concerns with the current nature of communication and recommendations for the future to make communication even more effective."
etd_722,Social Security under Decentralized Authoritarianism: Politics of The Public Pension Program in China,Political Science,"Center-local relations, China, Old-age pension, Subnational variations","Welfare provisions are commonly regarded as an intrinsic product of democracy. Why do authoritarian rulers provide welfare programs to the people? How do authoritarian rulers promote welfare development under decentralized authoritarianism? This dissertation investigates these theoretical puzzles through a detailed study of the urban pension program for enterprise employees in authoritarian China. The decentralized fiscal and administrative structure in China makes the operation of the pension program a particularly challenging one. What are the redistributive incentives of the Chinese rulers? How does the central government differ from local governments in their redistributive calculation? How do these two levels of governments interact to ensure implementation of an expensive pension program? These are the questions this dissertation is set to address. This dissertation argues that while the Chinese central government more resembles long-sighted rulers and emphasizes welfare development, subnational governments are more short-sighted, being more motivated to promote short-term economic growth. The conflict of interests between these two actors leads to the classic principal-agent problem. This dissertation argues that the center uses fiscal subsidies as a leash to lead and restrain subnational governments, particularly those from regions with strategic importance to the center, to ensure proper implementation of the desired pension program. As the center’s fiscal subsidies reduce the costs of welfare programs, subnational governments with center fiscal support are more incentivized to promote welfare development. Therefore, the center’s subsidy program creates an uneven base of redistributive incentives for its subnational rulers. In addition to the availability of center fiscal support, this dissertation contends that the level of economic openness in a locality also shapes subnational governments’ redistributive incentives. Being afraid of capital flight, subnational governments in localities with a higher level of economic openness oftentimes discount welfare responsibility for investors with mobile assets. In localities where state-owned investments account for a larger share of the economy, the governments can impose higher taxes for welfare development. By combining these two factors – the availability of center fiscal support, and the level of economic openness – this study proposes five types of fiscal structure of the pension program at the subnational level.This dissertation’s contribution is threefold. First, it promises to enrich the existing literature on comparative welfare states, by filling the void in the redistributive incentives of authoritarian rulers. Second, instead of treating authoritarian rulers as a unitary actor, this study highlights the role of subnational governments in welfare politics, and details the center-local interplays in redistribution under the Chinese decentralized political system. This dissertation finds that the center uses fiscal subsidy programs to regulate its subnational governments. In so doing, this study also sheds new light on center-local relations in Chinese politics. Third, instead of attributing the Chinese regime’s authoritarian resilience to formal institutions, this dissertation contends that welfare programs, like the urban pension program, are employed by Chinese rulers to pre-empt and resolve public oppositions and thus to increase the regime’s resilience."
it_etd_79,Social Technologies and Informal Knowledge Sharing within and across Organizations,Information Science and Technology,"Informal ties, Knowledge sharing, Social media, Social technologies, Sociotechnical","This doctoral dissertation is focused on both empirical and conceptual contributions relative to the roles social technologies play in informal knowledge sharing practices, both within and across organizations. Social technologies include (a) traditional social technologies (e.g., email, phone and instant messengers), (b) emerging social networking technologies commonly known as social media, such as blogs, wikis, major public social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and (c) enterprise social networking technologies controlled by a host organization ( e.g., SocialText). The rapid uptake of social technologies, combined with growing interest in their broader social implications, raises pertinent questions about uses for knowledge sharing in organizations. The work reported in this thesis is motivated by two broad phenomena: (1) the importance of informal knowledge-sharing in organizations and (2) the rapid rise in the variety and prevalence of social technologies.The empirical basis of this research is a field study focused on the uses of social technologies by knowledge workers, specifically those in consulting firms. Building from the theoretical lenses of sociomateriality, structuration, and technological frames, the findings from this work advances our understanding of: (1) the ways social technologies are used in combination as a suite of tools, (2) the ways in which organizational norms, policies, and arrangements shape the uses of social technologies for knowledge practices, and (3) the variations in uses of social technologies by different groups of knowledge workers.The theoretical contribution of this work is to conceptualize the suite of social technologies used to support and enable knowledge workers is a more useful approach than the single-technological-tool-in-isolation approach, which is the norm in studies of computing. A second contribution of this work is to situate social technologies-in-use through incorporating complementary theoretical concepts: technology-mediated knowledge practices, social structures of organizations, and workers' distinct interpretations of social technologies (technological frames). Practical implications arising from this study both inform the ways social technologies can be collectively integrated in work practices and inform the design and implementation of social technologies for accommodating different needs and preferences of knowledge workers. This research also generates insight into how organizations can craft policies that realistically regulate the use of social technologies, while empowering individual workers to optimize their knowledge sharing capacity by supporting informal engagement via social technologies."

Survey data were collected from 658 parent-child dyads of Chinese adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years from Jiande, Zhejiang province in mainland China. Using data from multiple informants, the direct and indirect roles of socio-cultural influences, parenting strategies, smoking-specific parenting behaviors, and smoking-related cognitions on adolescent smoking behaviors were examined. Results indicated that smoking-related cultural values, extended family members smoking, and parental psychological control had direct effects on Chinese adolescents smoking behaviors. Smoking-related cultural values, parent smoking, and health-related values had indirect effects on adolescent smoking behaviors through smoking-related cognitions. Psychological control, frequency of communication about smoking, disapproval of adolescent smoking, and home rules against smoking indirectly influenced adolescent smoking behaviors through smoking-related cognitions. A sub-analysis of 496 nonsmoking adolescents revealed similar pathways linking socio-cultural and parenting influences on adolescent intention to smoke. The findings from this study provide valuable information for the development of prevention and intervention programs targeting adolescent smoking."

Our approaches throughout this thesis aim at developing soft actuators with both simple and complex geometries that have the spatial control over actuation shapes, which makes them desirable for a broad range of applications.In this thesis, we employed a porous poly (caprolactone) (PCL) shape memory polymer foam infiltrated with PDMS elastomeric matrix to fabricate the actuators. Thermal/mechanical characterizations were used to demonstrate good thermal properties and thermomechanical behavior of materials and composites. Scanning electron microscopy was conducted to illustrate the morphology of the composite actuators and PCL foam. Thermomechanical experiments and self-actuation tests were performed to demonstrate the good reversible actuation of the composite actuators."

In the past, developers were aware of the target’s organization and could easily determine the effect of an instruction on performance. The advent of high-level languages abstracted most of the target features that were at the core of assembly programming. Soon, developers started relying on asymptotic notations to describe the limiting behavior of code. However, this notation only describes how code tends to respond when the problem size grows but gives no insight on its real performance. To get a real performance estimate, the code has to be run or profiled. Nonetheless, running the code might be costly when the problem size is extremely large in some application domains such as numerical analysis. We propose a technique to estimate source code performance around compile time, before most of the code has been run. Our technique relies on the knowledge accumulated from benchmarked codes that have similar characteristics to the code at hand. To achieve this, (1) we study the effects of memory accesses, dependences and operations on performance; (2) define a performance similarity metric; (3) perform static analysis on the code-of-interest to extract important regions; (4) match these regions against a knowledge base of benchmarked codes; and (5) instrument the code and capture just-enough concrete program behavior through dynamic analysis to allow querying the knowledge base for similar behavior. We developed the SoPE framework as a compiler plugin which performs the aforementioned analyses, and reports the performance estimate of the code-of-interest at the end of compilation. Our estimates follow the concretely-run program performances."

The marching-on-in-time solver suffers from late time instability, while the marching-on-in-degree technique can avoid this problem.This thesis introduces a new temporal basis function and a new Green's function form that improves the computation speed of the marching-on-in-degree technique. This method can be used for the perfect conductor and can also be applied to conductors with loss or dielectric.As a method of moment solver, this marching-on-in-degree technique must solve a dense matrix equation and it may be time consuming if the objects are very large. Therefore, parallelization and a hybrid method are also proposed to handle large objects.This thesis will cover all my improvements to the time domain marching-on-in-degree method."

I examine “the transplant archive,” a self-compiled assemblage of archival fragments representing the lives of three unrelated American southern transplants who lived in NYC and were in some way affected by the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Methodologically, I bend the boundary between archival and critical ethnographic research by placing myself – my own sensory experience and positionality – within the archive. I argue that collectively these texts create cultural memories of AIDS via a stylization of southernness, which illuminates the performative potential of “doing” southern culture as a way of discombobulating the predominant logics of futurity and resisting the effects of a heteronormative linear temporal order brought about by the larger United States public sphere. I infer that each of the figures I analyze illustrates a southern style that productively functions as a backward temporal regression, simultaneously a backwardness in time and a backwardness that culturally functions as a signifier of southernness. More specifically, I insist that through their southern performances, each featured transplant rhetorically constructs their own temporality against the ominous risk of HIV/AIDS."
geo_etd_76,"Spaces of Socio-Ecological Distress: Fossil Fuels, Solar Salt, and Fishing Communities in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela",Geography,"Fishing communities, Fossil fuels, Lake Maracaibo, Political ecology, Political economy, Salt","This dissertation examines how the livelihoods and health of fishers in the community of Ancon de Iturre have been affected by the industrial production of solar salt used mostly for the extraction and petrochemical transformations of fossil fuels in Lake Maracaibo. I argue that even though the productive infrastructure of resource extraction industries are spatially fixed in place, the social and environmental consequences resulting from the production of oil and natural gas happen not just in situ. Rather they are re-produced at different times and geographic scales away from the extraction sites as a result of the extensive spatial reach of fossil fuels.The project, grounded in political ecology and political economy of nature, endeavors to unravel the socio-ecological contradictions that emerge from the complex relations between nature and society in Ancón de Iturre. In order to uncover the complex interactions between the different actors involved in this study, I develop an approach that blends an evaluation of broader-scale material and institutional interconnections with an ethnographically oriented analysis of the day-to-day dynamics of fisher's struggle to consolidate their livelihoods. This approach utilized a mix of qualitative methods such as archival work, document analysis, semi-structured interviews, oral histories, and participant observation."
etd_202,Spatial Features of Labor Markets and Links to the Housing Market,Economics,,"This dissertation comprises three papers on spatial features of labor markets and links to the housing market. The first two papers look at how a local parental leave policy and the neighborhood in which one resides can influence women's decision to work. One paper shows that New Jersey's 2009 family leave insurance program induces women to remain employed following childbirth. The other reveals that, for women, having other women with similar aged children to yours among your closest neighbors makes you emulate their work behavior. The final paper analyzes how seasonality in occupational employment via either monthly or business-cycle induced fluctuations to labor demand increases the likelihood of holding a home equity line of credit. This finding is consistent with individuals drawing on these credit lines to access stored home equity in order to smooth consumption in the face of short-term breaks to employment."
etd_359,Specification of V2b and KA neurons in the zebrafish spinal cord.,Biology,"development, GABA, neurons, specification, spinal cord, zebrafish","Spinal cord contains different types of neurons. A vast majority of these neurons are interneurons. Therefore, a better understanding of how interneurons in the spinal cord develop is particularly important, as it will hopefully enable researchers to establish better treatments for spinal cord injury patients.  In this thesis, I used zebrafish to study development of two classes of spinal cord neurons - KA cells (which correspond to cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons, CSF-cNs) and V2b cells. Both KA and V2b neurons are functionally important in vertebrate locomotor circuitry.Development of functional neurons involves progression of genetic cascades that lead to correct cell specification. Some of the most important genes expressed during cell development encode for transcription factors, which are regulatory proteins that can either activate or repress expression of downstream genes.  Both V2b and KA neurons in zebrafish express a common set of transcription factors - Tal1, Gata2a, and Gata3. These proteins are not present in any other spinal cord cell type. Previous work used a knockdown approach (morpholinos) to show that gata2a and gata3 have different functions in specification of KA cell types - KA"" cells require gata2a and KA' cells require gata3 to develop correctly.  In this thesis, I test whether the same phenotypes occur in null mutants. Also, I investigate the role of tal1 in specification of KA cells, and the role of all three (gata2a, gata3, tal1) genes in V2b specification. To do this, I used tal1, gata2a and gata3 zebrafish mutants.KA and V2b neurons also share another characteristic - all these cells are GABAergic. Therefore, I investigate whether tal1, gata2a and gata3 genes are required for correct specification of V2b and/or KA global cell fate and/or GABAergic phenotypes of these cells. In addition, I identify a subset of genes expressed by either KA"", KA' and/or V2b cells and analyze the expression of some of these in these mutants.My results show that tal1, gata2a, and gata3 have distinct functions in each neuron type. In KA"" cells, gata2a is required for correct expression of the majority of KA"" markers and the GABAergic phenotype of these cells. Interestingly, both tal1 and gata3 are not required for correct specification of KA"" cells. In KA' cells, the situation seems to be reversed - tal1 and gata3 are required for correct expression of all KA' markers, but gata2a is required for only some aspects of the KA' cell fate in a subset of KA' cells. In V2b cells, the phenotypic effects of these mutations are more complicated - neither tal1, gata2a nor gata3 are required for correct expression of all V2b genes. However, tal1 is required for expression of a subset of these genes, and for the GABAergic phenotype of V2b cells.This thesis contributes to better understanding of KA"", KA' and V2b neuron specification.  Also, the presented results have broader implications, as they underlie the importance of cell type specificity of genetic cascades that lead to correct development of spinal cord neurons."
etd_742,Sporting Bodies: The Rhetorics of Professional Female Athletes,Writing Program,"Female Athletes, Gender, Performance, Race, Sexuality, Sports","In my dissertation, “Sporting Bodies: The Rhetorics of Female Athletes,” I interrogate how female athletes are represented in the media, trace the dominant cultural images and discourses associated with these representations, illustrate how female athletes use venues such as ESPN The Magazine as a vehicle to represent themselves even as they are represented by ESPN in ways that are not entirely within their control, and examine how female athletes’ self-presentation in the Body Issues can be interpreted as strategic, rhetorical acts. This project begins by investigating how historical discourses have influenced women’s athletics and female athletes.  Rhetorically examining historical discourses about female athletes and women’s bodies demonstrate how patterns of marginalization have developed and continue to function in contemporary sports and American culture. I then build out these discourses in our contemporary setting, specifically focusing on arguments made my feminist sports scholars and women’s sports advocates, which call for the media to solely focus on the athleticism of female athletes. I also I offer the critique that an important limitation of these arguments is the lack of discussion about the economic pressures that greatly influence professional athletes.Additionally, a main focus of this dissertation is my rhetorical analysis of the visual and textual representations of female athletes in ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issues. I argue that we should resist interpretations of the representations of female athletes that position their sexual, racial, and feminine appearances as something to be ignored and devalued or as something that should be the focus of attention in themselves. The central goal in this project is to demonstrate how female athletes engage in rhetorical acts, via the representations of their bodies, that are complicated and often contradictory. A rhetorical analysis of the female athletes in the Body Issues is especially provocative because it offers a way to look at the representations of these athletes’, to look at their multiple subjectivities, and consider how they use their bodily appearances, pose types, and interviews in order to maintain the structures of the sporting world, or to survive and/or to gain visibility, economic security, public recognition, and the power to speak. Ultimately, I argue that their collective rhetorical activity demonstrates how athletes use the Body Issues as a vehicle to work within and against the male-dominated sporting world and propel themselves, their sport, and the larger organization of women’s athletics into positions of power."

The focus of this dissertation research is to exploit the refractory nature of zircon and apatite to understand the formation and evolution of highly deformed rocks in the Minnesota River Valley and the provenance of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian sedimentary rocks deposited during the continental rifting of Laurentia.The Archean rocks of the Minnesota River Valley consist of ~3.50-3.10 Ga highly deformed orthogneisses, a ~2.6 Ga non-deformed granite and garnet-biotite paragneiss. Initial Hf isotopic values in zircon and whole-rock trace element data from the 3.5 Ga gneisses suggest that these rocks were not formed in a modern plate tectonic regime, consistent with other datasets that go back as far as ~4.4 Ga. Not until post 3.14 Ga are the data consistent with those that would be observed in rocks that formed by more modern day plate tectonic processes. This suggests that plate tectonics as it is observed today did not operate for the first 1.42 b.y. of Earth history.To further investigate whether modern-style plate tectonic processes operated in the early Earth, Sr isotopes were collected from single apatite crystals in a 3.5 Ga gneiss from the Minnesota River Valley where Hf isotopic data already exist. The high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio (average = 0.7049) of the apatite, compared to the bulk earth or depleted mantle suggest that the source had a long crustal residence time before melting, consistent with the Hf isotopic data in chapter 1 and also suggesting that modern-style plate tectonic processes were not responsible for the formation of 3.5 Ga crust in the Minnesota River Valley.Finally, U-Pb geochronologic data were collected from detrital zircon from Neoproterozoic-Cambrian sedimentary rocks along the rifted margin of eastern Laurentia from New York to Georgia. These data confirm the presence of a large-scale unconformity at the base of most Cambrian sequences and are consistent with detachment faulting as the mechanism for continental rifting beginning in the latest Neoproterozoic."
etd_549,Statistical Mechanical Treatments of the Optical Properties of Cadmium Selenide Quantum Dots,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Cadmium Selenide, ensembles, normal mode analysis, optical properties, Quantum dots, states","Semiconductors that exist in the nanoscale are referred to as Quantum Dots (QDs). This distinction is made because in the nanoscale, semiconductors behave much differently compared to their bulk counterparts. QDs possess band gaps that change based on their size and this unique property enables them to emit different colors, rendering them useful in a number of applications. QDs are widely used in LED technology and are becoming commonplace in biological applications involving in-vivo imaging. Efforts have gone into making QDs viable for photovoltaic applications as well. Although a lot is understood about the effects of size and shape on the optical properties of quantum dots, little is known about the extent to which these properties change when the geometry of a QD is perturbed very slightly. The objective of this research is to quantify the changes in the band gap when an ensemble of a QD structure is considered. These changes are of interest because any system at equilibrium over time will experience a multitude of slightly differing structural configurations brought on by their states. This research is split into two parts – this thesis describes the side of the research that focuses on generating a population of states required for study and the other aspect involves conducting rigorous quantum calculations on the states to establish the band gap. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were utilized to generate a population of states of CdSe QD clusters of various sizes at three different temperatures. Quantum calculations on these states showed that for an equilibrated 64 atom cluster at 300 K, the band gap exists mostly between 0.10 to 0.26 hartrees and exhibits a periodicity within this boundary."
etd_47,Steroid hormone regulation of fetal mouse oocyte development,Biology,,"The factors governing maintenance of the non-renewable reservoir of primordial follicles in female mammals remain largely elusive. During the early stages of fetal development, oocytes grow in nests or clusters known as germ cell cysts. Cysts break down into individual oocytes in the perinatal period and become enclosed by somatic pregranulosa cells to form primordial follicles. Steroid hormones have been shown by numerous studies to be one of the important factors which critically govern the process ofcyst breakdown and follicle formation. There has been earlier evidence from this laboratory to indicate that exogenous exposure of neonatal mice ovaries to estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) or E2 mimicking chemicals known as xenoestrogens such as Diethylstilbestrol (DES) and Bisphenol-A (BPA) delay cyst breakdown and follicle formation. The overall goal of this dissertation project is centered on the pivotal question: ""What is the source of steroid hormone signaling and its role in meiotic progressionduring fetal oocyte development in mice?"" One of the two objectives of this dissertation was to identify the sources of the steroid hormones (maternal circulation or fetal ovaries) which regulate fetal oogenesis. Our studies showed prominent expression of both mRNA and protein in the fetal ovaries for aromatase and 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3?HSD), cardinal steroidogenic enzymes required for E2 and P4 synthesis respectively.The mRNA levels for both aromatase and 3?HSD in the fetal ovaries detected by qPCR were found to decrease prior to cyst breakdown. These results align to our previous model that high levels of steroid hormones keep oocytes in cysts during fetal development and the drop in hormone levels is required to trigger cyst breakdown. Toanalyze the functional significance of this local steroid action, we used aromatase and 3?HSD inhibitors (letrozole and trilostane respectively) in organ culture to block hormone production by fetal ovaries. We find that the total number of oocytes was reduced in treated ovaries compared to controls. The second objective of the dissertation was to examine the relation between two temporal events in mice oogenesis: progression to the diplotene stage and primordial follicle formation. We performed a thoroughquantitative analysis by nuclear morphological observations of diplotene versus prediplotene nuclei of hematoxylin and eosin stained serial sections of ovaries at different ages. Interestingly, we observed that primordial follicle formation occurs irrespective ofthe meiotic stage of the oocyte nuclei. Thus oocytes in follicles were found both at diplotene and pre-diplotene stages. We also wanted to understand the role of steroid hormone signaling in meiotic progression of oocytes. Our data indicate that exogenoustreatment of P4 and not E2 decrease the number of follicles containing oocytes at diplotene. Such insights from the murine research models significantly contribute to our knowledge of the meiotic defects caused due to E2 or P4 exposure during fetal oogenesis in the case of human pregnancies (which often results from exposure to environmental estrogens or xenoestrogens). Aneuploidy is one of the prevalent causes for geneticdisorders in humans and it arises from anomalies in the chromosome content of the gametes (sperms and ova). Any disruption in the normal meiotic events during fetalgametogenesis may be amplified along the way to give rise to aneuploid gametes. Meiotic studies in model organisms are therefore indispensable to our understanding ofhuman aneuploidy. In summary, this dissertation project has focused on the critical role of steroid hormone regulation of fetal mouse oocyte development and its role on meiotic progression, thus contributing to our understanding of early ovarian differentiation."
etd_62,"STRATIGRAPHIC FRAMEWORK AND QUATERNARY PALEOLIMNOLOGY OF THE LAKE TURKANA RIFT, KENYA",Earth Sciences,"Africa, Lakes, Paleoclimate, Turkana","Lake sediments are some of the best archives of continental climate change, particularly in the tropics. This study is focused on three ~10m sediment cores and high-resolution seismic reflection data from Lake Turkana in northern Kenya. Lake Turkana is the world's largest desert lake and the largest lake in the Eastern Branch of the East African Rift System. It is situated at ~2 °N at 360 m elevation and is ~250 km long and ~30 km wide with a mean depth of 35 m. The lake surface receives less than 200 mm yr-1 of rainfall during the twice-annual passing of the Intertropical Convergence Zone via Indian Ocean-derived moisture, and evaporation is >2300 mm yr-1. This study is the first to quantify the climate and deepwater limnologic changes that have occurred in the area during the African Humid Period (AHP) and since the Last Glacial Maximum.A 20-kyr, multiproxy lake level history was derived from ~1100 km of CHIRP seismic reflection data, in conjunction with gamma ray bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon, total inorganic carbon, core lithology, and scanning XRF data from sediment cores that were chronologically constrained by radiocarbon dates. Two desiccation events occurred at 18.5 and 17 ka when the lake was at least 100 m lower than today, as evidenced by basin-wide, high-amplitude reflections correlated to sand intervals in the sediment cores. Lake level rose abruptly at ~11 ka as interpreted from an increase in organic carbon content and abrupt shift to silt and clay-sized sediment, after which Lake Turkana overflowed into the White Nile River System. AHP highstand conditions lasted until ~5 ka when the lake became a closed basin. The loss of Lake Turkana as a White Nile input likely had significant implications for nascent communities living along the Nile. Lake level has fluctuated but remained at a moderate lowstand since its mid-Holocene closure.An easterly shift of moisture derived from the Congo Basin has been proposed as an additional moisture source for environments in East Africa during the AHP, as evidenced by an expanding number of hydrogen isotope records from lake basins in East Africa. To determine if Atlantic-derived moisture reached Lake Turkana in the past via the Congo Basin, compound specific (C28 n-alkanoic acids) hydrogen isotopes (?Dwax) were measured from the composite sediment core record from Lake Turkana.The record revealed that ?Dwax values were depleted by more than -60 / during the AHP. ?Dwax depletion occurs abruptly at 13.7 ka and is sustained throughout the AHP, and values gradually become more enriched after 7 ka. This depletion suggests that Congo-derived moisture had a significant influence on Turkana precipitation during the AHP, but depletion of that magnitude cannot be explained solely by a change in moisture source. In addition to the source effect, a possible vegetation effect was quantified using stable carbon isotopes of leaf waxes, and the amount effect was estimated using modern Kenyan amount effect coupled with a published basin fill model. It was determined that vegetation can account for up to -17 /, and amount effect estimations range from -17 / to - 24 / of the total AHP depletion. After accounting for these effects, precipitation during the AHP is depleted relative to a 100% increase in precipitation amount, which we suggest is driven by an influx of moisture derived from the Congo Basin. Our calculations suggest that at least 45% of the moisture supplied during the AHP was Congo-derived.The precipitation-evaporation balance of a lake system is closely related to its heat budget. To quantify changes in temperature through the onset and termination of the AHP, the paleotemperature proxy called TEX86 was used to generate a 14-kyr record of lake surface temperatures for Lake Turkana. This proxy has successfully reconstructed regional and high-latitude paleotemperatures in other large African lakes.TEX86 temperatures from 14 to 0.4 ka are highly variable and range from 24.3 °C to 28.6 °C with a mean of 25.9 °C. There is a long-term trend within the temperature record that follows mean northern hemisphere peak summer insolation, and a mean temperature of 26.2 °C during the early Holocene decreases to 25.7 °C during the late Holocene. A century-scale fluctuation of ~1 °C persists throughout most of the record which appears to be related to lake mixing processes that overprint the regional climate signal based on fluctuations in metal ratios. While this reduced sensitivity of the TEX86 proxy was an unexpected result from this analysis, it has shown that this proxy may have limitations in its application to well-mixed, tropical, arid-land lake systems. Despite high-frequency variation, TEX86 temperatures remain close to the mean for the duration of the record, which is attributed to the evaporation response of this lake system."

A mixed-method approach was used to examine the relationships among these key constructs. Quantitative data included 150 married and 47 cohabitating African American mothers from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, with children in the home between ages 0-5 years. Women were between ages 18 and 45 and had been in their relationships between 1 and 19 years.Findings indicated that a lack of trust predicted lower romantic relationship satisfaction over and above cultural and demographic characteristics of the couple. Relationship strengths weakened the relationship between stress and romantic relationship satisfaction. Telephone interviews with 10 married African American women supported the quantitative findings and in addition revealed African American women's commitment to the ideals of romantic relationships, trust, communication and spirituality contributed to romantic relationship satisfaction. These findings indicate that although there are barriers to healthy relationship formation and development, African American women highly valued relationships and family life and employed culturally specific strengths to overcome challenges."

In particular, geologist are uncertain about specific details of magmatic and tectonic processes beneath these divergent plate boundaries and how these processes may vary along the spreading axis. Investigations that combine geologic relationships and magnetic properties continue to yield fundamental tools for understanding and constraining seafloor spreading processes. This thesis contains a collection of studies designed to characterize structural geology and magnetic properties of oceanic crust formed in regions with high magma supply. A brief overview is provided in an introduction to three separate chapters that are considered individual contributions. Chapter one presents paleomagnetic and structural data from sheeted dikes that are used in combination with regional geologic relationships to constrain the deformation and tectonic history of oceanic crust exposed at the tip of a propagating rift on the East Pacific Rise. Chapter two describes the magnetic fabrics of sheeted dikes from seafloor exposures that provide evidence for a wide range of magma flow directions beneath fast-spreading ridges with high and relatively continuous magma supply. Chapter three provides paleomagnetic evidence to support structural observations for significant rotations of crustal blocks within a migrating transform fault zone in North Iceland that may exhibit similar kinematics to other oceanic transforms."

Todate, the vast amount of theoretical/computational modeling efforts on flowmicrostructurecoupling has focused on continuum-level and stochastic descriptions.Such approaches, while useful in qualitatively predicting polymer dynamics and rheologyin model systems, are incapable of describing the effects of polymer-solvent, polymerpolymerand polymer-wall interactions. Further, in the context of polymer solutions, theincorporation of hydrodynamic interaction are often computationally challenging. Hence,the goal of this work has been to investigate the structure, dynamics and rheology ofsolutions of flexible linear polymers using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations inpresence of explicit solvent mediated interactions.Coarse-grained (CG) molecular models and corresponding force fields are employedto describe the polymer, solvent and the underlying physico-chemical interactions. TheCG models are validated against atomistic ones by comparing the predictions of certainstructure parameters such as persistence length, radius of gyration and radial distributionfunctions of the monomeric units. Results are first presented for the dynamics of a singlepolymer chain in shear flow. The effects of chain length and shear rate on theconfiguration statistics, e.g. tumbling frequency and orientation distribution of the end-toendvector, are presented and compared to experimental observations as well aspredictions of mesoscopic stochastic dynamic theories. Further, the effects of solventpolymerinteractions on the configuration dynamics of a single polymer chain undergood, theta and poor solvent conditions are discussed. Specifically, the role of solventquality is shown to have a pronounced effect on coil-stretch transition in shear flow. Wealso show that in addition to tumbling dynamics, polymer chain may undergoconfigurational changes through a novel mechanism, namely collapse dynamics. CGMDpredictions for the relationship between the zero-shear viscosity and polymerconcentration in dilute and semi-dilute regimes are presented and compared toexperiment results. Shear thinning behavior is observed in both dilute and semidilutesolutions in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Possible approaches toparameterizing phenomenological constitutive models using MD simulation data isexplored. Subsequently, influence of solvent quality on the rheological properties ofdilute and semidilute solutions is discussed.

Understanding flow-microstructure coupling in micellar systems can benefit applications ranging from targeted drug delivery and detergency to enhanced oil recovery and hydrofracking. Amongst micellar fluids, wormlike micelles (WLMs) are extremely interesting due to their structural similarity to polymers and their ability to constantly undergo scission and recombination at equilibrium. More recently, much has been generated in studying the effect of adding colloidal particles to WLMs. Colloidal particles can not only add functionality to the fluid but also act as viscosity modifiers. Such solutions can be used to design active nanomaterials for applications in energy harvesting and sensing. While several theories and continuum-level computational models have been developed to study the dynamics and rheology of WLMs, molecular-level explorations of the flow-structure coupling in such solutions is lacking. Further, in the case of mixtures of colloidal particles and WLMs, there are only a handful of attempts to develop theoretical/computational frameworks capable of describing their thermodynamics, self-assembly and phase behavior. The goals of this thesis are to uncover mechanisms by which WLMs interact with colloidal particles and to determine how these interactions affect the macroscopic properties of mixtures of model WLMs and colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.Coarse-grained (CG) molecular models and corresponding force-fields are employed to describe the NP, cationic cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surfactant, hydrotropic sodium salicylate (NaSal) salt, solvent and the underlying physico-chemical interactions. Results are first presented for the dynamics of a single self-assembled rodlike micellar aggregate under shear flow. The effect of shear rate on the configurational dynamics, e.g. orientation distribution of the end-to-end vector and tumbling frequency are presented and compared to experimental observations as well as predictions from stochastic simulations and mesoscopic theories. Further, a relationship between micelle length and stretching force is presented and compared with experimental estimates of similar forces in biological systems. Finally, a shear rate-independent energy barrier for micelle scission is identified for relatively large shear rates.We also show that the addition of NPs to surfactant solutions can result in the formation of NP-surfactant complexes (NPSCs). The effect of NP charge and surface chemistry on the nature of the self-assembly is discussed. Further, such NPSCs can further interact with WLMs, in the presence of NaSal salt, to form electrostatically stabilized micelle-NP junctions via an end cap attachment mechanism. The dynamics, energetics and stability of such junction formation is also described in detail. These junctions can give rise to unique rheological modifications of WLMs such as significant buildup in viscosity and viscoelasticity. Large-scale equilibrium and non-equilibrium MD simulations consisting of several NPs and WLMs are performed to study the flow-microstructure coupling in such systems. The relationship between the zero-shear viscosity, NP volume fraction and salt concentration at a fixed surfactant concentration is presented. Shear thinning behavior is observed for all of the systems studied. Shear thinning is accompanied by flow-alignment and shear-induced isotropic-to-nematic transitions in micellar systems. Further, the evolution of the first normal stress difference, N1, is presented as a function of time and shear rate, and compared with experimental observations for similar systems. The results of this work provides insight into the mechanisms of self-assembly in WLMs and colloidal NPs and demonstrate that rheological properties of WLMs can be uniquely controlled by the addition of NPs."
etd_27,"Structure, Rheology and Optical Properties of Plasmonic Fluids",Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Micelle, Nanoparticle, Plasmonic, Rheology, Surfactant","Fluids with tunable optical and rheological properties are of fundamental and practical interest. They can be easily processed to manufacture thin films and interfaces for applications such as molecular detection and light trapping in photovoltaics. Cationic surfactants such as cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide have the ability to self assemble with metallic nanoparticles to form a corona or a double-layer vesicular structure. These structures upon further interaction with wormlike micelle fragments are hypothesized to form micelle-nanoparticle elastic networks. In this dissertation, solution phase self-assembly is utilized to uniformly distribute various metallic nanoparticles to produce stable multicomponent plasmonic fluids with remarkable color uniformity. The optical properties of the fluids can be robustly tuned by varying the species, concentration, size and/or shape of the nanoparticles. Multicomponent plasmonic fluids capable of broadband absorption of visible light are produced via the self-assembly route. Small angle X-ray scattering and rheological studies suggest that the nanoparticles are incorporated into the wormlike micelle network to form a more compact double network.These fluids exhibit rich rheological behavior depending on the nanoparticle concentration and the salt to surfactant molar ratio. Specifically, non-monotonic dependence of zero shear viscosity on nanoparticle concentration, rheopexy, shear thickening, shear banding and shear thinning are observed. The fluids exhibit enhanced viscoelasticity upon the addition of more nanoparticles. The mechanical, rheological and optical properties of plasmonic fluids greatly depend upon the temperature due to the structural changes of the micellar solutions. The application of plasmonic fluids to efficient light trapping in photovoltaic cells, plasmon-enhanced microalgal growth and optofluidic devices have been designed and demonstrated in this dissertation."

Many researchers and practitioners are concerned about student persistence (course completion) and performance (completion of a course with a grade of C or better) in online courses. This study investigated the undergraduate student characteristics that predict student persistence and performance in online courses and the face-to-face equivalents at a four-year private northeastern university. The sample consists of undergraduate students (42,280 observations, 25,167 unduplicated student headcount, which is the actual number of individual students in the population) who enrolled in courses, regardless of delivery format, from fall 2002 to spring 2013. This study attempted to identify the undergraduate student characteristics that predict student persistence and performance in online courses and the face-to-face equivalents while controlling for all available institutional variables such as demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and financial aid) and academic performance (grade point average prior to enrollment at the institution, concurrent enrollment programs, and math and verbal scholastic aptitude test scores). The student characteristics were examined using multilevel modeling. The first level of analysis was the individual student and the second level of analysis was the academic school/college in which the student was enrolled. The findings of this study were mixed. No cause and effect claims were made. Aligning with much of the literature in this area, the results of this study consistently demonstrate that GPA prior to enrollment at the institution predicts student success in both online courses and the face-to-face equivalents. Students enrolled in the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the School of Management were more likely to succeed (persist and perform) in both online courses and the face-to-face equivalent. Consistently those students who identified their race/ethnicity as a minority, were less likely to succeed in online courses and the face-to-face equivalents."
etd_341,Students' Attitudes towards Socially--but Not Scientifically--Controversial Subjects: Evaluating Ways in which These Attitudes May Be Shifted,Science Teaching,"Biology, Evolution, Genetically Modified Organisms, Global Climate Change, Nature of Science, Primary Literature","Chapter1: Numerous anti-science bills introduced into state legislatures reference the ""strengths and weaknesses"" of scientific subjects, but the subjects they target, most commonly evolution and global climate change, are not topics of contention within the scientific community. This brief work provides a researched rebuttal to the notion that evolution and climate change have strengths and weaknesses of the form implied by anti-science legislation while providing examples of actual scientific disagreement about these subjects. The disagreement is not, of course, about whether or not evolution or climate change are factual occurrences, but rather over ideas such as the finer points of evolutionary mechanisms or providing physical evidence that support theoretical ideas produced by mathematical models.Chapter 2: The HungerU campaign of the Farm Journal Foundation includes a mobile, informal education exhibit centered on raising college students' awareness of hunger in the US and abroad, as well as the role of modern agriculture in solving hunger-related problems. This study evaluated changes in students' understandings of hunger as a cause of mortality before and after participating in the HungerU exhibit, as well as concurrent changes in their attitudes toward bioengineered or genetically modified foods. Students showed a significant increase in their understanding of hunger as the leading cause of mortality world-wide as well as a significant increase in their level of concern about hunger. Although there was no explicit instruction on GM foods, there were simultaneous significant increases in these students' opinions that farmers should be allowed to use bioengineered crops in food production and that GMOs are a good option for solving issues related to world hunger. We posit that becoming more aware of and concerned about issues related to hunger may have allowed students to become more open minded to technologies to which they were previously ideologically opposed.Chapter 3: Given the high availability of different media sources to students today, it stands to reason that some media sources would be of greater quality than others when communicating particular subjects to students. Previous findings have shown viewers of comedy news shows (the type of news show most frequently watched by younger viewers) to be better informed on some issues than viewers of other news outlets such as Fox News, CNN, or MSNBC. We sought to compare the effects of two different sets of videos, one comedic and one authoritative scientific, on students' knowledge of and attitudes towards climate change as well as how the two sets of videos were received by students. Surprisingly, we found no difference is effects on students' knowledge of or attitudes towards climate change. We did find however, that students generally felt that the authoritative videos were more likely to influence the way someone might vote, and that liberal students felt both videos were slightly more likely to influence voting than conservative students. We then make suggestions for future studies on media related to climate change, and for climate change educators.Chapter 4: This qualitative study explores the experiences of six students enrolled in a special topics biology class that exclusively used primary literature as course content material. NOS conceptions have been linked to students' attitudes toward scientific subjects, but there has not been research specifically exploring the effects of primary literature use on NOS conceptions. Results, based both upon written responses to an established and validated NOS survey (VNOS-C) taken at the beginning and end of the course and upon reflective essays in which students described in detail their experiences with using primary literature, indicate positive gains in various aspects of NOS conceptions as well as increased confidence with approaching original research. We conclude by suggesting the expanded use of primary literature in biology education."
fin_etd_13,"Studies in Income, Investment, and Stock Returns: The Permanent Income Hypothesis and the Overinvestment Puzzle",Finance,"cumulative increase in investment, firm investment, overinvestment, permanent income, stock return, transitory income","Increased sales drive earnings; increased earnings drive investment; and increased investment drives higher stock returns. In this dissertation, I studied the relationship of sales income, firm investment increase and stock returns. The first paper, titled ""Permanent Income and Investment"", investigates the relationship between changes in sales income and levels of investment. When firms experience increases in sales that they consider to be permanent, the present value of expected profits also increase, leading to increases in the firms' investments. Firm's investment behavior is primarily explained by permanent changes in sales incomes and not by transitory change. The second paper, titled ""Firm Investment and Stock Return"", investigates the relationship between investment and future returns of the firm. Recent dominant theory has considered the relationship between corporate investment and stock returns as negative due to overinvestment concerns, that is, the market initially under reacts to the possibility of overinvestment. This paper is the first full-scale empirical study that finds a positive relationship between corporate investment and stock returns if the investment increase/decrease is observed within a multiple-year framework rather than as a one year event. If firms continually increase investment, the investment/return relationship becomes positive. My explanation for this positive relationship is that investors prefer stocks with expected higher profit or growth potential, signaled by continued investment increase."
etd_599,STUDIES OF CELL MOTILITY AND DIFFERENTIATION IN COMPLEX 3D IN VITRO MICROENVIRONMENT,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"Cell behaviors, such as motility and differentiation, which are highly regulated by the complex 3D in vivo microenvironment, have been extensively studied in the past decades to better understand the mechanisms of development, disease, and healing. Due to the highly complex nature of the in vivo environment and limited resources and access to study cell behaviors in vivo, great efforts have been made to develop in vitro systems to mimic the in vivo microenvironment for a better understanding of cell-microenvironment interactions. However, most of the commonly used in vitro systems are static, which cannot mimic the dynamics of the microenvironment in vivo. In this dissertation, our goal was to create a 3D complex in vitro microenvironment that can dynamically change its internal architecture and to employ such in vitro dynamic complex microenvironment to study cell motility and differentiation behaviors for the application of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cancer metastasis.In this work, 3D dynamic shape memory scaffolds were developed and employed to investigate cell motility and differentiation behaviors when the cellular microenvironment dynamically changes in vitro. The scaffolds have fibrous structure, which can potentially mimic the collagen matrix fibrous structure in vivo. And, more importantly, the scaffolds can dynamically change internal architecture on command, which can potentially mimic the dynamic ECM architectural change in vivo during tissue development and cancer metastasis.To achieve this goal, the first part of this dissertation (Chapter 2 – 3) developed a programmable 3D shape memory electrospun scaffold that can dynamically change fiber alignment upon triggering under cytocompatible conditions. In these chapters, the programmable dynamic 3D scaffold was employed to study stem cell motility, cancer cell polarization, and cancer cell motility, for ultimate application in stem cell homing and cancer metastasis studies. Stem cell motility, cancer cell motility, and cancer cell morphology were found to be directed by shape-memory-actuated changes in scaffold internal architecture.In Chapter 4, the objective was to investigate stem cell differentiation when cells undergo dynamic scaffold internal architectural change for the application of bone tissue engineering and critical-sized bone defect treatment. The shape memory electrospun scaffold investigated in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, as well as a shape memory foam scaffold, were employed to examine the human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells osteogenic differentiation capacity. We found that the dynamic change of the scaffold internal architecture would not hinder the stem cell osteogenic differentiation.In Chapter 5, we utilized a scaffold-free 3D culture system and investigated the effect of a non-scaffold-related factor—low oxygen tension—on mature chondrocytes dedifferentiation behavior for the application of cartilage tissue engineering. Low oxygen has been frequently implicated as a limitation associated with synthetic 3D scaffolds when the scaffolds have small pore size or poor interconnectivity, or both, due to the fact that low oxygen and limited nutrient diffusion can cause cell death. However, low oxygen tension during culture could be beneficial for cartilage tissue engineering, as cartilage is an avascular tissue and low oxygen is present in vivo during chondrogenesis and in adult articular cartilage.Finally, in Chapter 6, conclusions and future directions are discussed and summarized."
etd_360,Study of homogeneous mineral acid dehydration of monosaccharides in a CSTR,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor, Dehydration, Homogeneous, Kinetics, Sugar Chemistry, Sulfuric Acid","Simple sugars (Aldohexoses/pentoses), (Ketohexoses/pentose) when subjected to a dehydration reaction, produce various compounds. An example of one such compound is 5-hydroxymethyl furfural. Such chemical products may be used in subsequent processing steps (hydrolysis, aldol condensation, hydrogenation and dehydration) to produce similarly structured condensed compounds that form the basis of complex molecules used in various industries such as production of fuels, chemical reagents and fertilizers. Most studies focus on heterogeneous packed beds and batch reactors to carry out dehydration reactions. This study illustrates use of a Continuous Stirred-Tank reactor to carry out such dehydration reactions. In order to maintain the homogenous nature of the reaction, the catalyst chosen was sulfuric acid. Use of a CSTR would allow study of kinetics and yields for varying residence times. This data could be used to design large scale operations in biomass processing. This study is aimed at investigating variables such as changing physical properties of the fluid reactant during reaction, variation in pH and consequent change in proton concentrations. By understanding the impact of these variables, more accurate rate measurements can be made. In the process of developing the right method for data acquisition, several substantial changes were made to the reactor and methods. These changes were instrumental in development of a cyclic process of data collection and changing methods and design, thus highlighting the chemical engineering heuristics approach and refinement in processes. The sequence of corrected results give us better insight into the process and help develop accurate models for the reactions in the scope of this thesis and also future studies. The presented results of rates and yields may be used to develop processes based on requirement and feasibility."
etd_558,"Suffering for Land: Environmental Hazards and Popular Struggles in the Brahmaputra Valley (Assam), India",Geography,"Brahmaputra Valley, Livelihoods, Natural Disasters, Political Ecology, Resistance and Social Movements, the State","The twin processes of flooding and riverbank erosion have over the years re-shaped the Brahmaputra Valley landscape in the northeast Indian state of Assam. While flooding and erosion have always been part of the natural landscape of the valley, they have now turned disastrous causing agro-ecological instability and large-scale displacement of the local population. This dissertation is based on sixteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in different parts of Assam, with a special focus on Majuli River Island, located in the middle of the Brahmaputra River, and Rohmoria in the upstream. It examines the political ecological processes of the re-production of disastrous geographies in the Brahmaputra Valley, the ways in which disasters have transformed rural livelihoods, and the politics of resistance among the disaster-affected population in the valley. At the heart of the dissertation lies the question of the state. By combining Marxist and postcolonial theorizations of the state and paying special attention to hydraulic infrastructures, my research presents an in-depth analysis of the role of the Indian state in the making of hazardscapes in Assam, thereby advancing our understanding of the state, especially in the postcolonial context. The dissertation also foregrounds the question of popular resistance in the valley, demonstrating that disaster-affected communities are not mere victims of disasters but that they have political agencies, which they deploy, given the conducive circumstances, to re-shape environmental governance processes and the state in general. Throughout the study, I advance an analysis of the ways in which hazardscapes are produced through the multi-scalar interactions between political economic processes, state and non-state actors, and biophysical nature."
etd_287,Surface Plasmon Polaritons: Guided-wave Devices and Applications,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Metal-insulator-metal plasmon waveguide, Networked Plasmonic Devices, Surface Plasmon Polaritons","The prospect of controlling the interaction of light with matter at nanoscale has been widely studied in recent years, and entails characterizing optical and optoelectronic devices at resolution higher than the diffraction limit. One technique that allows localization of light to sub-wavelength dimensions is through the use of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) wherein the interaction of light with free electrons on a metal surface can lead to a bound surface electromagnetic field that is confined to deep sub-wavelength dimensions. Studies based on SPPs merged with the field of nanotechnology have resulted in novel imaging technologies, nonlinear and quantum-optical devices and the ability to design materials with unusual electromagnetic properties with potential applications ranging from enhancing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices to detection of bio-molecules at ultra-small concentrations.Here we report the design of nanophotonic devices based on SPP waveguide structures that would act as a true counterpart to today’s electronic devices, providing orders of increase in data speeds while maintaining nanoscale dimensions. The devices are based on metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) waveguide structures composed of Ag/SiO2/Ag heterostructure that utilizes interference effect within multiple intersecting plasmonic waveguides. We have explored guided-wave devices such as L and T-bends, 4-way-splitters and 2x2-networked structures, wherein by altering the device geometry one can tune its operating frequency, and by changing the angle of incidence one can switch these devices between ON/OFF states. We plan to fabricate and experimentally characterize these devices for applications in color routing, directional filters and optical switches. We discuss preliminary design rules and constraints based on results obtained from finite-difference-time-domain simulations."
che_etd_202,Synthesis and Processing of Core/Alloy Nanoparticles: Optical Properties and Morphological Evolutions,Chemistry,"Core/Alloy, Morphological Evolutions, Nanoparticles, Optical Properties, Processing","In this thesis, I describe the synthesis and processing of core/alloy nanoparticles (NPs) from the two major perspectives: optical properties and morphological evolutions. In Chapter 2, I take advantage of atomic interdiffusion at nanoparticle interfaces to fabricate Au/AuxAg1-x core/alloy and Au/AuxAg1-x/Ag core/alloy/shell nanoparticles. The alloy formation and subsequent interdiffusion allowed us to tailor nanoparticle composition and ultrastructure, as well as surface plasmon response (SPR). The resulting surface plasmon resonance signatures were modeled as a function of alloy or monometallic shell thickness, as well as alloy composition, using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method.In Chapter 3, I discusse the synthesis of Au/AuxAg1-x/Ag nanoparticles (NPs) further in terms of the effects of temperatures and reducing agents. Temperature range from TH = 90 - 215 oC and the reducing agents--ascorbic acid and sodium borohydride were examined.In Chapter 4, I investigate the internal composition and microstructure of plasmonic core/alloy nanoparticles (NPs) by comparing changes in SPR signature in depth with DDA simulations. Depending on the processing temperature, alloying occurs at the core/shell interface. The extent of alloying was related to changes in the SPR. Using DDA in conjunction with TEM determined morphology, we are able to determine alloy shell composition (x) and thickness (tS). Through a series of core/alloy models with x = 0.2 - 0.8, and shell thickness to core radius ratios (tS/rC) of 0.05 - 1.0. Using this approach we are able to produce a variety of SPR rich features, which can reproduce the experimental results.In Chapter 5, I describe the sulfidation of Au/Ag core/shell and Au/AuxAg1-x core/alloy nanoparticles (NPs), where interesting diffusion process and morphological changes upon sulfidation are shown. The sulfidation leads to the formation Au/Ag2S asymmetric heterodimers with a Janus-like geometry.In Chapter 6, I explore the oxidation properties of Fe/FexCr1-x core/alloy NPs with stainless steel like interfaces. These particles show a unique morphological transformation that is induced by surface oxidation, oxide passivation, and vacancy coalescence. In Chapter 7, I describe the preliminary results that are based on the further processing of core-void-shell morphologies described in Chapter 6."
che_etd_185,Synthesis and Structural Studies of Calcium and Magnesium Phosphinate and Phosphonate Compounds,Chemistry,"Alkaline earth metal, Bone scaffold, Crystallization, Metal Organic Framework, Phosphonates, X-ray crystallography","The work presented herein describes synthetic methodologies leading to the design of a wide array of magnesium and calcium based phosphinate and phosphonates with possible applications as bone scaffolding materials or additives to bone cements. The challenge to the chemistry of the alkaline earth phosphonate target compounds includes poor solubility of compounds, and poorly understood details on the control of the metal's coordination environment. Hence, less is known on phosphonate based alkaline earth metal organic frameworks as compared to transition metal phosphonates. Factors governing the challenges in obtaining crystalline, well-defined magnesium and calcium solids lie in the large metal diameters, the absence of energetically available d-orbitals to direct metal geometry, as well as the overall weakness of the metal-ligand bonds.A significant part of this project was concerned with the development of suitable reaction conditions to obtain X-ray quality crystals of the reaction products to allow for structural elucidation of the novel compounds. Various methodologies to aid in crystal growth including hydrothermal methods and gel crystallization were employed.We have used phosphinate and phosphonate ligands with different number of phosphorus oxygen atoms as well as diphosphonates with different linker lengths to determine their effects on the overall structural features. An interesting correlation is observed between the dimensionality of products and the increasing number of donor oxygen atoms in the ligands as we progress from phosphinic acid to the phosphorous acids. As an example, monophosphinate ligand only yielded one-dimensional compounds, whereas the phosphonates crystallize as one and two-dimensional compounds, and the di- and triphosphonate based compounds display two or three-dimensional geometries.This thesis provides a selection of calcium and magnesium compounds with one-dimensional geometry, as represented in a calcium phosphinate to novel two-dimensional sheets of magnesium and pillared calcium phosphonates. The preparation of these novel compounds has led to the establishment of synthetic protocols that allow for the direct preparation of compounds with defined structural features."
etd_738,Synthesis of heteroaromatic ruthenium dyes for use as electron reservoirs  in dye-sensitized solar cells,Chemistry,"dye-sensitized solar cells, electron reservoir, photovoltaics, polypyridine, ruthenium, up-conversion","Increasing the usable portion of solar spectrum is a key factor in increasing the efficiency of modern solar cells.  The near-IR region of the solar spectrum is often underutilized as a means of energy production, as the photons in this region do not contain enough energy to promote electrons to the conducting band of common semiconductors used in photovoltaics.  To help achieve this goal, the creation of an electron reservoir was attempted. The electron reservoir would be a holding place for an electron that is excited by a sub-bandgap photon until another photon excites it to the conduction band.The first chapter of this dissertation describes the basics of dye-sensitized solar cell technology and the requirements and characteristics of an electron reservoir. It also discusses characteristics that molecules would need to have in order to act as electron reservoirs.  The electron reservoirs envisioned consist of multi-metal complexes with at least three metal centers and the presence of a near-IR absorption in the mixed-valence state.The second chapter describes the synthesis of a number mono- and diruthenium of building blocks that were used to create larger triruthenium molecules.  Most notable of these was bis(4,4’-dicarboxy-2,2’-bipyridine)(2,2’-bipyrimidine)ruthenium(II) hexafluorophosphate.  The two 4,4’-dicarboxy-2,2’-bipyridine ligands allow strong attachment of the complex to TiO2 and the 2,2’-bipyrimidine ligand allows for additional ruthenium centers to be attached.The third chapter describes the creation of a series of triruthenium complexes.  Initially, an unsuccessful combinatorial synthesis was attempted using TiO2 as a stationary phase. Afterwards, a series of triruthenium complexes were made using the mono- and diruthenium building blocks previously made.  None of the complexes synthesized had a near-IR absorption in their mixed-valence state.The fourth chapter describes the synthesis of a cyclometalated diruthenium complex made using 2,3,5,6-tetra-(2-pyridyl)pyridine as a bridging ligand.  A strong mixed-valence near-IR absorbance was seen at 1370 nm.The fifth chapter describes the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells and the photovoltaic results obtained using the dyes from chapters two through four.  The solar cells tested had efficiencies of 0.3% to 0.7%.  However, no current was generated from photons in the near-IR region."

Previous computational research has shown that both polyhedral carborane compounds and sterically constrained hydrindacene show great potential as NLO compounds. Their calculated ? values exceed those of compounds currently in use. Initial synthetic obstacles in the formation of polyhedral carborane based compounds led us to investigate targets using multiple polyhedral cage bridges. Initial calculations on these compounds have shown promising results. [2-[2-(3,4-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)-o-carborane]-o-carborane]-tropylium, 27, in particular has shown great promise at a target for synthesis. Preliminary synthetic attempts towards homo- and hetero- polyhedral cage compounds are reported.Current synthesis towards hindered organic NLO molecules have shown promise, with some synthetic difficulties encountered. Multiple pathways for the initial target, 4-tropylium-8-(3,4-diphenylcyclopentadienyl)-1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octamethyl-s-hydrindacene have been created and tested with varying results. These synthetic strategies include nucleophilic addition into a preformed bridge, formation of a bridge from a substituted quinarene compound, and a multistep partial backbone construction method which will be discussed further in Chapter 3. Calculational exploration of extended quinarene/hydrindacene hybrids for their use as NLO materials have yielded mixed results, varying with amount of extension of the pendant groups. Initial synthesis of these materials have shown great promise and shall be discussed in Chapter 4."
etd_274,"Synthetic, Structural, and Mechanistic Investigations of Vitamin B12 Conjugates of the Anorectic Peptide PYY3-36",Chemistry,,"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, with nearly 40% of the adult population (age 18+) being considered obese (defined as a body mass index of ? 30). Appetite-regulating gut hormones such as peptide YY (PYY) have recently garnered interest in combatting obesity. PYY has been shown to have clinical relevance in appetite control and energy homeostasis. The truncated form of PYY, PYY3-36, potentiates an anorectic effect upon activation of the Y2 receptor through both the central and peripheral nervous system. The positive appetite-regulating effects of PYY3-36 have generated interest of pharmaceutical development to treat obesity. A major component of PYY3-36 research is the desire to produce a medically relevant, patient compliant route of administration, either through oral or subcutaneous (sc) delivery. Vitamin B12 (B12) is implemented as the drug delivery vehicle for PYY3-36, and is hypothesized to serve as a means of protection and/or improved pharmacodynamics/pharamacokinetics in vivo.Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and quantitative structure-activity investigations of a series of B12-PYY3-36 conjugates show that, along with the exact location chosen for conjugation between B12 and the peptide, the distance (as measured by linker length) between B12 and peptide is critical to consider for optimal Y2 receptor activation. In addition, the first pharmacodynamic studies of a select B12-PYY3-36 conjugate are presented, which show that reduction of food intake via B12-PYY3-36 is improved (> 10%) compared to PYY3-36 upon sc administration. The improved effects observed are postulated to be from increased tissue distribution of B12-PYY3-36 versus PYY3-36, as evidenced by subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis. Through corresponding in vitro and in vivo studies, a Y2 receptor-mediated process was also confirmed through observations of a C-terminally conjugated B12-PYYC36 null conjugate."

In fact, the official AOSP versions have been aggressively customized into thousands of system images by everyone in the customization chain, such as device manufacturers, vendors, carriers, etc. If not well thought-out, the customization process could result in serious security problems. This dissertation performs a systematic investigation of Android customization’ inconsistencies with regards to security aspects at various Android layers.It brings to light new vulnerabilities, never investigated before, caused by the under-regulated and complex Android customization. It first describes a novel vulnerability ""Hare"" and proves that it is security critical and extensive affecting devices from major vendors. A new tool is proposed to detect the Hare problem and to protect affected devices. This dissertation further discovers security configuration changes through a systematic differential analysis among custom devices from different vendors and demonstrates that they could lead to severe vulnerabilities if introduced unintentionally."
ppa_etd_89,Taking Nonprofits at Their Word: The Role of Conflict over Mission in Organizational Change and Response to Environmental Pressures,Public Administration,"Change, Interpretation, Mission, Nonprofit, Process","Central to any nonprofit is a mission; a defining purpose and set of values that provide its exempt purpose, differentiate it and motivate action by the organization and others on its behalf. Even the most formal and established mission is subject to redefinition, interpretation and different ideas over achieving it. This dissertation addresses the question of what role these interpretations of mission play in the processes by which nonprofits change, not just mission but also leadership, strategy and structure.     Two distinct theoretical models are examined for fit with empirical results: (1) change processes as a response to external pressure moderated by organizational characteristics, from organization theory and nonprofit management research, and (2) change processes as internal contests over ideas, adapted from global and national level advocacy and policy process theories. Mixed methods are used to address this research question and evaluate the two models. Logistic regression of panel data on 152 internationally active nonprofits over 14 years is used to identify factors correlated with various changes. Through process tracing, narratives of change for a series of four case studies on similar nonprofits are developed. Comparisons within cases, across the four, between the qualitative and quantitative elements, and with theory are used to explore the fit between results and the two models of change.     This dissertation proposes and finds evidence of two new concepts: (1) personal mission conceptions, the different interpretations of mission held by individuals or groups within a nonprofit; and (2) dominant mission conceptions, the consensus interpretation at a particular time. Evidence from both forms of analysis provide little support for the organization theory model of change, while the case studies establish support for a potential model of internal politics wherein coalitions form around common mission conceptions, compete with the status quo or other coalitions, and push for particular changes."

The ethnographic study conducted over a three year period highlights the voices of the young black men and provides insight into their experiences with state-sponsored forms of criminalization by police and schools that perpetuate under-education, trauma, and violence through the implementation of an anti-gang program. This research project includes extensive participant observations and formal interviews with young black men labeled as gang members, as well as key institutional stakeholders, such as law enforcement officers, major politicians, and social service providers instrumental in policing and servicing young black men labeled as gang members. Overall, this project is a study of the collateral consequences of mass incarceration which highlights the voices of these young black men and illustrates how they navigate institutions once labeled as gang members. In addition, this project examines the rhetoric around gangs which contribute to the formal and social policing of the masculinity of young black men. Ultimately, this project provides insight into the network of state-sponsored policies and practices that criminalize young black men labeled as gang members."
etd_66,"TAXATION, SOCIAL SECURITY, AND HEALTH INSURANCE",Economics,"Health Insurance, Social Security, Taxation","This dissertation is composed of three papers that study aspects in social insurance system in the U.S. The first paper seeks to further understand the effect of public insurance expansions on private insurance market. In particular, it investigates the spillover effect of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--the most recent and largest public insurance expansion prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA)--on employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) premiums. The last two papers explore distortions of tax provisions in the Social Security system on older taxpayers' economic behavior.In the first paper, I analyze the extent to which ESI premiums are affected by SCHIP. ESI premiums can be affected because the health composition of the ESI pool may change due to the crowd-out effect. The lower income families that are eligible for public health insurance tend to have worse health than the average working family (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012). Therefore, individuals who drop ESI coverage once their children become eligible for SCHIP or their children have worse than average health. The resulting ESI risk pool becomes less costly to insurance companies, which leads to a decline of the average premiums for those who remain in the ESI insurance pool. Thus, overall premiums would decline even though the majority in the pool is not eligible for public insurance. My estimates, relying on variations in time of implementation and size of expansions across states, indicate that ESI premiums would have increased by about two percent, had SCHIP not been expanded. It confirms that the SCHIP- eligible children and their family members who give up ESI have relatively poor health.The second paper investigates older taxpayers' response to the taxation of Social Security benefits in two dimensions, income responses and Social Security claiming decisions, using a nonparametric graphical methodology and a panel of administrative data from individual incometax and information returns. Social Security benefits are taxed under a complex regime that raises marginal effective tax rates by up to 85 percent, which could discourage labor supply of older workers. While previous research found that the labor supply of older workers is significantly affected by the Social Security earnings test and the implicit taxes created by the Social Security benefit formula, we find little evidence of response to the benefit taxation. Only single, self-employed people show any evidence of reducing their Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to avoid the tax and the response is much smaller and less precisely estimated than the response Saez (2010) found to the phase-out of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Similarly, while the taxation of benefits provides an incentive for many to delay claiming, we find no evidence of such an effect. Overall, the findings suggest that the taxation of benefits creates little distortion on older taxpayers if they completely understand the taxation. Or older taxpayers have little understanding of the rules governing Social Security benefit taxation.The last paper studies the effect of the Social Security earnings test on economic behavior of the elderly. This paper provides a new piece of evidence to the relatively large literature of the earnings test, which has found inconsistent labor market responses. It builds upon the non- parametric methodology developed by Saez (2010) to quantify the compensated elasticity of income with respect to the net-of-tax rate using bunching behavior discovered in income distributions. Draw the same administrative data as in the second paper, we observe significant clustering to the left of the exempt amount for 63-64 year olds, who are the candidates subjected to the earnings test. The significant bunching translates into 0.04-0.09 in the compensated elasticity of income for the overall sample. Moreover, both the bunching and the significant elasticity are driven by wage earners. It reflects real behavioral responses rather than adjustments in the reporting process that is possible among the self-employed because wage income isreported by a third party to the tax authority and thus is less susceptible to manipulation than income from self-employment."
etd_151,Teacher Allies: An Exploration of the Professional Experiences of Teachers Who Support LGBTQ Students,Cultural Foundations of Education,"LGBT allies, social foundations, teachers","This dissertation is a year-long qualitative exploration of the experiences and perspectives of classroom teachers who identify as ""allies"" or ""supporters"" for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) public school students. Nine teachers representing five secondary schools in Central New York participated in three semi-structured interviews and approximately fifteen hours of classroom observation. Questions driving this research focused on (1) how teacher allies make meaning of LGBTQ students' needs and their roles in addressing those needs; (2) how participants integrate ""ally"" work into the larger context of their professional practice; and (3) participants' management of stigma or resistance around their ""ally"" work. Findings illuminate how educators engage in the work of supporting LGBTQ students without directly speaking about or acknowledging how gender and sexuality are relevant to experiences of teaching and learning. Educators instead framed the needs of LGBTQ students and the possibilities for improving their school experiences within broader frameworks of supporting diversity, teaching tolerance, safe schools, and anti-bullying. It will be argued that these frameworks provide rhetorical and instructional tools for talking about and implementing strategies that aim to encompass the needs of ""all students"" but do not require educators to consider how or why heterosexual, gender conforming identities are privileged and LGBTQ identities are marginalized in school environments."

The concept of emotional geographies, as defined by Hargreaves' Emotional Geographies of Teaching framework (2001a), was used as a tool to interpret pre-service teachers' actions and reflections. Standardized individuals (SIs) were hired and trained to perform as parents in a parent-teacher conference and to implement specific triggers to create a controlled environment during the clinical simulations. The collection of data was focused on (a) exploring how the pre-service teachers' personal experiences, beliefs, and values affected their facilitation and decision-making skills, (b) investigating how emotional geographies manifested in the pre-service teachers' actions and reflections, and (c) providing information on how clinical simulations might be used as an experiential tool to help pre-service teachers explore, identify and re-construct their dispositions, beliefs, and values. The findings indicate that although pre-service teachers used their personal experience to make decisions and facilitate the discussion, their lack of professional experience impaired their decision-making and facilitation skills. There is also evidence that the pre-service teachers' beliefs, values, and former experience regarding their career choices affected their actions and reflections. Elements of sociocultural, moral, political, and professional geographies were potent throughout the interactions between the pre-service teachers and the standardized parents. Clinical simulations could be used as an experiential teaching methodology to better prepare pre-service teachers to explore their dispositions and establish effective interactions with parents and the communities in which they work."
etd_232,Teaching Artistry as a Critical Community of Practice: An arts-based ethnography,Teaching and Leadership,"arts-based research, arts education, critical pedagogy, ethnography, social justice, teaching artist","There is increasing inequity in access to arts education among students in the United States that corresponds to an increase in demand for teaching artists - career artists who apply their artistry to teaching and learning. These increases have been documented both as a benefit and as a threat to arts instruction that is provided within standardized public school curricula. In turn, policy debate has emerged around professional positioning and development of teaching artists. This arts-based ethnographic study investigates resistance by teaching artists in the United States to policy recommendations for formal credentialing of the work that they do (Rabkin, et al, 2011). The researcher, as a participant in the study community of over forty teaching artists who contributed to the Teaching Artist Journal ""ALT/space"" blog, engaged in ethnographic fieldwork for over two years. Through content analysis, interviews, and exquisite corpse analysis of narratives, a critical community of practice theory emerged as a structure for better understanding individual artist, learner, and teacher roles in an arts education ecosystem. The arts-based blending of methods within this study reflects a dynamic tension between artistic and educational practices that can be found at the core of teaching artist practices and may be of value to future education research and advocacy."

The study examined the educators’ life histories and experiences in traditional teacher preparation programs. The goal of this research was to investigate the way teachers’ life histories, including early educational experiences in K-12 schooling and teacher preparation within traditional and historically white institutions, inform their approaches to teaching and enacting activist literacies. For the purpose of this study, I define activist literacies as thinking, understanding, and acting with deliberate intention. Framed by existing theories on black feminist thought, intersectionality, and critical race theory, as well as by research on teacher preparation programs and social justice education, this study employs qualitative data collection methods that include written narratives and interviews. An additional layer of data was obtained through an autoethnographic approach. Data drawn from in-depth interviews and reviews of participants’ submitted narratives were analyzed to present illustrations of the various ways in which teachers are activists. In examining both individual narratives and interview transcripts, this study found themes related to marginalization and isolation. This study helps the field think critically about how to cultivate and support teachers to engage in social justice work that seeks to disrupt patterns of privilege and oppression while simultaneously advancing a new teacher preparation model grounded and informed by the historical legacy of Black women educators and their current work in classrooms, schools and communities."

Located at the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, this fortified trading post was important to the French (1715-1760) and British (1761-1781) fur trade economies in North America. Archaeological data and historic documents describing the use, trade, and demand for iron products at Fort Michilimackinac are used to understand the blacksmith and his work within the 18th century fur trade frontier and the wider socioeconomic landscape of which he was part. Blacksmiths were essential in supporting the material needs of frontier communities and the technological adaptations necessitated by frontier conditions are examined through the archaeological remains of the blacksmith workshops at Fort Michilimackinac, as well as metal artifacts found across the site. A model for identifying blacksmithing activities within workshops was applied to archaeological data from Fort Michilimackinac and three blacksmith workshops were identified. These are described in terms of the archaeological features represented and their spatial attributes. Several artifact groups were selected for analysis based on trade records and other historic documents that described their local production and/or repair at the fort. Trends in repair methods and potential technological adaptations of blacksmithing techniques exhibited by these repairs are identified. Portable x-ray fluorescence analysis was used to further examine traits of frontier metals and identify types of artifacts that were likely produced by the blacksmiths at Fort Michilimackinac. By examining the blacksmith and his work, this research contributes to a holistic understanding of the fur trade frontier and the importance of individuals and craftsmen, like the blacksmith, within the communities that aided the continued success of the fur trade and European expansion in North America."
etd_122,Technology Adoption in Secondary Mathematics Teaching in Kenya: An Explanatory Mixed Methods Study,Teaching and Leadership,"Adoption, diffusion of innovations theory, Kenya, mathematics, Rogers, Technology and ICT","This study examined the factors related to technology adoption by secondary mathematics teachers in Nyandarua and Nairobi counties in the Republic of Kenya. Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods approach, I collected qualitative data from interviews and classroom observations of six teachers to better understand statistical results from the quantitative survey of 135 teachers, and drew on Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory. In the initial quantitative phase, using multiple regression analysis, I identified six explanatory variables related to technology adoption that resulted in R square of 61.2% and adjusted R square of 59.3%. These six variables and the corresponding standardized regression coefficients (Beta) are as follows: age of a teacher (-.321), school type (.267), Internet at home and school (.245), educational technology in general (.301), in-service training (.527), and discussions about technology (.161). In the qualitative phase, the participants described how technology training, technology resources, and demographics influenced their decisions to adopt technology in their teaching. Overall, the findings revealed that secondary mathematics teachers in Kenya lacked technology skills and technology training was low, the Internet supported early adopters in self-training, access to learning resources, and teacher collaboration, while a lack of adequate technology resources hampered technology adoption, the late adopters' had negative views about technology in learning environments and where technology was available the teachers were not using technology for teaching mathematics. Some of the non-significant variables included gender, education level, time, ownership of laptop computer, and computer lab. Indeed, qualitative data revealed that time to complete the syllabus and to prepare technology-enhanced lessons inhibited teachers' decisions to adopt technology in mathematics teaching. Through this study, I conclude that in-service training is the most significant factor in technology adoption process over and above the availability of technology resources while the relationship between school type and age of a teacher on a mathematics teacher's technology adoption score were not well understood. For this reason, technology training programs for teachers need to be reevaluated to consider committing technology trainers who understand technology, training teachers on specific mathematical software, establishing training centers near teachers' localities, and encouraging collaboration efforts. This study suggests recommendations for further research to understand technology adoption in secondary mathematics teaching in Kenya."

Presented here are investigations of crystalline biological molecules and pharmaceutical compounds by THz spectroscopy and solid-state density functional theory (DFT). The primary objective of this research was the refinement of computational methods for the accurate simulation of crystal structures and experimental THz spectra. Considerable efforts were made in the augmentation of DFT methods with corrections for London-type dispersion forces. It was discovered that many molecular solids require the incorporation of these weak forces in order to achieve proper structural optimizations and frequency calculations. Modifications to the dispersion parameters improved the results of the calculations, and could be tuned for a specific system to further improve performance. The reliability of dispersion-corrected DFT in the structural and spectral reproductions for known crystal structures led to the development of a method for predictions of previously unknown crystal structures. The research presented in this thesis has provided benchmarks for solid-state DFT calculations of biological and pharmaceutical solids by presenting rigorous evaluations of computational performances, and providing insight into the underlying physical origins of lattice vibrations active in the THz spectral region."

First, a four-week, one-on-one training (one hour twice a week) for three Chinese learners of English as a second language (ESL) was conducted, employing the application of minimal pairs within different approaches - TESOL and SLP - to examine their effectiveness on the accuracy of sound production. All together five sounds were targeted (i.e., the velar nasal /eta/, the voiceless interdental fricative /theta/, the voiced labiodental fricative /v/, the voiced labial-velar approximate /w/ and the voiced alveolar liquid /l/). Second, a semi-structured interview was conducted to explore the applications of pronunciation teaching techniques and methods by professionals in each field. A number of areas were explored: practitioners' understanding of pronunciation/speech sound development, their preparedness for pronunciation teaching, and their attitudes towards practitioners in the other field.Our findings from the first study suggested that when the technique of minimal pairs was applied within a segment-focused SLP approach, ESL participants were able to achieve higher accuracy in speech of shorter units such as passive task (i.e., tasks with scripts). In contrast, when minimal pairs were incorporated implicitly within a communicative, goal-orientated TESOL approach, ESL speakers were able to achieve better performance in active spontaneous productions (i.e., tasks without scripts). The second study showed that the TESOL professionals interviewed believed that intelligibility was more important than accuracy; while the SLP professionals maintained the incredible importance of accurate pronunciation. Finally, overall, SLP participants expressed stronger confidence in their readiness to teach both L1 and L2 English pronunciation than did TESOL professionals."

One of the many noteworthy aspects of this movement is its extensive use of scientific authority. On the basis of seven months of ethnographic research at Shantikunj, the main ashram of the Gayatri Pariwar, I seek to understand the role of scientific authority for the movement. In the Gayatri Pariwar, scientific discourses draw attention to the shared nature of the human body through a rhetoric that connects health and morality. This imparts a sense of universality to their practices, setting them up as technologies for building a healthy, moral, and coherent nation out of India's sometimes-fractious diversity. This strategy has roots in late colonial and early postcolonial India, but is as relevant as ever in the contemporary period. Not only does it have substantial appeal to the rapidly growing number of Indians who have been educated in science, technology, or related fields, but it also carries with it the promise that the Gayatri Pariwar can project its scientifically universalized practices through global communication networks."

A confluence of propositions within paternal involvement frameworks, the bio-ecological systems model, the family stress model, and risk and resilience frameworks guided the framing of the questions and hypotheses. The sample consisted of 3,045 African American, European American and Hispanic American fathers and their young children. Families were randomly assigned to a treatment and a control group. Analyses employed Bayesian multi-group path analysis. Results indicate that economic hardship was positively associated with paternal depressive symptoms for fathers in the complier and control groups. Paternal depressive symptoms were negatively associated with paternal engagement in social and cognitive activities, caregiving activities, and physical play, and positively associated with children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors regardless of whether fathers received relationship skills education or not. For fathers in the complier and control groups, paternal depressive symptoms were positively associated with internalizing behavior indirectly through paternal engagement in caregiving activities. Data are discussed in terms of the possible influence of relationship skills education on the links between economic hardship, paternal depressive symptoms, paternal involvement, and children’s behavioral difficulties."

The role of education should be to encourage students to be creative and foster a love for continuous learning; however, this does not seem to be the case in many traditional school systems. In order to address the growing needs of different types of learners who are no longer engaged in traditional settings, alternative education sites have become a popular answer for some families.This qualitative case study focuses on one particular alternative learning environment that implements the Big Picture School model of learning in a rural setting. This model emphasizes student-centered learning within a supportive environment that assists students in taking ownership of their learning through a student-interest-based curriculum. The ultimate goal of this type of school is to teach one student at a time through authentic learning opportunities that are student-interest driven.The purpose of this study is to examine how students experience the Big Picture School model of learning and how the school structures that experience, from the perspective of students. Through participant observations, interviews with students and school stakeholders, focus group sessions with students, and the analysis of school documents, the findings reveal an alternative learning environment that focuses truly on student learning. Listening to students and utilizing their interests to write meaningful, relevant curriculums, while incorporating internships and college course work with high school required academics, and collaborating with community businesses all contribute to higher levels of student engagement and motivation in the learning environment."
eng_etd_62,"The Body Machinic: Technology, Labor, and Mechanized Bodies in Victorian Culture",English,"Bodies, British literature, Labor, Marxist, Technology, Victorian","While recent scholarship focuses on the fluidity or dissolution of the boundary between body and machine, ""The Body Machinic"" historicizes the emergence of the categories of ""human"" and ""mechanical"" labor. Beginning with nineteenth-century debates about the mechanized labor process, these categories became defined in opposition to each other, providing the ideological foundation for a dichotomy that continues to structure thinking about our relation to technology. These perspectives are polarized into technophobic fears of dehumanization and machines ""taking over,"" or technological determinist celebrations of new technologies as improvements to human life, offering the tempting promise of maximizing human efficiency. ""The Body Machinic"" argues that both sides to this dichotomy function to mask the ways the apparent body-machine relation is always the product of human social relations that become embedded in the technologies of the labor process.Chapter 1 identifies the emergence of this dichotomy in the 1830s ""Factory Question"" debates: while critics of the factory system described workers as tools appended to monstrous, living machines, apologists claimed large-scale industrial machinery relieved human toil by replicating the laboring body in structure and function. Chapters 2 examines factory workers' autobiographies which record their experiences of being treated like machine parts, disposed of when broken by gruesome factory accidents. Chapter 3 analyzes Trollope's Michael Armstrong and Tonna's Helen Fleetwood, in which merely occupying the space of the factory initiates workers' transformations into a dangerously politicized yet mindless ""community of automata."" Chapter 4 analyzes Babbage's mathematical theory, his Difference Engine, and Dickens's representation of Babbage in Little Dorrit to argue that representations of mechanization were crucial to debates about the category of mental labor, which we continue to define as productive of intellectual property through its categorical opposition to mechanized manual labor. The conclusion looks at Butler's Erewhon and argues that the particular forms of technophobia and technophilia that dominate today--in which humans become increasingly mechanical, or machines become increasingly life-like--are a direct inheritance of Victorian constructions of human and mechanical as categorically opposed, and of the resulting metaphor of the mechanized laboring body."
hst_etd_100,The British Occupation of Southern New York during the American Revolution and the Failure to Restore Civilian Government,History,"American Revolution, British Occupation, New York","A decade of political unrest over the question of parliamentary taxation resulted in the development of an alternate political structure of committees and congresses in the province of New York. By 1776, a revolutionary government led by the Provincial Congress controlled the province. Upon learning of the Declaration of Independence, the New York Provincial Congress declared independence from the British. Within months of this declaration, southern New York was occupied by British troops, and remained under British control for the duration of the Revolutionary War. The area was under martial law for the duration. Britain's loss of the Saratoga Campaign brought French entry into the war, and a major strategic reassessment as the American colonies became to the British but one front--and not even the most important--in a world war with France (and later others). A peace commission led by the Earl of Carlisle was sent to America, spending time in Philadelphia and New York, but its proposals were met with contempt. Partially as a result of the failed mission, a new strategy was developed for fighting the war by the British. A major part of this new strategy was the restoration of civilian government to the province of New York. It was hoped that, among other things, this would showcase Britain's desire to, rather than impose a tyranny, restore free government to the colonies. General James Robertson was chosen to be the new governor, arriving in 1780, but was unable to implement the strategy because of opposition by Sir Henry Clinton, the commander of Britain's forces in America.The dissertation examines the developing break with Britain, the occupation, and the failure of the attempt to restore civilian government it. The dissertation examines the effect that various appalling, violent or questionable acts by British troops or officers had on the people of New York, and discusses briefly how British military actions and the occupation affected the developing independent New York government. It contrasts events in Georgia, where civilian government, complete with an assembly was created, with events in New York. Lastly, the dissertation examines the question of whether the restoration of civilian government was just too late in 1780 to have been an effective strategy to win back the loyalties of New Yorkers and Americans, even if civilian government had been restored."

New York City and the 8th Ward neighborhood of the church were rapidly urbanizing and diversifying in the early 19th century. These changes affected how children lived and grew. Family life, institutional involvement, and the city itself are considered as structuring forces that helped shape the skeletal remains of the children that did not survive. This dissertation combines historical data, theoretical models of embodiment and agency, and skeletal data to reconstruct their experiences of growing up in a rapidly changing cityscape. In particular, trends in health, diet, and trauma are noted. These trends are established first for sub-groupings of children based on cultural defined age stages, and then combined to examine the life course. This project is therefore a theoretical microhistory of childhood, a novel approach to discussing the bodies of children in the past."

The study found that the schools responded to the reform out of school people's practical concerns as well the established school cultures.  Meanwhile, schools' implementation decisions were mediated by the interpretation powers of local educational authorities.  Merits School arrived at the two-faces strategy to implement the reform.  Pioneer School managed to maintain a balance between promoting reform pedagogies and employing examination-oriented approaches.  Both schools marginally involved parents in the implementation of the reform.  This study suggests that to achieve successful reformers need to place equal emphasis on the transformation of teachers as well as local policymakers.  Future studies may employ quantitative research methods and investigate in larger scale how schools in China enact the reform to date."

Using in-depth interviewing and a narrative analysis approach, specific attention is focused on classed experiences resulting from academic engagement. The project addresses the following questions: How do ""first generation"" Ph.D.s from ""working class backgrounds"" describe and story their doctoral education experience? And how does class appear in, and impact academic persistence in their stories? By examining the representational strategies these Ph.D.s use, the study animates discourse on social inequalities in higher education in the United States.All but one of the 17 participants in the study are in disciplines within the Humanities, a field unique for its high rate of doctoral program attrition and historic composition of Ph.D.s from families where both parents hold advanced degrees. Findings reveal that class is a significant element in the stories of these Ph.D.s, impacting their understandings of relationships, self, and advanced training in the disciplines. In this study, participants reported that the ability to manage class conflict over time was an important element in the ability to persist academically. This finding suggests that the underrepresentation of Ph.D.s from working class backgrounds is not simply a case of a preference not to enter doctoral programs, or to persist once in them, but rather an indication that these students suffer socially, academically and financially even while persisting through school. The study's findings are presented in a series of five individual profiles and a discussion of themes found throughout the participant's narratives."
etd_556,The Competing Risks of Prepayment and Default on the Single-Family Mortgage Market,Economics,"A class of discrete transformation survival models, Multinomial logit model, Sueyoshi proportional hazards model, Termination risks of Single-family mortgages, The Competing Risks Model, The Competing Risks of Prepayment and Default","This study contains three chapters. Since the subprime crisis, it has become increasingly important to understand the competing risks of prepayment and default on the single-family mortgage market. This research studies the economic factors that affect the competing risks of prepayment and default in locations where the aggregate of the prepayment risk and the default risk are simultaneously high.Chapter 1 outlines the analysis based on thirty-year, fixed-rate, single-family mortgages in five Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs): Phoenix, Miami, Tampa, Detroit and Las Vegas. These MSAs are chosen from a sample Single-family Loan-Level Dataset constructed by Freddie Mac based on high simultaneous prepayment and default rates. The results are estimated by a discrete time competing risks model based on restricted multinomial logit. Two different combinations of dependent variables are used to make the analysis more comprehensive. The first combination is prepayment and default and the second is prepayment and 90-days-delinquency.The indicator for a prepayment penalty and the value of the call option are used to evaluate the prepayment risk and the best three combinations (using the Bayesian information criterion) of explanatory variables – the value of negative equity, a negative equity dummy, and original loan-to-value ratio – together with the unemployment rate are used to evaluate the default risk. Because of the ambiguous effect of the credit score on the prepayment decision discussed in the previous literature, two estimations to explain the effect of the credit score on the prepayment and default are run. One estimation considers how the credit score affects both termination risks and the other considers how the credit score affects only default. The effect of the debt-to-income ratio on the prepayment and default is also tested.By controlling other mortgage characteristics, such as loan size and loan age, the brief summary of results shows us the prepayment penalty has a negative effect on the prepayment decision. However, its effect in Detroit is insignificantly positive. The value of the call option has a significantly positive impact on the prepayment in each MSA and its effect is the strongest among all of the explanatory variables. The unemployment rate has a positive effect on default/90-days-delinquency. Moreover, negative equity, the negative equity dummy and original loan-to-value are all positively related to the default/90-days-delinquency decision. As expected, in most MSAs, the credit score has a strongly positive effect on the prepayment; comparatively, it has a strong negative impact on the default. When using the credit score only in the default risk and not in the prepayment risk, the effect of the credit score is still significantly negative, but the coefficients decrease slightly. Moreover, debt-to-income does not appear to affect prepayment; however, it has a positive relationship with the default/90-days-delinquency in most MSAs. A Wald test is constructed to test the equality of the coefficients among five MSAs and the results of this test support the argument that prepayment and default risks are heavily influenced by local characteristics.In earlier studies, the proportional hazards model becomes a popular method to analyze the single (prepayment or default) risk of mortgages. This model has been developed into a competing risks model and been widely used to analyze the prepayment and default risks simultaneously in later studies. However, the process of constructing the competing risks model is ambiguous. In Chapter 2, this study clearly presents the calculation process of this model based on the proportional hazards model using Sueyoshi’s method and then implements the model to analyze the termination risks of single-family mortgages in Phoenix.Ding, Tian, Yu and Guo (2012) construct a new model based on a class of transformation survival models to analyze the risk of bankruptcy and they argue that that the proportional hazards model is not the best model to analyze this risk. Therefore, a question is raised by this argument: whether the proportional hazards model is the best model to analyze the default/prepayment risk of single-family mortgages? A new competing risks model based on a class of discrete transformation survival models is constructed in Chapter 2 and it is used to analyze the termination risks of the single-family mortgages in Phoenix. The model is controlled by the transformation parameters ???? (for the prepayment risk) and ???? (for the default risk). When ????=0 and ????=0, it is the competing risks model based on proportional hazards, and when ????>0and ????>0, its framework is changed according to the value of ???? and ????.The results show that the proportional hazards framework is the best model to estimate the prepayment risk, but it is not the best model to estimate the default/90-days-delinquency risk. The results of both models support the important arguments made in Chapter 1. Comparing the coefficients estimated by three competing risks models, the coefficients estimated by the model based on the Sueyoshi proportional hazards are insignificantly distinguishable from those estimated by the model based on the multinomial logit. Moreover, the coefficients estimated by the model based on a class of transformation survival models are significantly different from those estimated by the other two models.Unobserved heterogeneity is an important component that should be considered in the modeling process, even though it is not commonly involved in the analysis of the termination risks of the mortgages. In Chapter 3, this study uses latent classes to control unobserved heterogeneity of two different groups of borrowers and constructs three competing risks models based on the multinomial logit, the proportional hazards model and a class of transformation survival models. The models allow the coefficients of the explanatory variables to be different between two groups of borrowers by keeping the baseline the same (the coefficients of the loan age splines are the same between two groups of borrowers). The models are used to analyze the competing risks of prepayment and default/90-days-delinquency of the single-family mortgages in Phoenix and the estimated average conditional hazard for prepayment, default and 90-days-delinquency are compared with those estimated by models that do not control for unobserved heterogeneity. The results show that when the loan age is between 120 and 165 months, models that do not control for unobserved heterogeneity highly overpredict the prepayment hazard. In the average conditional default and 90-days-delinquency hazard, models that do not control for unobserved heterogeneity overpredict the average conditional hazard compared with models that control for unobserved heterogeneity when the loan age is between around 49 and 94 months.Another question answered in this study is that if housing prices did not boom and bust since 2004, what would the average conditional default hazard and the average conditional 90-days-delinquency hazard be? This paper constructs a simulation process by assuming that the housing price remains the same since September 2004 and compares the simulated conditional hazards with those estimated based on the real trend of the housing price. The results show that, in the case when the housing price changes across time, the average conditional hazard dramatically increases from around age month 11 and reaches the maximum hazard at around age month 54, and then sharply decreases until around age month 93. This dramatic change of the average conditional hazard disappears in the case when the housing price is assumed to be unchanged after September 2004. The simulated average conditional hazard slowly increases from age month 1 up to age month 169 with an average rate of increase of 3.72 percent for default hazard and 1.80 percent for 90-days-delinquency hazard. The average difference of the conditional hazard is approximately 0.21 percent between the two cases."

Faking ADHD is especially easy when the diagnosis is based on self-report, symptoms-only rating scales.  Diagnostic accuracy improves with the assessment of symptoms, impairment, and symptom validity, but this type of comprehensive self-report measure is currently not available.  The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a newly constructed Multidimensional ADHD Rating Scale (MARS) comprised of ADHD symptom, functional impairment, and symptom validity indexes.  The MARS self-report items were completed by three groups of college-aged students.  Participants with ADHD (n=39) and non-ADHD controls (n=62) completed the MARS honestly.  A group of non-ADHD participants (n=56) were instructed to malinger ADHD.  Results indicated that malingerers reported more symptoms and impairment than ADHD participants, and both groups reported more symptoms and impairment than controls.  The symptom validity index was able to differentiate malingerers from ADHD participants with high sensitivity and specificity. These preliminary results suggest that measures that combine symptoms, impairment, and symptom validity could be useful additions to ADHD rating scales."

etd_394,The Decision to Pursue the Principalship: Perspectives of Certified Administrators in Upstate Central New York,Teaching and Leadership,"Annual Professional Performance Review, Attractants, Deterrents, Leadership, Management, Principal Role","This qualitative research study sought to uncover the attractants and deterrents of educational administrative positions in Upstate Central New York (CNY) public schools by exploring the perspectives of both practicing principals and those that are certified but not currently employed in an administrative position. The study posed three research questions. First, how do educators who are certified as administrators in Upstate Central New York describe experiences that have influenced them to pursue or not pursue the principalship? Second, what do certified administrators perceive as the attractants and deterrents to the principalship in Upstate Central New York and which of these are factors in their decision to apply for and accept principalships? Finally, how have the attractants and deterrents to the principalship changed in the recent years covered by this study? Participants in the study included certified educational administrators that are both practicing principals as well as those that have not yet assumed an administrative position.  Purposeful and snowball sampling techniques were utilized to include participants from rural, urban, and suburban settings in CNY. Two separate cohorts, interviewed five years apart, provided insight into the changing landscape of the principalship. Findings addressing the research questions are based on five themes that emerged during the study: Accountability, Nature of the Job, Terms and Conditions of Employment, Climate, and Personal Factors. The longitudinal nature of this study revealed the emergence of the Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) requirements as a recent major factor impacting the decision of certified administrators to seek, accept, and remain in the principalship in New York State. The conclusions of this study have potential significance to assist decision makers of CNY public schools to better understand and attract high quality candidates from the available candidate pool. Recommendations and implications are enumerated and proposed for educational constituent groups in New York State including Superintendents and Boards of Education,  the New York State Education Department and State Government, Public and Private Universities with preparation programs in Educational Leadership, Professional Associations (SAANYS, NYSSBA, NYSCSS), and the Central New York School Study Council. School districts need to provide a rich professional fulfilling work environment to both attract and retain principals. As the principal is the key to promoting academic excellence, a supportive work environment that accentuates the attractants and minimizes the deterrents will facilitate the provision of a high quality, equitable education to all children throughout the diverse communities of CNY."
rel_etd_86,The Deconstruction of Hell: A History of the Resignatio ad Infernum Tradition,Religion,"Cixous, Dostoevsky, hell, love, Marguerite Porete, parrhesia","This dissertation is an historical examination of a medieval mystical tradition known as the resignatio ad infernum (willingness to be damned), which expresses a preference to be damned to hell out of love and solidarity for those the church had deemed lost.The work has six chapters and a conclusion and is divided into two parts. In the introduction to part one, I frame the discussion of the resignatio ad infernum in terms of contemporary trauma theory and Foucault's late lectures on the concept of parrhesia. In the first two chapters, I explore the scriptural antecedents to the tradition (ch. 1), along with post-biblical 'tours of hell' (ch. 2).In the third and last chapter of Part One, I read Augustine's doctrine of hell, which becomes the normative one, as deeply embedded in his political battle with the dissident Christians known to us as the Donatists. His hell is seen as an attempt to indemnify both God and the godly self from the trauma/hell of this life.This sets the stage for the second part of the dissertation, in which the flowering of the resignatio ad infernum tradition is seen as a theo-political gesture of resistance to the theodicy of hell developed in the Augustinian context. Part Two begins with an introduction devoted to Foucault's early lectures on governmentality and the medieval practices of what he calls 'counter-conduct'. Chapter four is a detailed look at the flowering of the resignatio ad infernum tradition in the 13th century beginning with Hadewijch of Brabant. Chapter five looks at two more thirteenth-century mystics, Jacopone da Todi and Marguerite Porete, and analyzes their deployment of the resignatio themes as exemplifications of Foucauldian 'counter-conduct'. Chapter five concludes with a brief discussion of the subsequent domestication of the resignatio tradition within Catholic and Lutheran thought. Chapter six shows the resignatio tradition returning, via Dostoevsky, to the postmodern scene through the work of Levinas, Derrida, and especially Hélène Cixous. Finally, in a concluding chapter, I argue that this tradition, though residing until the twentieth century primarily in a theological register, has much in common with two political theorists influenced by Levinas and Foucault, Judith Butler and William Connolly."
etd_423,The Design of Allosterically Regulated Protein Catalysts,Chemistry,"environmentally friendly chemistry, enzyme catalysis, enzyme promiscuity, green chemistry, minimalist approach, protein engineering","Producing novel catalytic function in proteins has intrinsic practical utility and provides a further understanding of enzymatic processes found in nature.  Current state of the art computationally heavy methods have created enzymes with novel function, but are complex to utilize. However, minimalist approaches to create enzymes offer a more streamlined method that, when combined with several rounds of directed evolution can produce enzymes for various chemical reactions with comparable efficiency.An enzyme was created through a minimalist approach to catalyze a benchmark reaction. This enzyme was created through introducing a single active amino acid residue and the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency was improved through several rounds of directed evolution 220 fold. Furthermore, the ability of the enzyme and its improved derivatives to catalyze a similar ring opening reaction has been characterized. This gives knowledge as to how enzymes designed by minimalist approaches can be sufficient starting points for similar chemical reactions as compared to enzymes designed by other approaches.Additionally, minimalist approach was applied to create a retro-aldolase. Through strategic placement of a single active amino acid residue, a 15,000-fold increase in the second order rate constant was observed. This enzyme can be improved by completing rounds of directed evolution through screening of crude bacterial cell lysates. This demonstrates that the minimalist approach can be applied to chemical reactions which proceed by various mechanisms. All of the enzymes described above are allosterically regulated by calcium.More recently, efforts are underway to engineer a manmade metalloprotein scaffold to catalyze oxidation reactions. A protein was constructed as a mimic of natural occurring enzymes and consists of a dimetal coordination sphere. The scaffold was redesigned to comprise of a single mononuclear metal center in order to catalyze oxidation reactions. This gives more coordination sites to accommodate a substrate and an oxidant. Finally, these enzymes designed by minimalist approaches act as catalytically amplified metal sensors, they can be utilized to sense various metals in biological processes and they provide means to more environmentally sustainable chemistry."
scied_etd_25,"The design, enactment, and impact of an inquiry-based undergraduate astronomy laboratory learning environment",Science Teaching,"astronomy, laboratory, teaching assistants","This study investigated the design, enactment, and impact of an undergraduate, inquiry-based astronomy laboratory learning environment. The professor, Richard, adopted laboratory materials from the Center for Astronomy and Physics Education Research [CAPER] which were described by the group as inquiry-based. Students worked through these laboratory materials under the supervision of teaching assistants [TAs], and Richard led weekly TA meetings to monitor and instruct the TAs on his expectations. This study suggests that Richard was unsure of laboratory materials' learning goals and had received limited guidance on how to use and implement CAPER's materials. TAs also received limited guidance on how to interact with their students while they worked through the laboratory materials. TAs gave introductions during laboratory sessions that were similar to Richard's introductions given during weekly TA meetings. Data from this study suggests that most students were able to easily complete the laboratory materials without the assistance of their TA. When students did ask questions, questions were focused on obtaining the correct answer which TAs normally supplied though direct responses or questioning. This laboratory learning environment was found to have no impact on students' understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry, as measured by VOSI, which contradicts previous research findings associated with the materials. I suggest that professors should be cautious when adopting curriculum materials. Curriculum designers should provide information related to the design of their materials, the learning goals of those materials, sample student responses, and effective implementation strategies"

It investigates how applications of critical social theory occlude the category of experience either deliberately or through methodological slight. Utopia addresses this problematic of representing the existential dimension of social life through its particular formulation of social contradiction. Analyzing Utopia's own representational situation within modernity affords scholars in religion a means to consider their investments in and desires for representing society as a totality that creates the conditions for and anticipates resolutions to these contradictions.

""Informal"" statistical inference has been studied as a means to introduce inferential reasoning well before and without the formalities of formal statistical inference. This mixed methods study investigated the development of introductory statistics students' informal inferential reasoning and its relationship to their formal inferential reasoning. A pre/posttest was administered to 136 students enrolled in introductory statistics classes taught in their secondary schools. Four task-based interviews were also conducted with seven pairs of those students.With probabilistic reasoning essential for formal statistical inference, students' informal inferential reasoning related to sampling and estimating probabilities did improve significantly. Additionally, the strong informal inferential reasoners, those strong at the beginning and remaining so at the end of the study, and the 14 students who took part in the task-based interviews demonstrated strong formal inferential reasoning at the end of their course. However, when the interviewees drew informal inferences based on a sampling distribution, the majority of them sought to reduce variability by taking several samples. This study provided insight into why students were not using the probabilities associated with the normality of the sampling distribution when drawing an informal inference and how this then impacted their formal inferential reasoning. Implications for practice and suggestions for further research are included."

The study design involved questionnaires consisting of close-ended and open-ended questions about local foods. Questions regarding local food perceptions, motivations, customer inquiries, training, source, and barriers to local foods were asked of the wait staff. Managers and/or chefs were asked questions regarding the source and amount of their ingredients, training methods, and barriers to local foods.Participants: The participants were 27 managers, chefs, or wait staff from eight restaurants in central New York restaurants that claim to explicitly use local foods on their menus or promote them in their advertisements. The study focuses on restaurants promoting local foods on their menus or in advertisements. Four participants answered survey questions through face-to-face interviews. The remaining 23 participants completed a paper version of the questionnaire.Results: The most frequently mentioned motivators for serving local food on the menu included supporting the local economy (83%) and reducing environmental impact (59%). Wait staff reported most commonly asked customer questions related to the origin menu items. Training on local foods ranged from no training to taste testing dishes to bus trips to local farms. The most wait staff (63%) indicated that “most of the menu items” contain local ingredients, yet most managers or chefs (75%) stated that half of their ingredients or less came from local sources. More than half (61%) of wait staff indicated feeling “very confident” in addressing customers’ questions about local food. Four wait staff respondents (29%) were accurate in identifying the sources of the restaurant’s ingredients. No significance was found between accuracy and confidence level in addressing questions about local foods. The greatest barrier to sourcing local food was the inconsistent supply of local foods, which was reported by 100% of chefs and 65% of wait staff.Conclusions: Local food promoting restaurants have the potential to be innovators in the local food movement through communicating local food benefits and messages via the wait staff. Increased adoption of local food consumption may potentially enhance the development of a more sustainable food system. Restaurant wait staff may have a false sense of confidence in addressing customer questions about local foods. This suggests that more training on local foods should be emphasized in the restaurant. The results of this research point to a need for further studies to investigate how the customer interprets information provided by the wait staff about local foods. Further, additional studies should look into the true source of ingredients on LFPR menus."
etd_559,THE DYNAMICS OF CONFLICT: TRANSFORMING NORTHERN IRELAND,Political Science,"Conflict Transformation, Dual-Wing Resistance Oganizations, IRA, Levels of Analysis, Northern Ireland, Process Tracing","The main goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the process of conflict transformation. More specifically, I wish to examine what are the circumstances that push Dual Wing Resistance Organizations (DWRO), and particularly, the Irish Provisional Republican Movement to behave in one of four different ways: convergent towards violence, convergence towards cooperation, divergence and confusion.My main argument is that in order to understand conflict transformation processes and what pushes an organization to behave in a particular way one must look into the interaction between factors at three levels of analysis: the context, organizational dynamics and leadership. Beyond this claim, my analysis focuses on answering a couple of other questions as well: Can studying a process and not just snap-shots in time lead to better understanding of organizational decisions? Can any one particular factor be responsible for every type of behavior? Can any one factor be relevant in the same way in all types of cases? Are some factors more relevant in leading to some types of behaviors over others? Can any one level of analysis explain all types of behaviors? and lastly, what is the role of leaders in conflict transformation processes? particularly, what role did Adams play in the process, what type of a leader was he and did he change over time?To answer my questions, I process traced the Northern Ireland conflict from the end of 1983, when Gerry Adams became the president of Sinn Féin and until the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in May 1998. I divided my timeline into 24 cases, ten cases of convergence towards cooperation, three cases of convergence towards violence, eight cases of divergence and three cases of confusion. For each case, I examined the four-months period leading up to the studied behavior.I looked for actions by the British (government, military, court and police), the Irish (government, military, court and police), Unionists (political parties, as well as loyalist paramilitaries), intermediaries, promoters of peace and spoilers. I also looked into the potential role elections and agreements had to play. I then looked into the state of organizational dynamics in the period leading to each of my cases, what was going on within the organization, was there preference divergence between leadership and rank and file? Was there preference divergence between the two wings? Was there preference divergence between leaders? At that point I looked more closely into the workings of Adams – was he being sensitive to the context? Was he pushing his own agenda forward and bringing the organization with him or was he letting the organizational constraints dictate his behavior?This process helped me in answering my questions, but also to understand whether factors from the different levels of analysis interacted with each other in leading to particular behaviors over others. I found that it is indeed illuminating to look into a process as a whole. Studying single-snap shots of behaviors can never tell the entire story. Looking into particular cases without considering past interactions between the various actors relevant in the conflict environment may lead to misunderstandings. I also found that the organizational decision to behave in one way or another is determined by the interaction of factors from the various levels.However, I also found that even the same type of organizational behavior can be driven by different organizational goals. Meaning, sometimes the organization chooses to diverge out of necessity and fear of splintering, whereas in other times it is a tactical decision. In any case, the choice is not determined by the organizational dynamics alone, but by the context and the leadership as well. Meaning, both divergence and convergence can be driven by an organizational need to survive, but it is the context and the leadership that will determine which of the two behaviors will be adopted.  The other side of the coin is that the same organizational motivation can lead to different behaviors, depending on the context and the leadership.When it comes to the particular contextual factors, I found that the British were relevant in all of the cases studied. Additionally, the British played a significant role in pushing the organization towards convergence, whereas the Unionists were found to be much more active during times of divergence, but not necessarily relevant for organizational decision making per se. The context as a whole mostly helped in explaining the choice between violence and cooperation. The particular factors within the context level were far less straight-forward in their effect. All factors were found to have both positive and negative effects. Promoters of peace were mostly acting in positive ways, but even they had some actions that were seen as negative from the Republican Movement’s point of view. The Irish Republic was mostly negative in cases of divergence and only negative in cases of convergence towards violence and elections were found to be significant more in times of divergence than in time of convergence. When the context could not explain particular behaviors, organizational dynamics and leadership helped filling in the gap.Lastly I found Gerry Adams to be a strategic leader that was hugely central in the progress of the conflict transformation process, due to his unique position within the organization, his leadership skills, his sensitivity to information, his long-windedness, his political skills and his charisma. He may not have been central in every organizational decision that was taken, and he may have been pulled by his own organization towards positions that were contrary to his agenda, but he nonetheless was central for the transformation of the movement from violence to cooperation and for the conflict transformation process as a whole."
etd_60,The Dynamics of Violent Escalation and De-escalation: Explaining Change in Islamist Strategies in Egypt and Indonesia,Political Science,,"This study examines how change happens within Islamist organizations and what causal mechanisms underlie the adoption or abandonment of violent tactics. The project argues that ideological and tactical changes are determined by the interaction of five factors: founding principles, the extent to which government domestic and foreign policies are convergent with the vision of the group, regime policies towards the organization, public norms of resistance and organizational dynamics.The analysis relies on process-tracing and counterfactual analysis to examine four case studies from Egypt and Indonesia: the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Gama'a Al-Islamiyyah, the Darul Islam, and al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah. The empirical investigation finds that the process of violent escalation is driven by the logic of grievances. Government repression, low policy convergence and salient threats to the Muslim community lead to escalating grievances. These grievances are aggravated by the pervasiveness of violent norms of resistance and by intra-organizational competition over authority. In such a context, any perceived external aggression can serve as a catalyst for violent escalation. There is a powerful slippery slope of politicization and militarization that can lead to the acceptance and adoption of violent tactics, as well as to a shift from foreign targets to domestic political actors and ultimately civilians. Revenge and fear, as well as a sense of mistrust of the government and betrayal by the national leadership are powerful causal mechanisms of violent escalation.De-escalation primarily follows the logic of disillusionment. An organizational crisis and widespread public condemnation of the group can lead to a re-evaluation of the cost of violence, and a re-thinking of the vision as a whole, which prompts the group to de-escalate its tactics. When groups have several exit options away from violence and public condemnation is not as acute, organizations may metamorphose into different entities that temporarily prioritize non-violent activism, without categorically rejecting violence as a possibility in the future."
etd_603,The Economy of Preventive Maintenance of Concrete Bridges Due to Corrosion,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"chloride diffusion, Concrete bridges, corrosion, diffusion coefficient, preventive maintenance","The current practice for physical evaluation and delayed maintenance of deteriorated concrete bridge is fundamentally wrong. This research presents a new approach for the evaluation of the condition states of steel reinforced concrete bridge members, which is based on their chemical conditions instead of the physical deficiencies such as cracks and delamination. Using the proposed chemical based inspection approach, a more effective and economic preventive maintenance plan could be achieved. The available non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods and preventive maintenance measure are identified. Since the chloride induced corrosion is the major factor that dictates the service life of the steel reinforced bridge element, a refined equation for estimation of the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions into concrete is proposed.A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model that accounts for time-dependent and temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient was developed and verified against experimental data produced by several researchers. The results of the numerical analysis showed good agreement with experimental data. After validation against experimental data, the FEA model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the preventive maintenance measures, such as surface sealers and overlays. The chloride profiles derived from the FEA model was then used as an indicator to select appropriate preventive maintenance measures at the right time based on the chloride concentration at the surface of the steel. A simplified concrete bridge deck element is selected to compare the life-cycle cost of a bridge deck with different concrete mix design and different maintenance strategies under various exposure conditions.For cost-effective management of concrete highway bridges, the following measures should be taken, depending on the exposure conditions:1.	For severe exposure conditions, such as coastal area or cold regions that require a large amount of deicing salt, carbon steel reinforced bridge decks have a short service life. Therefore, a well-planned preventive maintenance strategy needs to be implemented in order to postpone or eliminate the needs of major rehabilitation and replacement. In such case, the use of stainless steel could be the most economical solution for the long run. In addition, the use of integrated overlay made of high performance concrete or cathodic protection systems may reduce the life-cycle cost based on a 75-year expected service life.2.	For moderate exposures, the use of overlays and surface sealers has been deemed cost-effective. However, the life-cycle cost is very sensitive for sealer application since it needs to be reapplied frequently. Thus, the effectiveness of the sealer should be closely monitored by the Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods.3.	For mild exposures, the corrosion may not be the most critical deterioration mechanism for the bridge deck element. The riding surface of the bridge deck needs to be replaced periodically due to other deterioration mechanisms such as erosion, fatigue cracks, etc.In conclusion, this research shows that it is not only economical, but also necessary to allocate more funds to perform in-depth, chemical oriented non-destructive tests and active preventive maintenance."

In a design teams approach, participants work in collaborative teams to design solutions to solve real-world problems. This quasi-experimental study explored the efficacy of an educational technology course implemented with a design teams approach compared to the same course that utilized a standard instructional approach. The sample included 53 preservice teachers from one university majoring in either Early Childhood Inclusive or Elementary Inclusive Education. Preservice teachers in the treatment condition worked in design teams to plan technology integrated lessons to solve authentic instructional problems. In the comparison condition, preservice teachers completed instructor-designed assignments in class and planned a technology integrated lesson independently. In comparing the participating preservice teachers' attitudes toward technology, skills, and TPACK, it was found that there were significant differences between the two groups on TPACK when measured with evidence from lesson plans. There were no significant differences when survey data on attitudes toward technology, technology skills, and TPACK were compared; further exploration indicated that both groups significantly improved on these measures over the course of the semester. These results suggested that the design teams approach was appropriate for use in preservice teacher technology education, but additional research is necessary to determine in which contexts and with what specific learning outcomes it is most effective."
etd_84,The Effect of Maternal Separation and Postnatal Oxytocin Administration on Social Recognition in Adolescent Female Mice,Psychology,"Adolescent mice, Female, Maternal Separation, Oxytocin, Social Recognition","A vast body of literature indicates that exposing rodents to maternal separation during infancy results in long - term developmental changes in physiological, behavioral, and psychological domains.  Because several previous studies have indicated that maternal separation may be detrimental to the processing and discrimination of social cues, the primary aim of this dissertation was to determine whether separating female infant mouse pups from their mother, but not siblings, for 3 hrs daily, during the first two weeks of life, influences social recognition during adolescence (Experiment 1).  This dissertation also sought to evaluate whether postnatal administration of the oxytocin would influence social recognition or the acquisition of social odor preferences in adolescent control and maternally separated female mice (Experiment 2).  The results of Experiment 1 showed that, in contrast to control subjects, maternally separated females showed diminished habituation to repeated presentations of a familiar conspecific and significant impairments in the ability to discriminate between a previously encountered and novel mouse during the dishabituation session.  In Experiment 2, postnatal oxytocin injections did not substantially affect the expression of either social recognition behavior or social odor preferences by control-reared females during adolescence.  By contrast, postnatal oxytocin administration improved the acquisition of social odor preferences, but did not recover social recognition behavior in MS females.  The results of this dissertation suggest that altering the early social environment by means of the maternal separation procedure can disrupt the ability to recognize conspecific odor cues, which are fundamental components in establishing and maintaining social relationships later in life."

Collaborating with two teacher educators at Central University, I designed and implemented two multimedia case-based intervention lessons, one with prospective chemistry teachers and the other with prospective physics teachers. I determined the changes in self-efficacy beliefs using a pretest and posttest with the Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (STEBI) for N=41 participants. I also collected data using a worksheet during the intervention lesson. When the prospective teachers went for their field practice, I sampled eight of them for in depth interviews to determine what they drew on from the intervention lesson during their classroom teaching.I used Roth McDuffie’s et al. (2014) framing to categorize the comments that the prospective teachers made on the worksheet into the four lenses of teacher, students, task or power and participation. I used paired sample t-test to determine the changes in self-efficacy beliefs and then developed profiles of the prospective teachers from the in depth interviews.The results revealed that prospective teachers paid more attention to the actions of the teacher and paid less attention to students’ activities. Their attention to the task was predominantly about the cognitive level of the task and almost always focused on the errors they noted. The prospective teacher noticing using the power and participation lens was not clearly delineable from the teacher lens, because most instructional activities that led to more participation were teacher actions.Science teaching efficacy beliefs has two constructs: personal science teaching efficacy (PSTE) and science teaching outcome expectancy (STOE). The PSTE scores were very high at 4.46 out of five on the pretest, and 4.41 on posttest. There was a decrease in the mean scores, but the change was not significant. There was a statistically significant increase in STOE (M=1.78, SD=5.8 t(40)=2.802 p=0.008) and an overall increase in the self-efficacy beliefs. The teacher profiles showed that prospective teachers drew from specific examples from the multimedia cases as well as learned from a gestalt interpretation of the teaching and learning activities in the clips that were shown.From these results, I discuss how prospective science teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs are altered in the process of watching multimedia cases. Their beliefs about knowledge start to change from absolute ownership to shared and co-constructed knowledge in class, as seen in the decrease in the personal teaching outcome expectancy (PSTE) and an increase in noticing of students’ role in learning."
idde_etd_57,The Effect of Participation in Syracuse University Project Advance and Advanced Placement on Persistence and Performance at a Four-Year Private University,"Instructional Design, Development and Evaluation","Concurrent enrollment, Dual credit, Project Advance, Student performance, Student persistence","Concurrent enrollment programs (CEPs) are an important source of academic preparation for high school students. Along with Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate, CEPs allow students to challenge themselves in high school and prepare for the rigor of college. Many researchers and practitioners have claimed that, when high school students participate in such programs, they become more successful in college, having better retention rates and better grades. Based upon their knowledge about the many students who have participated in CEPs, Marshal and Andrews (2002) note that ""there is scarcity of research on dual credit aka concurrent enrollment programs."" The claims for the effectiveness of CEPs must be substantiated.Syracuse University's concurrent enrollment program, Project Advance (PA), was implemented in 1972 at the request of six local Syracuse high schools. The current study is an empirical investigation of the effects of student participation in Syracuse University Project Advance (SUPA) and/or Advanced Placement (AP) on desired student outcomes such as persistence and performance, determined as follows:1. Persistence:a. Short-term persistencei. Student dropout in the first year of college;ii. Student dropout in the second year of collegeb. Long-term persistencei. Student graduation in four yearsii. Student graduation in six years2. Performance:a. College readinessi. Student performance in subsequent courses on the main Syracuse University campus.b. College performancei. First year cumulative grade point average (freshman GPA)ii. Fourth year cumulative grade point average (degree GPA)The sample consists of Syracuse University undergraduates (23,398) from fall 1997 to fall 2008, both inclusive. Students who participated in SUPA and AP in high school are tracked by college enrollment and completion, and then compared with their peers of similar demographics and achievement who had not taken such courses. This study attempts to evaluate the effect of both AP and SUPA on college persistence and performance, with and without controlling for confounding variables such as demographic, financial need, and precollege entry student characteristics. The researcher also examined other significant determinants of persistence and whether the effects varied by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The effects were examined using statistical tests for differences in means as well as multiple regression analysis. The findings of this study were mixed. No cause and effect claims were made, as this is a correlational study. Regarding short-term persistence, the findings were in favor of both AP and SUPA. Regarding long-term persistence and performance (cumulative GPA for the first and fourth year), the findings were in favor of AP. When student performance in the subsequent course was examined, participation in SUPA was not significant in predicting the grade in the subject specific postcourse grade. The findings also suggest grade inflation in six out of the eight SU courses offered through PA. However, the findings for both math and writing were illuminating.

ecn_etd_99,The Effect of Public Policy on Health Service Providers,Economics,,"Chapter 1Low-income, publicly insured admissions historically cost more to treat than the average patient. To ensure that hospitals are reimbursed an adequate amount for care of indigent populations, Medicare reimburses hospitals an additional percentage amount according to federally set financial schedule. The reimbursement cutoff is discrete: at fifteen percent of a disproportionate patient percentage, a hospital is reimbursed an extra 2.5 percent of the standard prospective payment rate. I extend a simple model of hospital quality as a function of insurance reimbursement increases to determine that under certain circumstances there exists a positive relationship between quality and reimbursement. I use Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data to analyze hospital ratings around the fifteen percent disproportionate patient percentage cutoff and find that on average, hospital ratings increase by six percentage points. When a subsample of non-profit hospitals is analyzed, hospital ratings increase by an average of 6.5 percentage points, primarily driven by patient facility cleanliness and medical provider communication ratings.Chapter 2The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) created the Hospital Compare Program in 2003 to increase transparency between health care providers and consumers. Implemented in 2005, this transparency consists of hospitals' collecting and making publicly available a set of hospital quality score measures. The CMS induced participation by financially penalizing hospitals that did not publicly report a specific subset of these measures (called ""starter"" measures). Three years into the program, the penalty for non-reporting both the starter measures and other (""non-starter"") measures was increased. I use a difference-in-differences methodology to analyze the effect of the increased CMS penalty on the likelihood that a hospital publicly reported its starter and non-starter measure scores. I find that the penalty had an economically and statistically insignificant effect on the probability that a hospital publicly reported its starter scores but a statistically significant eight percent effect (p < 0.01) on whether it reported its non-starter scores. These findings are robust to a series of alternative empirical specifications.Chapter 3In 2006, Massachusetts passed a health care reform which required individuals to purchase health insurance and provided subsidized health insurance to the poor. The reform greatly increased the proportion of the state population that was insured. In this study we use a large data set of private health insurance claims to analyze the effect of the increase in the number of insured on physician reimbursement. We find that reimbursement for well-infant visits rose by approximately 4 percent during the reform implementation period, but the increase did not persist. Reimbursement for well-adult visits and appendectomies remained unchanged. Triple difference estimates using appendectomies (for which demand is extremely inelastic) as an additional control group show a 2 percent rise in well-infant visit reimbursement during the implementation period and no effect afterwards or on well-adult visit reimbursement. Estimates imply a temporary increase in the cost of health services with relatively elastic demand following a large scale insurance mandate, such as the Affordable Care Act."
etd_480,The Effect of Stress on Undergraduate College Students in Relation to Eating Out Behaviors and Weight Status,Nutrition Science and Dietetics,,"Objective: The aims of the current descriptive study were to determine if greater levels of perceived stress in college students relates to the frequency in which this population participates in eating out or ordering food for delivery and how this potential association influences weight status.Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted using an existing data set obtained from the Young Adults Eating and Active for Health study. Demographic questions, The Cohen 14-item Perceived Stress Scale, anthropometrics, the NCI Fruit and Vegetable Screener, and the Food Delivery Questionnaire were used to measure the main variables under examination. Non-parametric statistics, Chi-square T-tests, and ANOVA were used to analyze data. Data was analyzed using SPSS software and tested for a P value < 0.05 as statistically significant.Participants: The participants consisted of 973 students from 13 college campuses across the U.S. who had participated in the 15-month YEAH study. Of the sample population, 287 participants were male and 685 were female.Results: Female college students were shown to exhibit greater levels of perceived stress than males (23.96±7.75 versus 21.74±7.54; t (932) = -4.02, p =0.00). Male participants demonstrated more frequent ordering of food delivery behavior than females (U = 76213.0, p = 0.005) but no association was found between levels of stress compared to eating out frequency, the rate of food delivered to a participant’s residence, or to BMI status.  Females showed an association for using websites such as campusfood.com more frequently when very high levels of stress were experienced (?2 (12) = 22.2, p = 0.035).Conclusion: The study did not present conclusive results but trends suggest at high levels of stress certain health related consumption behaviors may be influenced in a negative manner. The study provides a foundation for future research on stress and its potential influence on unhealthy eating out behaviors within the collegiate population."
etd_753,The Effect of the HOPE Scholarship Program on Interstate Migration,Social Sciences,"ArcGIS, College Tuition, HOPE Scholarship, Interstate Migration","The HOPE scholarship program, created by the state of Georgia in 1993, is the first large scale, merit-based higher educational scholarship program in the United States. In this research, I use border analysis and difference-in-differences estimates to test the hypothesis that the HOPE scholarship program attracts interstate education migration from Georgia’s neighboring states. My results support my hypothesis. I find that border areas in Georgia attract high school seniors from the adjacent areas in border states that do not have the HOPE scholarship program. In addition, I use the IPUMS dataset to provide further analysis to the effect of the HOPE scholarship program on interstate migration for entire states rather than for border areas. I find that for a family with high school children, Georgia is the most popular destination state in the inter-state migration within the southeastern area in the period of 1995-2000, because the HOPE scholarship reduces tuition in Georgia significantly."
etd_107,The Effects of Active Flow Control on High-Speed Jet Flow Physics and Noise,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Active Flow Control, Aeroacoustics, Jet Noise, Particle Image Velocimetry, Reduced-Order Modeling, Turbulence","The work to be presented focuses on the noise generation of a fully turbulent, compressible jet flow within a large scale anechoic chamber. The investigations are aimed at understanding the complex nature of the jet flow field in an effort to reduce the far-field noise through active flow control and novel reduced-order modeling. The flow field of a highly subsonic, axisymmetric jet with a nozzle diameter of two inches (50.8 mm), is probed through the implementation of two-component particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the streamwise plane, along the jet's centerline. These measurements are coupled with simultaneously sampled near and far-field pressure measurements, in an effort to understand the relationship between the complex flow field in the near region of the jet and large pressure fluctuation in the far-field, responsible for the noise. In order to reduce these large pressure fluctuations in the acoustic field, it is imperative to first understand the interaction of structures in the flow field and evaluate how this relates to the propagation of acoustic signatures to the far-field.We seek to establish a low-dimensional representation of the nonlinear, turbulent flow field through the implementation of reduced-order modeling in the form of proper orthogonal decomposition. In the first set of experiments conducted, active flow control is employed in the form of synthetic jet actuation at the nozzle lip, based on previous investigations. The effects of the flow control are observed using large-window PIV and far-field pressure measurements. The results suggest that an order epsilon input elicits an order one response, with both open and closed-loop flow control. While no noise reductions are seen in the far-field as compared to the uncontrolled jet, control authority over the jet is observed. The flow control greatly enhances mixing, thus reducing the length of the potential core and causing shear layer expansion. The second set of experiments involves the implementation of a time-resolved PIV system to effectively capture the temporal evolution of the flow physics in the streamwise plane. Low-dimensional velocity modes are directly correlated to low-dimensional acoustic modes in the far-field, using the observable inferred decomposition. Preliminary findings suggest that a small subset of low-dimensional velocity modes greatly contribute to the far-field acoustics. The spatiotemporal nature of these ""loud"" modes are investigated in the context of potential noise-producing events. It has been found that for the Mach 0.6 uncontrolled jet, focusing on the region near the collapse of the potential core, modes 6 and 14 appear to be the loud modes, contributing significantly to the far-field noise. Further exploration of mode 6 reveals a unique interaction of structures at very specific instances in time. Thus, it is concluded that from a low-dimensional viewpoint, we have identified the deterministic spatial structures in the velocity that most highly contributes to the noise in the far-field. It is possible from this analysis to begin to identify noise-producing events and examine these interactions in both time and space. Lastly, loud modes are identified for the controlled jet (using time-resolved PIV), however initial findings imply that the control greatly increases the complexity of the problem. Despite this fact, it is found that there may be similarities in the spatial structure of the loud modes for two different closed-loop control cases. In any case, through the use of active flow control and reduced-order modeling, preliminary steps have been taken to understand the sources of jet noise with respect to the flow physics, in an overall effort to efficiently achieve far-field noise reductions for practical applications."
etd_131,THE EFFECTS OF EXTENDED TIME ON READING COMPREHENSION PERFORMANCE FOR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE COLLEGE STUDENTS: IS THERE A NEED FOR ACCOMMODATIONS?,Psychology,"college, English language learners, extended time, test accommodations","American colleges and universities are enrolling an increasing number of students for whom English is a second language (ESL). These students face literacy challenges that may impact their academic performance as well as create disadvantages on tests, particularly reading intensive tests under time constraints. This study examined the effects of extended time as a test accommodation on a timed reading comprehension test for ESL students compared to non-ESL peers under standard time, time and one half, and double time conditions. Results revealed that under standard time conditions ESL students with low Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) in English access significantly fewer test items and answer significantly fewer items correctly than non-ESL peers. ESL students with high CALP levels have access to the same amount of the test as non-ESL peers and have comparable levels of accuracy. All three groups improved reading comprehension performance under extended time conditions, especially those with higher levels of English language proficiency. Low proficiency students are able to surpass the performance of non-ESL peers at standard time when allotted 50% to 100% extra time. These results suggest extended time, in allocations less than 50%, may be appropriate for some ESL students."
etd_618,The Effects of Genetic and Environmental Variation on Growth and Flowering,Biology,"Evolution, Heritability, Life history, Mimulus, Phenotypic plasticity, Quantitative genetics","The ability to respond to seasonal cues, including changes in daylength and temperature, can be vital for sessile organisms. One of the mechanisms plants use to deal with seasonal variation is adjusting their allocation to vegetative growth and reproduction, and the timing of the transition to flowering. To respond to selection and adapt to changing environments, populations must harbor genetic variation for these traits. This research addresses the following questions: (1) How much quantitative genetic variation for flowering time exists within a population? (2) Does photoperiod affect the timing of and allocation to growth and flowering? (3) Is their genetic variation and genetic correlations among and within photoperiod treatments for growth and flowering? To address these questions, we used a single population of the North American wildflower, Mimulus guttatus. We grew open-pollinated, field collected seed in a greenhouse to assess the standing genetic variation for growth and flowering traits. We then created full-sib families through assortative mating by flowering time. We grew seed in growth chambers in three photoperiod treatments (13, 14, and 15 hour days, corresponding to early spring through summer). We found substantial variation in flowering time across environments and maternal families. Additionally, we found that plants allocated their resources towards flowering and clonal growth differently according to daylength. Together, these results suggest that a single population can harbor substantial genetic variation, and that this variation may be the target of selection as climates shift and the onset of spring advances."

The purpose of this work is to analyze how taxation and infrastructure development aspects the current and future earnings using these policiesIn the first essay, I use a national infrastructure development program initiated in India in 2001 to construct new all-season roads (roads that can be used in all-weather especially monsoons) in villages that previously had only had dry-season roads (roads that are difficult to use in monsoons). In the second, I use a new tax on fringe benefits initiated in India in 2005, seeking evidence for the hypothesis that the difference in higher marginal tax rates on wages, relative to lower rates on fringe benefits, induces a reallocation of the total compensation package toward fringe benefits. In the final essay, which uses the same policy as that of first I am interested behind the economic motives of manipulation by the local community to obtain public good road in their locality."
etd_258,"The Effects of Local Government GAAP Regulation on Audit Market Concentration, Auditor Specialization, and Audit Fees",Accounting,"audit fees, auditor concentration, auditor specialization, reporting regulation","This study examines the effects of financial statement disclosure regulation on auditor market concentration and audit fees. I compare auditor industry concentration rates between municipalities reporting under the Single Audit Act in the state of Michigan, which requires all local governments to follow GAAP reporting, with concentration rates in Pennsylvania, which has unregulated reporting. Using both an interstate comparison as well as examining a policy change in the unregulated environment, I find evidence suggesting that auditor concentration is related to disclosure mandates. Through survey data, I then explore the impact of reporting regulation on audit fees. My findings suggest GAAP mandated disclosure is associated with an overall lower audit fee, evidence suggestive of economies of scale; however, specialist firms in the GAAP setting are able to differentiate themselves and earn a fee premium. The state with unregulated disclosure does not benefit from the same audit economies having a market containing higher overall audit fees as well as specialist auditors who may discount engagement fees where specialist pricing in both markets appears to depend on audit firm characteristics and market share. Collectively, my results provide evidence that disclosure regulation is associated with overall lower fees, but also results in greater concentration and specialist fee premiums."
etd_705,The effects of simulated inflammatory conditions on the corrosion and fretting corrosion of CoCrMo alloy,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"biomaterials, CoCrMo alloy, corrosion, fretting corrosion, Inflammation, medical device","In vivo corrosion of CoCrMo alloy and its potential adverse effects on the body have been recognized as major concerns in recent years. While the underlying concepts of general and mechanically-assisted corrosion have been well documented, recent report of inflammatory cell-induced corrosion (ICIC) of CoCrMo alloy challenged traditional understanding of the relationship between biology and corrosion of hip implants. To better understand the role biology may play in the corrosion of CoCrMo-based implants, this study explored the mechanism of ICIC on CoCrMo alloy and investigated how simulated inflammatory (SI) conditions affected the electrochemistry, oxide film and fretting corrosion behavior of CoCrMo alloy.A range of SI solutions, based on phosphate buffered saline with H2O2, HCl, HClO and Fe3+ additions, were investigated. Results of electrochemistry tests (open circuit potential, polarization and electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy) indicated the corrosion susceptibility of CoCrMo alloy can be significantly increased by SI solutions, increasing the oxidizing power and decreasing the passivity of the oxide film. Physiologically possible potential of CoCrMo alloy has been found to be as positive as 0.9 V, a much higher level than previously thought. Inflammatory cell-based chemicals such as H2O2, HClO, acid and Fenton reaction (H2O2 and Fe3+) were able to facilitate the corrosion of CoCrMo alloy and demonstrated part of the mechanism of inflammatory cell induced corrosion. The effect of inflammatory species hydrogen peroxide and voltage on the passive oxide film of CoCrMo alloy was studied by Electrochemical Atomic Force Microscopy (ECAFM). The results showed that simulated inflammatory condition (H2O2) and potential significantly altered oxide film behavior (surface roughness, topography, corrosion resistance). Variation of surface roughness, corrosion resistance were related with potential and time-dependent oxide film topography.Fretting corrosion behavior of CoCrMo/CoCrMo alloy combinations was significantly affected by SI conditions and potential. Presence of Fenton reaction resulted in less stable oxide film and increased oxidizing ability of solution, altering the fretting corrosion behavior of CoCrMo alloy. Additionally, a fundamental study was conducted to investigate the effect of electrode area on the cathodic voltage excursion of metallic biomaterials due to fretting corrosion. This work linked the area-dependent impedance characteristics to the time dependent voltage changes observed during fretting corrosion. Results showed that voltage shifts decreased as the exposed area increased and that this behavior was described well using the impedance-based theory model."
etd_473,The Elaboration Likelihood Model and Sport Video Gaming Effects on Gamers' Confidence and Desire to Play the Sport,Media Studies,,"Sport video gamers, as a huge population, have been studied descriptively in terms of the demographic and motivation for playing. Yet most studies paid attention to the relationship between gamers and the video game. A gap remains between sport video gaming and its effects on gamers’ attitude toward the exact sport they are playing in the game. Through the Elaboration Likelihood Model lens, the current study aimed to examine the effects of sport video gaming on gamers’ confidence in the sport as well as desire to play the sport. A pretest-posttest experimental design was conducted to investigate the causality between gaming and confidence and desire change. As the first application of ELM to sport video game, the current study incorporated the classic route shift pattern in persuasion to predict the improvement of gamers’ confidence and desire after game playing. This study proved that sport video gaming is effective in improving gamers’ attitude and behavior toward the specific sport. Specifically, this study justified that the time of playing, the performance in game, and the immersive degree of the game are influential to the improvement of gamers’ confidence in their ability and knowledge in golf as well as their desire to play golf in real life."
etd_444,The Epistemologies They Carry: An Investigation of Feminist Writing Assignments,Writing Program,"composition, feminism, feminist pedagogy, pedagogy, writing assignments, writing studies","This dissertation examines feminist writing assignments as one pedagogical site that influences students’ engagement and thinking. Drawing on rhetorical genre studies, feminist pedagogy, and composition scholarship on writing assignments, I argue that because writing assignments are genres that position students in particular subjectivities and carry implicit arguments and values, they are texts that should be revised for their theoretical and pedagogical features. The dissertation examines feminist writing assignments in the history of feminist composition scholarship, in a collection of 73 feminist-oriented writing assignments contributed by teachers who self-identified as enacting or being influenced by feminist pedagogy, and in one of my own feminist-informed writing assignments for an upper-division research writing course. Additionally, this study grounds the textual analysis of writing assignments through interviews with five of the participating teachers and an analysis of students’ reflections on my own research assignment. Through this extensive research, I found that, despite the theoretical commitment of feminist scholars and teachers, 38% of the assignments did not reflect feminist epistemologies. The teachers interviewed and the study of my own writing assignment both further suggest that translating pedagogy into assignments is a complex process, often understood as implicit. I offer this not as a critique of the feminist teachers’ pedagogies, as feminist pedagogy can be enacted in multiple ways, but to argue for more attention to the ways in which writing assignments visibly reflect pedagogies. The 62% of the assignments surveyed that did reflect feminist epistemologies highlight a variety of ways that assignment texts have the potential to be transformative—by offering students new understandings of their own roles and positions as writers and students, by complicating perspectives on the aims of the assignment or work of the class, by challenging students to view the world in new, slanted, or different perspectives, and by re-imagining what is possible in the world and in writing. The implications, which are examined in the conclusion, are that time and space for reflecting on pedagogy and writing assignment texts are useful for all teachers, whether through TA training programs, writing across the curriculum workshops, or other professional development events."
ecn_etd_91,The Essays on Unintended Consequences of Public Policy,Economics,"Property Value, Medical Malpractice","This dissertation studies three examples of public policies having consequences other than those intended when the policy was passed. They demonstrate that due to the interconnectedness of the economy, the intended effect of a policy is rarely the sole effect.The first essay examines the Texas Top 10% Plan. This policy guarantees automatic admission to their state university of choice for all high school seniors who graduate in the top 10% of their high school class. The essay shows evidence that households reacted strategically to this policy by moving to neighborhoods with lower-performing schools, increasing property values by 4.9 percent in those areas relative to areas with slightly better performing schools. The effect is strongest among schools that were the lowest performing before the change in policy; and weakens as the previous performance of the school district increases. These strategic reactions were influenced by the number of local schooling options available: areas that had fewer school choices showed no reaction to the Top 10% Plan.The second essay examines individual differences in the effects of medical malpractice tort reforms on pre-trial settlement speed and settlement amounts by age and likely settlement size. I focus on changes in the value of settlements for those trying to receive quick compensation - an understudied but very important population. Findings of note include that, unlike previously assumed, losses from tort reform among infants are small in an asset value sense and that the prime-aged working population that are the most negatively affected by tort reform, losing over 50 percent of the value of their mean settlements post reform. Maximum entropy quantile results show that the median expected settlement losses are often the most informative for policy evaluation and differ greatly from mean policy effects.The third essay uses the implementation of medical malpractice damage caps in several states, and a panel of private insurance claims to identify the effect of damage caps on the amount physicians charge to insurance companies and the amount that insurance companies reimburse physicians for medical services. In most cases the amount that physicians charge insurers does not change, but the amount that insurers reimburse physicians (which is the price seen in the market) decreases. I estimate price reductions as large as 14.5 percent for specific procedures."
mat_etd_68,The Eventual Vanishing of Self-Extensions,Mathematics,"Auslander-Reiten condition, Finitistic extension degree","In this thesis we examine modules that have eventually vanishing self-extensions with a view towards better understanding the Auslander-Reiten Condition.In the first part, we focus on modules over symmetric algebras using techniques from the representation theory of Artin algebras. More specifically, we examine how the shape of a component in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a symmetric algebra is related to the vanishing of self-extensions of the modules it contains. We obtain several restrictions on the possible shape of such a component containing a module with eventually vanishing self-extensions. For many algebras we are able to describe completely which components may contain a module with eventually vanishing self-extensions. We determine the degree in which these extensions must begin to vanish for every module in such a component. In particular, we identify new conditions which guarantee that a symmetric algebra satisfies a generalized version of the Auslander-Reiten Condition.In the second part, we consider all Noetherian rings. Motivated by the results in the first part of the thesis, we introduce the finitistic extension degree of a ring. We show that rings for which this invariant is finite satisfy the generalized version of the Auslander-Reiten Condition. These results extend recent results for rings satisfying another cohomological condition known as Auslander's Condition. We also investigate the relationship between the finiteness of the finitistic extension degree and Auslander's Condition."
etd_662,The evolution of extreme longevity in modern and fossil bivalves,Earth Sciences,"Bivalve, Evolution, Growth rate, Longevity","The factors involved in promoting long life are extremely intriguing from a human perspective.  In part by confronting our own mortality, we have a desire to understand why some organisms live for centuries and others only a matter of days or weeks.  What are the factors involved in promoting long life?  Not only are questions of lifespan significant from a human perspective, but they are also important from a paleontological one.  Most studies of evolution in the fossil record examine changes in the size and the shape of organisms through time.  Size and shape are in part a function of life history parameters like lifespan and growth rate, but so far little work has been done on either in the fossil record.  The shells of bivavled mollusks may provide an avenue to do just that.  Bivalves, much like trees, record their size at each year of life in their shells.  In other words, bivalve shells record not only lifespan, but also growth rate.  Being abundant both on the surface of the planet today, and in the geologic record, bivalves provide a vessel by which we can explore the factors that influence lifespan from two different perspectives.Mean body size in marine animals has increased more than 100 fold since the Cambrian.  Associated with this increase in body size is thought to be an overall shift in the metabolic rates of organisms as well.  Both factors bring attention to the key life history parameters of lifespan and growth rate.  Variation in these parameters is not well understood among modern taxa, much less in deep time.  Therefore, in Chapter 1, I present a global database of modern bivalve lifespans and growth rates in order to understand if latitudinal patterns exist in life history parameters in today’s oceans.  The database consists of over 1,000 entries from 297 species compiled by latitude.  The data indicate that 1) lifespan increases, and growth rate decreases, with latitude, both across the group as a whole and within well-sampled species, 2) growth rate, and hence metabolic rate, correlates inversely with lifespan, and 3) opposing trends in lifespan and growth combined with high variance  obviate any demonstrable pattern in body size with latitude.  These observations suggest that the proposed increase in metabolic activity and demonstrated increase in body size of organisms over the Phanerozoic, should be accompanied by a concomitant shift towards faster growth and/or shorter lifespan in marine bivalves.Clear latitudinal patterns in both lifespan and growth rate documented in Chapter 1 suggest a role for some environmental factors in promoting lifespan.  From a physiological perspective, cool temperatures and low/seasonal food availability are thought to promote long lifespan.  However, on the planet today, these two factors covary with latitude so separating their influence using modern organisms is difficult.  Fortunately, Earth’s fossil record offers a chance to tease apart these factors.  In Chapter 2, I turn to fossils from the Cretaceous and Eocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica.  During these times, Antarctica was situated in almost the same latitude as today, but temperatures resembled those of modern day mid-latitude environments (e.g, North Carolina).  In this unique setting, I found several co-occurring, unrelated, slow growing, long-lived species of bivalve.  Cool temperatures cannot explain these impressive longevities.  However, the high latitude setting would have resulted in extended periods of no sunlight and suggests that caloric restriction may be the driving factor in extreme longevity.Chapters 1 and 2 suggest that growth rate could be the factor through which long-life is selected in the evolution of extreme longevity.  Studies of growth rates of bivalves living at similar latitudes, under similar environmental conditions through long spans of geologic time, could help shed light on this question.  However, determining growth rates and lifespans of bivalves requires cross-sectioning individuals to reveal internal growth bands.  Such methods are time intensive and destructive sampling is often not permitted by museum curators.  An alternative method could be to determine age by simply measuring the size of individuals without cross-sectioning, but the nature of growth in bivalves (long-lived in particular) is such that a few millimeters of growth could equate to several decades and introduces a large degree of error.  In Chapter 3 then, I explore probabilistic methods for determining age from size in order to constrain population growth parameters without cutting large numbers of individuals.  From a small original sample size, I use the relationship between parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation to constrain the theoretical age/size distributions of a population of modern Spisula solidissima.  From these distributions, age can be assigned to an individual of any given size by drawing at random from the corresponding age/size distribution.  This method works extremely well in reconstructing population growth parameters in a modern bivalve and should be applicable to the fossil record as well.With the three chapters presented here, the foundation has been laid to study life history parameters in the fossil record.  Currently, life history data are missing from studies of body size and energetics of organisms through time.  The growth rate parameter k of the von Bertalanffy growth equation is the variable that will add a new dimension to our understanding of these fundamental patterns in the history of life on Earth.  The conclusions from Chapter 1 predict that the temporal trend in body size is driven by an increase in k through time.  The methods in Chapter 3 allow for study of k values through time in the fossil record.  Chapter 2 examines lifespans and growth rates of fossil bivalves and provides significant revelations into the factors that influence extreme longevity.  Though bivalves have been on the planet for over 500 million years, only a handful of studies have examined their life histories in the fossil record.  Besides those presented, other fascinating areas where life history information is needed include studies of survival at mass extinction events and the transitions associated with the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.  Incorporation of life history data into paleontological studies can and will provide fascinating insights in the evolution of life on Earth."
etd_123,"The Ghost of Olmsted: Nature, History & Urban Park Restoration in Boston's Emerald Necklace",Geography,"Boston, Ecological restoration, Frederick Law Olmsted, Historic preservation, Landscape, Urban parks","This dissertation examines the nineteenth-century production, the twentieth-century deterioration, and the twenty-first century restoration of Boston's Emerald Necklace, a 1,100-acre series of parks and parkways designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr. (1822-1903).  Originally built to meet a particular set of aesthetic landscape tastes, over time this park system changed to meet the recreational needs of visitors.  Throughout, the Emerald Necklace has served the interests of Boston's urban elite.  It is, therefore, an appropriate case for examining the historical relationship between power and landscape.  The parks of the Emerald Necklace did more than provide pretty views and space for play; they advanced the upper-class economic and cultural agendas of boosterism, real-estate speculation, and cultural assimilation.When we look at the nineteenth-century political economic context in which Olmsted worked and compare it to the late-twentieth/early-twenty-first century political economic context associated with park restoration, an intriguing historical-geographical parallelism becomes apparent.  In both moments, the Emerald Necklace operated as part a specific ""spatial fix"" to a variety of environmental, economic, and social problems associated with major crises of production within U.S. capitalism.I trace the development of Olmsted's naturalistic design philosophy, beginning with his work in New York City's Central Park through to his involvement with the Emerald Necklace.  His naturalistic landscape parks helped improve sanitation in Boston, and shaped the further development and growth of the city.By the 1970s, the parks had been modernized.  The original Olmsted design had been substantially modified and economic austerity measures led to neglect due to deferred maintenance.  By the 1980s, they had become derelict havens of crime with degraded ecosystems in need of restoration.Efforts to restore the parks of the Emerald Necklace represent a new park typology: the Conservancy Park.  This typology reflects the work of private park conservancies and not-for-profits as they seek to translate the entrepreneurial dimensions of neoliberal urbanism into the urban fabric.  These conservancies, along with city and state officials, have relied upon the ghost of Olmsted to guide the restoration process.  As part of an ""urban sustainability fix,"" the restoration of this park system is based less on scientific or technical criteria than on aesthetics and the economic fetishizing of the original Olmsted vision.  Park restoration, therefore, reflects a symbolic economy associated with the redevelopment and gentrification of post-industrial neoliberal cities.This dissertation reframes the discussion about parks and urban sustainability to focus more on a progressive (future-oriented) restoration of urban parks.  To date, park restoration in the Emerald Necklace, is past-oriented, conservative, and unsustainable.  Instead, parks are a process, and not just as a thing.  Twenty-first century American cities should focus on ecological function, rather than simply on the reification and recomposition of historic landscapes."
etd_434,The Handcrafted Utopia: Arts and Crafts Communities in America's Progressive Era,History,"Arts and Crafts Movement, Business, Decorative Art, Intentional Communities, Progressivism","In response to the trauma of industrialization and urbanization in the late-nineteenth century, the Arts and Crafts Movement took America by storm. Art exhibits, factories, workshops, and societies dedicated to handicraft, worker dignity, and the promulgation of beautiful art to the masses sprouted from California to Boston. Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead, Elbert Hubbard, and William Lightfoot Price were so enamored with the movement that they decided to build entirely new worlds—intentional communities—dedicated to pursuing those ideals. A student of John Ruskin, Whitehead founded an art colony called Byrdcliffe in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Hubbard, a former soap salesman, founded an Arts and Crafts community business, Roycroft, outside Buffalo, New York. Price, an architect, purchased land near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in order to found the Rose Valley Association as a haven for craftwork. They dreamt and enacted a way to reform the economic and social inequalities of industrial capitalism through communal living, artistic development, handcraftsmanship, and the sale of finely crafted furniture, architecture, pottery, and metalwork. In essence, this was what they believed was living “the art that is life.” For Price, Hubbard, Whitehead, and those who followed them, this meant producing and selling art with a social message as well as living everyday life with a sense of artistry—even the most common tasks treated as if they could be a work of art. I argue that capitalists, artisans, and leaders of communal groups creatively imagined a compromise between machine dominated industry and handicraft in late nineteenth century America. In doing so, they sought to critique industrial capitalism and carve out a space within the turmoil where craftspeople could once again flourish in community. However, Rose Valley, Byrdcliffe, and Roycroft were not just havens for craftsmanship, but were works of art in themselves—total sensory installations of the Arts and Crafts Movement—that could stand as model community-workshops suggesting that there could be an alternative to brutal industrialization."

Through an in-depth case study the dissertation examines the implementation of Maarpu’s antecedents, processes and outcomes. At the outset, the study begins to understand India’s bureaucratic functioning from a historical perspective and takes an organizational theory approach to understanding how organizational structures influence the decisions that organizational actors make. The single biggest finding and contribution of this study to collaborative governance literature is that collaborative structures are not necessarily designed for the mutual benefit of actors and institutions involved; rather, they are the result of the politics of bureaucratic structures that are designed to create winners and losers. I refer to this as the bureaucratic-collaboration paradigm. The study argues that this is the result of bureaucratic politics that infiltrates organizational structures and functioning. The study finds that policy and administrative entrepreneurs in positions of public authority influence the structure of collaborative initiatives creating a certain perception to take shape within the implementation hierarchy. The perception that Maarpu is a health-related initiative and not a collaborative initiative percolated through the implementation hierarchy and existing power balances, turf battles and institutional rivalries between participating departments helped maintain that perception. Findings from this revelatory case provide insights to refine theory, guide practice, and design better collaborative initiatives."
rel_etd_85,"The Immanent Body: A Thematic Study of the Logic of Immanence in Christology, Philosophy and Aesthetics",Religion,"Christ, Deleuze, immanence, philosophy","This dissertation is comprised of two sections: 1) ""The Immanent Body in Late Antiquity"": an analysis of late ancient christology, Stoicism and philosophy; 2) ""The Extended Body: Aesthetics"": depictions of monastic bodies in late medieval, Renaissance and contemporary art.I. The thesis of this dissertation can be stated as follows: the conditions under which immanence is thinkable in relation to bodies are found in conceptual personae. Contemporary philosopher Gilles Deleuze's concept of conceptual personae, developed in conjunction with French theorist Felix Guattari, helps navigate the complex relationship between bodies and ontology developed by these three ancient thinkers. In order to understand the formation of the conceptual persona of Christ in late antiquity, it was necessary to return to the work of Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Athanasius.II. The second part of the project begins with the Antony Series, which is a cluster of Renaissance works of art designated by a common theme. They represent St. Antony, who, being the first deep desert monastic, was the subject of my previous chapters. Therefore, the link between late antique conceptions of the monastic body and Renaissance art becomes explicit. Early Renaissance artists turned to an aesthetics of the monastic body in order to revolutionize painting, for it was during the late thirteenth century that expressive bodies were being created, bodies that would move painting towards the Renaissance. This dissertation analyzes the precise point of this transition through a christological (i.e., monastic) understanding of the painted figure."
etd_428,THE IMPACT OF A SUPPLEMENTAL READING INTERVENTION ON THE LITERACY SKILLS OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND NATIVE ENGLISH-SPEAKING FIRST GRADE CHILDREN,Reading and Language Arts,"Early reading intervention, English language learners, phonics, phonological awareness","A growing body of research has shown that interventions originally developed to help monolingual students with early reading skills offer the type of instruction necessary and effective for English language learners as well.  While the research on effective early reading interventions for English language learners is expanding, the majority of the research focuses on students whose native language is Spanish.  The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of a supplemental reading program that emphasizes phoneme awareness and phonics with small groups of both native English-speakers and ELLs whose first language is not Spanish.  This study utilized a multiple-baseline-across-participants design to investigate the effects of the intervention.  Analyses included gain score analysis from pretest to posttest, descriptive and visual analysis of nonsense word probe data, and four different non-overlap indices.   Findings indicate that small reading groups composed of ELLs from a variety of non-Spanish language backgrounds and native English-speakers benefitted from the code-oriented intervention, reinforcing the use of evidence-based instruction and more inclusive grouping practices for instruction.  When disaggregated by language status, both ELLs and native English-speakers benefitted from the supplemental reading instruction.  No consistent pattern was seen for the ELLs between pretreatment receptive vocabulary and gain scores.  Educational implications and areas for future research are discussed."
ppa_etd_84,The Impact of Citizens' Knowledge On Public Administration: Exploring the Links in Three Social Movements,Public Administration,"Communities of practice, Knowledge management, Public administration, Social movement knowledge","The dissertation develops a conceptual framework linking social knowledge and public administration. Social knowledge is understood broadly as the knowledge used by people in various roles, including experts, ordinary citizens, and public officials, to solve social problems. Social movement knowledge is examined as one particular type of social knowledge. The conceptual framework used to study the relationship between social movement knowledge and public administration is a combination of several literatures: citizen participation, civic innovations, community of practice, policy learning, and knowledge production in social movements. The framework connects social movement, policy expert, and administrative knowledge through the processes of social, policy, and organizational learning. This dissertation further illustrates the complex dynamics of the relationship between these elements of the framework by presenting empirical evidence from three cases of social movements.Observations from the three cases make several contributions to public administration scholarship. First, the analysis of the dynamics of movement knowledge production helps us understand how social knowledge enters the policy arena and thus becomes ""visible"" to policy-makers, how the character of its relationship to public policy changes over time, and whether the strategies of movement leaders and policy-makers depend on the dynamics of knowledge production. These insights inform the literature on collaborative governance by illuminating how knowledge production in social movements shapes knowledge interactions between movement knowledge and public sector actors. Next, the dissertation highlights how the interactions between movement communities and public organizations prevent or facilitate the transfer of movement knowledge into public organizations at different organizational levels. The findings enrich the understanding of the influence of external knowledge networks on public organizations and contribute to the literature on knowledge management in the public sector. Finally, the analysis explores the role of movement knowledge in mediating the relationships between policy learning at the national level and organizational learning at the local level. In particular, it examines how movement actors might help bridge public policies and organizational practices. The dissertation ends with a new theoretical model to explain how the knowledge of citizens manifested in social movements affects public policy and the implementation of public policy."
it_etd_78,The Impact of Cultural Assumptions about Technology on Choctaw Heritage Preservation and Sharing,Information Management and Technology,"Archetypes, Choctaw, Cultural Assumptions, Native American, Preservation, Technology","Neither the effects of information and communication technology (ICT) on culture nor the cultural roles of ICT are widely understood, particularly among marginalized ethno-cultures and indigenous people. One theoretical lens that has received attention outside of Native American studies is the theory of Information Technology Cultures, or ""IT Culture,"" developed by Kaarst-Brown. This theory was a groundbreaking and foundational way to understand underlying assumptions about IT and the conflicts surrounding IT use. Kaarst-Brown identified five archetypal cultural patterns or sets of ""underlying cultural assumptions"" about IT that impacted strategic use, conflict, and technology innovation. These dimensions included assumptions about the control of IT, criticality of using IT, value of IT skills, justification of IT investments, and perceived beneficiaries of IT. These dimensions clustered in five archetypal patterns: the Fearful, Controlled, Revered, Demystified, and Integrated IT Culture.The research study described in this thesis builds on Kaarst-Brown's work. This thesis determines the appropriateness and fit of the IT Culture theory and pervasiveness of archetypal patterns within a Native American tribe--the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. A mixed-method design, rather than traditional ethnography, is used to explore evidence of Kaarst-Brown's five cultural patterns and their dimensions within the Choctaw Nation. By extending this theoretical lens and utilizing a mixed-method approach, this thesis research contributes to an understanding of the assumptions about technology within a subset of culturally respected Choctaw families.This thesis project highlights the challenge of applying a broad IT theory to a specific ICT and context. Even though there was not 100% correlation between the theoretical lens and the data gathered, this theoretical application yielded valuable results. These results offered insights into the nature of the assumptions about ICT found in a multi-generational subset of people, and potential implications for future ICT development. Choctaws deeply invested in the Tribe's cultural heritage preservation and sharing efforts can now understand the potential impact of ICT before a new ICT is even introduced, rather than after the fact. Also while the original IT Culture theory utilized metaphor and symbols to explain the archetypal patterns, this thesis interpreted a new set of symbols from Choctaw folklore better suited to describe assumptions about ICT within the specific ethno-cultural context.In this project, the researcher is a non-Native American embedded in a community of a once-marginalized and long-suffering Native people, and thus, special considerations are discussed. The Choctaw have found their voice in contemporary society and are passionately asserting their self-determination as a proud Nation. As such, this thesis concludes with a discussion of practical implications for the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, as well as implications for Native American, ICT, and mixed-method research."
he_etd_57,The Impact of Curricular Learning Communities on Furthering the Engagement and Persistence Of Academically Underprepared Students at Community Colleges,Higher Education,"Academic Underpreparedness, Community Colleges, Learning Communities, Student Engagement, Student Persistence, Student Retention","This study examined the impact of basic skills curricular learning communities on academically underprepared community college students to determine if participation in such programs significantly contributed to student persistence from year one to year two. The conceptual framework that informed this study was Tinto's (1993) longitudinal model of student departure. In addition, the research on student engagement (Kuh, 2003b) served as a backdrop for considering how the basic skills curricular learning community programs may have influenced students' perceptions of their institution (support and encouragement) and their experiences (preparation, engagement with instructors, engagement with classmates, and feedback) and, in turn, contributed to student persistence.Sponsored by the Lumina Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, this study served as the quantitative analysis for the Pathways to Student Success initiative (Engstrom & Tinto, 2007), a multi-institution sample that included both self-reported data, collected by the survey instrument, and enrollment data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). The study included data from 13 community colleges with basic skills curricular learning community programs. All 13 colleges a) had a learning community program which linked a non-credit bearing basic skills course to at least one other course; b) had a learning community program for some duration and had institutional data to demonstrate its effectiveness in increasing student engagement and persistence; c) represented various types of structures and organization of programs to meet the needs of academically underprepared students; and d) served student populations considered at risk for not completing a degree/certificate. Each participating institution identified a learning community group and comparison (non-learning community) group to be surveyed in Fall 2003; in these comparison groups, the students' academic skills and individual characteristics were to resemble those of students in the learning community group.The use of a valid and reliable survey instrument allowed for analysis across institutions and group (learning community versus comparison groups). The survey instrument used in this study was a modified version of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) instrument (CCSSE, 2010) which helped to measure participation in a variety of educationally purposeful activities and the supportive nature of the institutional environment, commonly referred to as engagement. Finally, persistence data, collected from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), was used to track student enrollment from one academic year to the next. The NSC is a non-profit organization that provides student degree and enrollment verification services. The survey data and persistence data were used to determine the effectiveness of curricular learning communities for academically underprepared students in meeting two primary objectives: to increase student engagement and to increase student persistence.The results revealed no practical differences in levels of student engagement between basic skills curricular learning community and comparison group participants. One engagement variable--personal encouragement and support--significantly and positively contributed to student persistence from year one to year two. Being in a basic skills curricular learning community significantly and positively contributed to student persistence, with participants being 1.272 times more likely to persist than those students in the comparison group; however, the analysis did not allow for causal conclusions between curricular learning community participation, student engagement, and persistence. The inclusion of group (learning community or comparison group) and engagement variables in the logistic regression model did not substantially increase correctly predicting student persistence. The results and limitations of this study suggest the need for continued research on basic skills curricular learning communities as an intervention strategy designed to strengthen the academic skills of underprepared students, facilitate student engagement, and foster student persistence"
etd_751,The Impact of Environmental Policies and Innovation on the Investment in and Use of Natural Gas-Fired Combined Cycle Generators in the US Electricity Sector,Public Administration,"environmental policy, innovation, natural gas, NGCC","Developments over the past thirty years have contributed to increased natural gas generation in the US electricity sector. As a result, natural gas generation surpassed coal for the first time in history in 2016. In addition to low natural gas prices, developments with the natural gas-fired combined cycle generator (NGCC) have contributed to the rise of natural gas. In the 1990s, technological innovations led to substantial efficiency gains for NGCC, rendering these generators cleaner and more efficient than other widely available sources of power generation during that period. In the early 2000s, the US experienced the largest short-term increase in generation capacity in history, with over 70% of this new capacity installed as NGCC. Initially, much of the new NGCC capacity only provided power when energy demand was at its highest. Since 2003, NGCC utilization has nearly doubled, and NGCC is increasingly used to provide baseload power. The purpose of this dissertation is to scrutinize these developments with NGCC to better understand how energy and environmental policies influenced the time and location of capacity changes, how this capacity has been used, and the role of technology on both.The first essay in this dissertation evaluates the impact of a government-sponsored research program on NGCC innovations in the 1990s. From 1992-2000, the Department of Energy partnered with two US turbine manufacturers, General Electric (GE) and Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (SWPC), in a cost-sharing program called the Advanced Turbine System to stimulate efficiency innovations for NGCC technology. Using data from the European Patent Office’s worldwide patent database (PATSTAT), I evaluate innovative activity in advanced turbine technology by the program participants and their competitors. Using a negative binomial model, I find GE increased the volume of their patents towards the end of the program and afterwards, while SWPC had higher patent citations for patents filed during the program relative to competitors. These observed changes in patenting activity merit further investigation into why these changes took place, and how the resulting patents translated into commercialized technologies in the US and abroad.The second essay evaluates the impact of policy anticipation on natural gas capacity growth during a time in which substantial natural gas capacity came online. I hypothesize that areas expecting nonattainment designations resulting from changes in the ozone and particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) rushed to complete installations before new environmental regulations took place in 2004 and 2005. I use EIA and EPA data from 1997-2009 to evaluate the role of policy anticipation on capacity investment with difference-in-difference models. My results show areas expecting nonattainment designations had more natural gas capacity growth than areas not facing nonattainment, on the order of 10% for ozone and 13% for particulate matter, per year. This study thus finds that substantial investment in environmental technology may take place in anticipation of policy changes.The third essay considers how this new natural gas capacity is being used. Recent climate regulations aim to increase utilization of NGCC generators to offset coal generation and, consequently, reduce carbon emissions. There have been substantial increases in utilization for some NGCC generators in the last ten years, but most remain below baseload levels. This paper examines the factors that have driven NGCC utilization to date. I use a random-effects model to evaluate the relationships between environmental policies and natural gas prices on NGCC utilization. I find that both low natural gas prices and cross-state air pollution policies drive increases in utilization; however, the size of the impact by the environmental policies depends on the age of the plant. I use the estimates from this model for a counterfactual analysis which reveals the cross-state air pollution policies have had nearly three times the impact of low natural gas prices on utilization from 2003-2014."
etd_368,The Impact of HIV-Related Stigmatization on Medication Adherence among  HIV-Infected People: A Test of Two Explanatory Mechanisms,Psychology,"Adherence, Depressive symptoms, Disclosure concerns, HIV Stigma","Stigmatization (i.e., social discrediting and devaluation) due to HIV status may interfere with disease management among persons living with HIV (PLWHA) through associations with disclosure concerns and depressive symptoms. This study tested the hypotheses that disclosure concerns and depressive symptoms would mediate the association of stigma to treatment adherence (medication and clinic appointment adherence) in an outpatient sample of PLWHA (N = 174; 47% White, 41% African-American). Participants completed measures of stigma-related experiences, concerns about disclosing HIV status, depression, and medication adherence; chart data were obtained to characterize clinic appointment attendance. In the first set of analyses, simple mediation models indicated that disclosure concerns mediate the association between stigma and medication adherence (? = -0.097; 95% CI: -0.212 to -0.003), but not the association between stigma and clinic attendance. In the next set of analyses, depressive symptoms were shown to mediate both the stigma-medication adherence association (? = -0.113; 95% CI: -0.232 to -0.034) and the stigma-clinic attendance association (? = 0.397; 95% CI: 0.172 to 0.723). To augment these analyses, serial mediation models tested the serial effect of disclosure concerns on depressive symptoms in the stigma-treatment adherence association. The serial mediation analyses were significant (? = -0.025; 95% CI: -0.068 to -0.004 for medication adherence; ? = 0.118; 95% CI: 0.039 to 0.237 for clinic attendance), providing evidence that stigmatizing experiences are negatively associated with medication adherence and missed clinic appointments indirectly through the serial effect of disclosure concerns on depressive symptoms. Disclosure concerns and depressive symptoms are two mechanisms worthy of further research to enhance our understanding of the association between HIV stigma and treatment adherence."
psy_etd_167,The Impact of Incentives on Neuropsychological Test Performance: An Analog Study,Psychology,"Assessment, Effort, Incentives, Symptom Validity","Concussion, also known as mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), represents a common injury in children, young adults, and athletes in particular. High rates of malingering have been demonstrated in individuals with MTBI when faced with monetary incentives, but research is yet to explore the impact of other incentives on test performance. The present study sought to examine the rate of effort test failure, symptom report, and neuropsychological test performance in college students assigned to one of three conditions: Fake Good, Fake Bad, and No Incentive conditions. All groups were asked to simulate concussion and provided a description of the injury and common symptoms. The Fake Good group was asked to pretend to be an athlete seeking to return to play following injury. The Fake Bad group was asked to pretend to be seeking academic accommodations after injury. The No Incentive group was provided no additional information. A sample of 171 participants was randomly assigned to one of three groups. Participants completed a symptom report, brief neuropsychological battery, and symptom validity test. The results suggested that the Fake Bad and No Incentive groups showed higher symptom report, weaker neuropsychological test performance, and higher rates of effort test failure than the Fake Good group. Regardless of group, effort test failure explained a significant amount of variance in neuropsychological test performance. The implications and limitations of the current findings are discussed, in addition to future directions for study."
etd_245,The Impact of Natural Resource Booms on Local Economic Conditions,Economics,,"My research examines the impacts of natural resource booms on local economic conditions. Each chapter relies upon evidence from the three-state region of Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. A combination of rising prices and advancements in extraction technologies led to a boom in oil production in the region. This boom represents an exogenous shock to local economic conditions.The first and second chapters of my dissertation examine the impact of this exogenous labor demand shock that increased earnings in the three-state region. The first chapter analyzes the impact of earnings growth on net migration rates. My estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in earnings will increase the net migration rate by nearly 3 percentage points in oil counties, consistent with theoretical models of local labor markets and migration. The second chapter examines the extent to which labor force participation and Disability Insurance (DI) are substitutes, since DI becomes more attractive as outside employment options decline. Consistent with evidence from previous studies, my estimates indicate a higher degree of substitutability for current workers. I find that a 10 percent increase in earnings will reduce DI payments by 10 percent and DI participation by nearly 7 percent.The third chapter studies the impact of local economic conditions on the sales and income tax bases. I find that increases in the value of oil produced substantially increase the sales and income tax bases. More specifically, during the boom, a doubling in the value of oil produced led to an 18 percent increase in the sales tax base and a 16 percent increase in the income tax base for oil counties in North Dakota."

Using a 2x2 experimental design, this study explores the emotions of sadness and anger, as well as the concept of schadenfreude in relationship to stakeholders' perceptions of corporate reputation. In addition to using the previously tested emotions of sadness and anger in this context, the concept of schadenfreude (the feeling of pleasure one experiences when a person or organization suffers a misfortune or set back) was re-introduced to the field to better assess its potential role in the crisis communication process, specifically its relationship with perceived corporate reputation. Additionally, both third-person effect and social identity theory were introduced to explore their presence, and potential application, in future crisis communications. While the stimulus materials were unsuccessful in creating significantly different emotions in the subjects, there was an indication that schadenfreude as a concept is present in crisis communication scenarios and that it may have a distinctly different effect on perceived reputation than its more negative counterparts of anger and sadness. The presence of a third-person effect, a previously under-studied concept in crisis communications, was found and social identity theory held true, predicting perceived reputation based on identification with one or another party/group. Finally, in an effort to control for demographic variables, gender was found to have had a mitigating effect on reputation."
etd_311,The Impact of Self-Efficacy on Willingness to Try Emerging Formats of Digital Content,School of Information Studies,"Content consumption, Early adoption, Self-efficacy, Willingness to try","Prolific research on self-efficacy, willingness to try, and early adoption has repeatedly demonstrated correlation between these variables (Covington, 1984; Rogers, 1963; Bagozzi, 1992; Davis, 1993). Yet when it comes to practical application in the interactive industry (for example, among digital advertising agencies or product developers), the strategy of audience-targeted marketing (appealing to a specific group) often relies heavily on demographic personas rather than psychological personas, in large part because such persona types are easily identified and accessible: e.g. ""I am an early adopter,"" or ""I am a suburban soccer mom."" These demographic personas draw heavily from Everett Rogers (2003) who identified consistent characteristics among early and/or willing adopters: age (generally under 30), income level (moderate to high), education level (college and beyond), and level of social interaction (high). Yet there is significant weakness with creating demographic-based personas such as this because this method fails to identify intrinsic motivators. For example, the above characteristics can be used to create a persona such as a ""Stay-at-Home Mom"": 29, college educated, household income $75-100K, and active in the community. However, this does not necessarily lead to similar behaviors among each ""Stay-at-Home Mom,"" because despite sharing demographic categorization, each person will have varying underlying psychological makeup and motivation; one mother might have high self-efficacy and one might have low self-efficacy, and that is likely to impact willingness to try new technology.Therefore, the ultimate goal of this study - What is the impact of self-efficacy on willingness to try emerging formats of digital content? - was to provide evidence of more significant correlation between self-efficacy and willingness to try emerging formats of digital content as opposed to demographic segmentation and willingness to try emerging formats of digital content, with emphasis on self-efficacy as the independent variable and the strength of its relationship with the willingness to try variable. Evidence of correlation, which was provided in this study, reduces the ""high uncertainty [of the high-tech market] for both suppliers and consumers,"" resulting in more targeted and effective marketing and product development (Huh & Kim, 2008, p. 46) - allowing for the targeting of psychological motivators rather than demographics. Additionally, such conclusions will allow for efficient, successful encouragement of adoption by either targeting high self-efficacy populations or reducing psychological risk for low self-efficacy populations. Emerging formats of content can then be presented and tried without fear or confidence-reduction."
tl_etd_244,The Impact of Standards-Based Reform on Special Education: An Exploration of Westvale Elementary School,Teaching and Leadership,"Disability Studies, No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, Special Education, Standards-Based Reform","A critical, interpretivist, qualitative study, this project examines how standards-based reform impacts special education at an urban school, called Westvale Elementary School. The school was labeled a Persistently Low Achieving school under the No Child Left Behind Act and was thus required to undergo a ""transformation"" process. The demographics of the school at the time of the study were: over 95% free and reduced lunch, 40% Limited English Proficiency, and over 20% students with disabilities. The racial makeup of the school is: 50% Hispanic or Latino, 35% Black or African American, and 10% white. My methodological approach drew primarily upon 19 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with teachers, administrators, and policy makers. All participants were either associated with, working at, or overseeing Westvale Elementary School. I also conducted observations at over 15 public events relevant to the study. Interview and observation data were contextualized through an examination of public documents, such as policy statements or media reports.Findings indicate that the transformation process that Westvale was required to undertake was both a dramatic and sanction-laden one. For instance, prior to the transformation process, Westvale operated fully inclusive classrooms and afterwards the school shifted to a variety of self-contained, tracked, and pull-out programs. Thus, a key finding of this study was that standards-based reform impacted the physical inclusion of students with disabilities, even if they were accessing, at least to some degree, regular education content. Findings also showed how standards-based reform policies, including the implementation of the Common Core standards, testing, teacher and leader evaluations, and accountability systems significantly impacted special education, particularly in this ""failing"" school. Financial incentives, the media, and research all played distinct roles in disseminating standards-based reform ideology, which forced failing urban schools to adopt standards-based reform policy, even if local educators and administrators believed that the policies negatively impacted students. Unfortunately, the study also documents how special education is often an after-thought during local, district, state, and national policy-making, which resulted in policies ill-suited for the needs of students with disabilities. Finally, I illustrate how standards-based reform relies on discourse that blames teachers for the failures of urban schools, essentially removing the need to remedy the inequities existent in our educational system. I conclude this study with a series of recommendations directed to teachers, administrators, and policy-makers."
etd_439,The impact of surface water-groundwater interactions on water quality in an urban stream,Earth Sciences,"Chloride, Nitrate, Road Salt, Surface water-groundwater interactions, Urban streams","Stream restoration is a billion dollar business in the United States, and one of the processes restoration projects often try to improve is surface water-groundwater interaction. Groundwater is a key component of nutrient cycling, as it is where dissolved organic carbon and zones of anoxia can interact with the nitrate dissolved in the surface water. Groundwater also generally has greater total dissolved ions, as movement through pore space is many times slower than flowing surface water. Restoration projects that enhance surface water-groundwater interaction may help improve urban stream water quality.In an effort to decrease floods, many cities have physically altered streams to move water downstream as quickly as possible.  Engineering projects result in straightened channels, armored banks with boulders or cement, incised channels, and removed riparian vegetation, sometimes even burying streams and making them part of storm sewer systems.  This process, plus the large amount of impervious surface cover in cities, results in runoff going directly into streams, to be discharged downstream, instead of infiltrating to groundwater; this causes the streams to have flashy hydrographs and lowers baseflow. Many nonpoint source pollutants are discharged to urban streams, including heavy metals, pathogens, road salt, and nutrients. Urban planning is evolving and city planners now often recognize the importance of streams, even if just for aesthetic purposes, and when it is monetarily feasible, some cities are restoring urbanized streams to more natural designs. The goal of my research is to study how surface water-groundwater interactions, promoted by restoration practices, impact water quality in urban systems.The study site for this research is a first-order stream located in Syracuse, NY.  Meadowbrook Creek emerges from a stormwater retention basin to flow 5.5 km downstream before discharging into the Erie Canal. There are two distinct reaches to the stream: the upper 4 km, which are heavily urbanized and flow along a bouldered, incised channel down the middle of a boulevard with no riparian vegetation.  The most downstream 1.5 km, however, are more natural, with a meandering channel, established floodplain, and mature riparian vegetation.  This dichotomy was used to investigate how effects of stream restoration, specifically reconnection of surface water to groundwater, impact surface water chemistry.I made bi-weekly longitudinal surveys of stream water chemistry in the creek from May 2012 until June 2013. Chloride concentrations in the upstream, urbanized reach were influenced by discharge of road salt during snow melt, peaking at 1440 mg/L. However, the natural, downstream reach had less temporal variation, only peaking at 1049 mg/L, due to buffering by lower chloride groundwater discharge.  In the summer, there was little-to-no nitrate in the upper reach due to limited sources and high primary productivity, but concentrations reached over 1 mg N/L in the lower reach where riparian vegetation shade the stream. When temperatures fell below freezing, nitrate concentrations in the upper reach increased to 0.58 mg N/L, but were still lower than the natural reach, which averaged 0.88 mg N/L. Urban stream restoration projects that restore floodplain connection may impact water quality by storing high salinity road runoff during winter overbank events and discharging that water year-round, thereby attenuating seasonal fluctuations in chloride.  Contrary to prior findings, we observed floodplain connection and riparian vegetation may alter nitrate sources and sinks such that nitrate concentrations increase longitudinally in connected urban streams downstream of disconnected reaches.I investigated the processes controlling chloride movement and storage in the lower floodplain further by building a 3D groundwater flow and solute transport model. The model was calibrated to hydraulic head across the floodplain and the observed baseflow groundwater discharge to the stream.  The model was validated by comparing simulated chloride concentrations in the floodplain groundwater to observed field data. The main mechanism transporting chloride to the floodplain aquifer was winter overbank flood events during snowmelt or rain-on-snow precipitation, and flooding recharges floodplain groundwater directly. The model accurately predicts the maximum winter chloride concentration in the floodplain and the residence time of chloride as it is slowly released to surface water. Restoration projects that promote overbank flooding in winter have the potential to mitigate the negative ecosystem impacts of road salt in areas with high chloride contamination by temporarily storing chloride in groundwater, buffering surface water concentrations, and minimizing first-flush concentrations following periods of road salting.Finally, I investigated the sources and sinks of nitrate in the stream to evaluate what impact restoration may have on nutrient cycling. Altered channel morphology in urban streams changes the relative importance of nutrient sinks throughout the year, limiting denitrification and promoting assimilation. Nitrate injection tests and isotopic analysis of nitrate were performed to identify sources and sinks throughout the year, along with indirect measures of autotrophic uptake.  The main source of nitrate to the system appears to be leaky sewers, as shown by the nitrate isotopes and fluoride concentrations, with a potential soil nitrogen signal as well.  The urban reach has little-to-no nitrate in the spring through fall due to autotrophic uptake by filamentous green algae, as indicated by measurements of uptake properties along with measures of canopy density and algae mats. When temperatures decrease in the winter, autotrophic uptake shuts off and nitrate concentrations increase.  The downstream, natural reach has high nitrate concentrations throughout the year, as the assimilation sink is minimized due to riparian shading.  Nitrate isotopes do not indicate denitrification despite the surface water-groundwater interaction between the stream and floodplain. Uptake will lower nitrate concentrations for a large portion of the year, but restoration efforts that promote denitrification through increased dissolved organic carbon and increased hydrologic residence time may allow for permanent removal."
etd_96,The Incentive Effects of Health Insurance on Labor Market Outcomes and SSDI/SSI Utilization,Economics,"Elasticity, Health insurance job search, Health reform, Social Security Disability Insurance, Subsidy, Unemployment duration","Chapter 1While there has been a tremendous amount of literature on how Unemployment Insurance (UI) affects unemployed workers' job search behavior, there has been no previous study on how the health insurance premium subsidy affects this behavior. To fill the gap in previous studies, this paper analyzes the impact of the substantial federal health insurance premium subsidy on unemployment duration, using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). To begin this study, I detail the history of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 that was established to help keep unemployed workers insured. Furthermore, in order to help unemployed individuals reduce the cost of getting insurance, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provided a 65% health insurance premium subsidy for workers who lost their jobs involuntarily and elected to take up COBRA coverage. The extended unemployment duration resulting from this premium subsidy is equivalent to the effect of increasing Unemployment Insurance benefits by 56 percent which is equal to $168 per week. In order to identify the subsidy effect on the duration of unemployment, this paper compares the unemployment duration of two different unemployed cohorts who lost their jobs just before and after the end of subsidy eligibility. This study sheds light on the unemployed workers' job search behaviors during the Great Recession and finds that the COBRA premium subsidy causes unemployed workers to significantly increase their unemployment duration by 2.11 months. The empirical results are consistent with the predictions of job search theory.  Therefore, these estimates imply that the COBRA premium subsidy is having an important impact on the unemployed workers' job transition behavior.Chapter 2This paper analyzes the impact of the Employer Sponsored Insurance (ESI) expansion, part of the 2006 Massachusetts health reform, on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) participation decisions. I exploit the variation across SSDI beneficiaries among married couples to identify the causal effect of the reform. I find that for spouses without ESI, the positive effect of the ESI expansion on SSDI participation is 0.98 percentage points stronger than it is for spouses with ESI. These estimates imply that spouses without ESI increases SSDI beneficiaries by 0.0429% (i.e., the 10.73% of total SSDI beneficiaries increase in Massachusetts after the reform) and is associated with higher SSDI beneficiaries. Moreover, my estimates imply an elasticity of spouses without ESI with respect to SSDI beneficiaries of 0.0913. The calculations suggest that the health reform was more expensive than it might first appear because of an increase in SSDI expenditure.Chapter 3This paper analyzes the impact of the Medicaid expansion, part of the 2006 Massachusetts health reform, on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) participation decisions. I exploit the variation across SSI-disabled applicants to identify the causal effect of the reform on the SSI claim rate. My estimates imply that the reform reduces SSI-disabled claims by 0.098% (i.e., the 11.66% of total claims in 2008 in Massachusetts) and is associated with a lower initial SSI claim. These estimates also imply Medicaid-disabled expenditure can save around 1% by attending to small inefficiencies in the current program. However, the calculations suggest that the health reform was not as expensive as it might first appear because of reductions in SSI expenditure."
etd_607,"The Influence Of Peer-Led Team Learning on Underrepresented Minority Student Achievement in Introductory Biology and Recruitment and Retention In Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Majors",Biology,"Achievement, Biology, PLTL, Retention, STEM, URM","Increasing underrepresented minority (URM) participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is of increasing national importance as the United States continues to fall behind other nations in global economic competitiveness. These students constitute a large pool of potential STEM majors at the college level, but they have been recruited to and retained in STEM programs at significantly lower rates than students from other populations. As such, President Barack Obama’s President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has called on undergraduate science instructors to diversify their teaching methods and employ active learning strategies to improve students’ success in introductory or “gatekeeper” courses as well as improving students’ attitudes toward STEM. As a strategy that fosters active learning, Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) holds the potential to provide much of what PCAST deems necessary to improve URM student performance in introductory courses and retention in STEM majors. In the first of two studies presented herein, we found the PLTL model to be effective in improving scores for both URM and non-URM students in an introductory college science course. In the second study, we found PLTL to be associated with higher levels of retention among URM students. We conclude that participation in PLTL can help URM students who may struggle to identify with STEM to develop stronger STEM identities, which, along with higher achievement, may lead to enhanced retention."
etd_584,The Influence of Social Price Comparisons on Pricing Strategies,Marketing,"Price comparisons, Social price comparisons, Unfairness perception","This dissertation comprises two papers on consumers' social price comparisons influence on firm's pricing strategies. The first paper examines the impact of social price comparisons on behavior-based pricing, where revisiting customers are charged a different price than new customers. Price discrimination policies vary widely from company to company across different industries and even within the same industry. Some firms offer new customers the lowest price; others give preferential prices to their most loyal customers. Social price comparisons have a negative (positive) impact on customers’ transaction utility if the existing customer’s price is higher (lower) than a new customer’s price. Using an analytical model with vertically differentiated firms, the paper shows that the low-quality firm will reward past customers with relatively low prices when social price comparisons have a sufficiently large impact on utility.The second paper focuses on the specific market for subscription-based services, where price promotion offers are often extended only to new customers. When designing price promotion strategies, firms and managers who are interested in sustainable growth and long-term profits are not only concerned with increasing short-term revenue. It is also very important to consider the consumer behavioral impact from price promotions. The paper examines the effect of price discounts’ depth and frequency on long-term profit in service industries, comparing and contrasting the impacts that arise from changes in the reference price and unfairness perception from social price comparisons. Although both effects decrease consumers’ purchase probability, they have different impacts on the optimal promotion depth and promotion frequency."
etd_244,The Innovation Process of a Career Services Technology: A Comparative Case Study,Social Sciences,,"This study shows the influence of a career management system, eRecruiting, on the structure and work of three career service offices. The research examines how technology adoption influences institutional environments and how work environments affect technology adoption. A qualitative review of semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and participant observations examined the career offices' implementation processes of a career management system. The following research questions guided this investigation: What were the expectations, implementation processes, and outcomes of adopting a career management system in college career service offices?  How did the introduction of the technology affect staff duties and the division of labor within the office?  How did career service professionals in different positions assess the benefits and downsides of the new technology?A major finding from this study was that offices adopted career management technologies for reasons that had more to do with institutional culture than career management. The existing institutional culture influenced the motivation for adoption, the process of adoption, and the resultant changes to the office. The study found that the adoption of a career management system was not a stand-alone solution to the organizations' identified needs. Instead, it was clear that supporting infrastructure was essential and facilitated the creation of formalized positions to support the technology. The research also identified the technology as constitutive; it shaped the work of the office and how staff accomplished that work. The adoption of a career management system was viewed by most participants as useful, but it also created new work and exhibited control over the organization."
etd_720,"The interacting hydrologic responses to changing climate, watershed physical characteristics, river regulation, and land development in the northeastern United States",Civil and Environmental Engineering,"Climate change, Flow indicator, Northeastern United States, Regime shift, Teleconnection, Urban development","In this dissertation, the scale-dependency of hydrologic responses due to changing climate and regime shifts of large-scale circulation patterns and their teleconnection patterns were evaluated using long-term precipitation and discharge records in sub-basins with no development, and extensive development and riverine impoundments of the Merrimack River watershed. The Merrimack (New Hampshire-Massachusetts) is a 13,000 km2 forested (67%) watershed located in the northeastern United States. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to assess hydrologic responses to the potential effects of changing climate in sub-basins experiencing a range of development in order to help guide sustainable water management in the Merrimack River watershed and other northeastern basins. The objective of this research was to integrate hydroclimatic observations across basin size and anthropogenic disturbances (i.e. river regulation and land development) to understand the dynamic of hydrologic alterations under a changing climate.This dissertation consists of three research phases. In phase I, I assessed the interacting hydrologic responses to changing climate, watershed physical characteristics, river regulation, and land development under dry, average, and wet hydrologic conditions using long-term precipitation and discharge data of the Merrimack River watershed. I found that the effects of basin scale were limited to high (exceedance probability of less than 15%) and low (exceedance probability of greater than 60%) discharge events and were expressed as lagged discharge in larger sub-basins and earlier discharge in smaller headwater catchments. Annual discharge responded to increases in annual precipitation regardless of river regulation or land development. In general, the temporal trends showed greater decreasing trends in discharge under dry and greater increasing trends in discharge under wet hydrologic conditions compared to average years.In phase II, I explored the effects of Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO: metric of Sea Surface Temperature anomalies of the North Atlantic Ocean typically over 0-80°N) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO: metric of Sea-Level Pressure anomalies over the Atlantic sector 20°-80°N, 90°W-40°E) regime shifts on hydrologic responses to evaluate whether the intensified inter-annual variability in discharge is explained by natural climate cycles. I focused on AMO and NAO regime shifts of the early 1950s, 1970s, and 2000s and the effects on hydrology of the Merrimack River watershed. AMO regime shifts were strongly synchronized and preceded both precipitation and discharge across all study sites by one to two years, while NAO regime shifts indicated weaker associations. I found that all responses tended towards greater extremes from each regime shift to the next. Across many different ecological discharge indicators, high percentile values increased across regimes, while low percentile values decreased between regimes (with a few exceptions).In phase III, I evaluated the potential for discharge estimation considering annual or seasonal AMO and NAO teleconnection patterns with precipitation and discharge. When AMO was extremely positive (greater than 0.2), the magnitudes of annual precipitation and discharge correlation coefficients with AMO were obscured by river regulation or land development. In contrast, during the extreme negative phase of AMO (less than  0.2), river regulation and land development amplified the effects of changing climate on precipitation and discharge variations. AMO was positively associated with precipitation and discharge, while NAO showed a negative linkage. AMO positive phase was correspondent with average-to-wet discharge conditions at headwater catchments. When basin scale increased, confidence in the estimation of discharge conditions decreased for downstream developed sub-basins compared to headwater undisturbed catchments.The results from this research indicated that the Merrimack River watershed is expected to experience increases in discharge in the future and changing in timing and the seasonal distribution of this discharge; therefore development should be avoided on flood plains. Furthermore, the current reservoir storage capacity in the Merrimack should be improved in order to accommodate excess water input and minimize flood damage. Future research should target changes in the magnitude and timing of high discharge events in order to develop adaptation strategies for aging hydraulic infrastructure in the region. This dissertation will provide information for watershed planners and managers to inform future sustainable water use in the Merrimack River watershed and other northeastern basins."
etd_425,The Interdependence of Scientists in the Era of Team Science: An Exploratory Study Using Temporal Network Analysis,School of Information Studies,"mesoscopic network analysis, network analysis, scientific collaboration, temporal networks","How is the rise in team science and the emergence of the research group as the fundamental unit of organization of science affecting scientists’ opportunities to collaborate? Are the majority of scientists becoming dependent on a select subset of their peers to organize the intergroup collaborations that are becoming the norm in science? This dissertation set out to explore the evolving nature of scientists’ interdependence in team-based research environments. The research was motivated by the desire to reconcile emerging views on the organization of scientific collaboration with the theoretical and methodological tendencies to think about and study scientists as autonomous actors who negotiate collaboration in a dyadic manner. Complex Adaptive Social Systems served as the framework for understanding the dynamics involved in the formation of collaborative relationships. Temporal network analysis at the mesoscopic level was used to study the collaboration dynamics of a specific research community, in this case the genomic research community emerging around GenBank, the international nucleotide sequence databank. The investigation into the dynamics of the mesoscopic layer of a scientific collaboration networked revealed the following—(1) there is a prominent half-life to collaborative relationships; (2) the half-life can be used to construct weighted decay networks for extracting the group structure influencing collaboration; (3) scientists across all levels of status are becoming increasingly interdependent, with the qualification that interdependence is highly asymmetrical, and (4) the group structure is increasingly influential on the collaborative interactions of scientists. The results from this study advance theoretical and empirical understanding of scientific collaboration in team-based research environments and methodological approaches to studying temporal networks at the mesoscopic level. The findings also have implications for policy researchers interested in the career cycles of scientists and the maintenance and building of scientific capacity in research areas of national interest."
etd_288,"The list strength effect in cued recall: Estimation, implications, and models",Psychology,"computational modeling, cued recall, list strength, list strength effect, memory, memory models","Episodic memory, the processes by which information about experienced events is encoded into some long-term store and retrieved, has in recent years been studied in terms of retrieval tasks.  Typically, researchers consider how experimental manipulations affect performance on recall tasks or recognition tasks, but rarely both.  This dividing line came into being following the discovery of a null list strength effect in recognition.  In free recall tasks, memory performance for an item is harmed if memory for other items studied on the list are strengthened, but not so for recognition tasks.  Although the models that resulted from this dissociation represent a significant advance, that there is a dissociation at all between models of recognition and models of recall is not a desirable outcome.  Efforts should be made to return towards models of memory that can account for a wide variety of test tasks.  A consideration of cued recall, a task that incorporates elements of both recognition and free recall, may help advance the field in that regard.  To that effect, in a series of experiments, list strength effect in cued recall was measured.  In broad terms, the list strength effect in cued recall was found to be very small and largely indistinguishable from a null effect.  We apply the REM model to these findings and demonstrate that the inclusion of context as a test cue accounts for these findings.  This places cued recall, both in the REM model and the data, as a point of contact between the context-dominant free recall task and the item-dominant single item recognition task along the dimension of a critically diagnostic effect for models of episodic memory."

ant_etd_99,"The Maritime Archaeology of West Africa in the Atlantic World: Investigations at Elmina, Ghana",Anthropology,"Elmina, Maritime, Shipwreck","This dissertation focuses on the first maritime archaeology research project conducted in Ghana, specifically off the town of Elmina in the Central Region. Survey and diver investigations resulted in the discovery of a mid-seventeenth century shipwreck, which archaeological and archival research suggests may be the Dutch West India Company vessel Groeningen that sank after arriving to Elmina on a trading voyage in 1647. The site lies approximately 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) southeast of Elmina and is characterized by a mass of trade goods, including brass and pewter basins, brass manillas, lead rolls, trade beads, pins, cowrie shells, as well as large iron cannons.I utilize a multi-scalar approach in this research, which allows me to take the shipwreck as the basic unit of analysis (an event or événement as Braudel would place it in his three scales of history), and situate it within the broader sphere of the Atlantic World. This geographical and chronological construction, encompassing Africa, Europe and the Americas and spanning the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, can be considered an example of the longue dureé as defined by the Annales school, a level of analysis involved with long term structures and world views. In utilizing these multi-scalar constructs, the Elmina Wreck serves as an example of the maritime element within the interconnections of the Atlantic World. Artifacts from the wreck site provide insights into the commodities involved in exchange between Africans and Europeans on the coast, and speak to the culture contact and flow of commodities across different cultural contexts."

The found motivational orientations are compared to Confucian philosophy principles of self-cultivation illustrated in The Great Learning (DaXues`å>{t) which is considered the first of a set of Four Books (Sishusl`t). The manuscript's structure consists of a brief of three principles, followed by eight steps that promote individual self-cultivation. Researchers frequently utilize these steps as a connection between civil conduct applied to social and political order (e.g. Keenan, 2011, p. 37). This study uses this Confucian philosophical framework to reveal self-cultivation components related to the motives and aspirations of this select group; Western older adult learners. This study also aims to bridge Eastern motivation theory with Western approaches, making a contribution to both motivational theory and adult education fields of study.This research utilized semi-structured interviews of twenty one DPS-IM students (80.77% participation). Collected data revealed that the majority of the participants were working professionals who have been in their field for at least 10 years. The interview data revealed that self-cultivation was found to be the greatest motivational factor for this study group followed by self-improvement, self-transformation, and sense of responsibility; which are all supported by Confucian learning philosophy found in The Great Learning.This study suggests that even though in modern times, a 2000 year-old Eastern philosophy of learning is synonymous with the motives of adults seeking further education regardless of their cultural background."
etd_591,The Multi-Substrate Binding Specificity of Saposin B,Chemistry,,"Saposin B (sap B) is a holistic housekeeping protein inside the lysosome of human cells,  which is responsible for the degradation of sphingolipids. A deficiency of sap B caused by mutation will lead to the lysosomal storage disease (LSD) metachromatic leukodystrophy. Sap B is also found to interact with multiple substrates beyond sphingolipids. It is deemed the transport protein for coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is an important coenzyme in the cell respiration cycle. CoQ10 consists of 10 repeating isoprenyl groups. The affinity Co Qs were found to decrease as the number of isoprenyl groups decrease. As a result, it was hypothesized that atovaquone, an anti-malaria drug that has the same quinone unit as in CoQs but no isoprenyl group, would have no binding affinity by sap B. However, the Ka measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence microscopy between atovaquone and sap B was on the order of 104. We continued to investigate the binding between sapB and other substrates including anti-malarial drugs (chloroquine, artemisinin) and anti-arrhythmic drugs (dronedarone and amiodarone) as well as degradation products (A2E) deemed causative in the progression of macular degeneration that have a lipid like chemical nature. These investigations may help reveal the pharmacology of those drugs tested and/or further the understanding of the function(s) of sap B in humans."
etd_137,THE NON-ERYTHROID MEMBRANE SKELETON AND ITS ROLE IN MECHANOTRANSDUCTION,Physics,"FRET, Mechanotransduction, membrane skeleton, Spectrin, Supported lipid bilayer, Traction force","The thesis is concerned with questions regarding cellular bio-mechanics and cell surface interactions. A particular focus is thereby on the role of the spectrin membrane skeleton in transducing forces to and from non-erythroid mammalian cells. This spectrin based membrane skeleton has been the focus of much study in the context of red blood cells, as it determines their mechanical properties due to the lack of an extended actin based cytoskeleton. In stark contrast, the corresponding structure in non-erythroids is much less studied and understood, although it seems to play important roles in organization of membrane associated proteins, cellular mechanics, adhesion, traction and possibly mechanotransduction. In this work, I was able to determine the amount -down to the average copy number per cell- of the main protein components of the non-erythroid membrane skeleton, in model cell lines commonly used in cell-mechanics studies. The results of the measurements provided by combining a variety of optical microscopic and biochemical techniques, demonstrate that proteins associated with the membrane skeleton constitute a large (s10%) fraction of cellular proteins. These results are then compared with the respective quantities after mechanical stimulation of the cells. It is found that external forces result in both an up to 60% changes of the overall amounts of proteins as well as the protein composition of the membrane skeleton itself. In addition, it was established that the fraction of polyubiquitnated spectrin has significantly increased due to stimulation. The work helps to establish the fact that the spectrin based membrane skeleton, while often overlooked in non-erythroids, is indeed a verily generic and important system in mammalian cells that is also quite sensitive to external forces. Thus, the skeleton should be taken into account when studying cellular mechanics, membrane structure or composition.Furthermore, I present my successful work on integrating several light based methods to simultaneously measure traction forces of adherent cells as well as internal strains in their membrane skeleton. For the proof of principle experiments and optimization procedures, I used NIH-3T3 fibroblast and H9c2 (2 -1) cardiomyocyte cell lines, both of which are known to be mechanically active. Using my method, I demonstrate that the internal strains in the membrane skeleton of fibroblasts are correlated with the polyacrylamide substrate stiffness. The later has also a measurable impact on the generated cellular traction forces. These findings open up a first glimpse on the questions that can now be addressed with this method and it promises to help to refine our still rudimentary understanding of the interrelated mechanisms of cellular mechanotransduction and force generation machinery.Cells are exposed not only to mechanical forces but also to electrical, chemical and magnetic forces found in their environment. In a separate series of experiments, I observed that cellular behavior of 3T3 fibroblasts on glass supported lipid bilayers depend on the detail of lipid charge mixtures in the bilayer as well as the head group compositions. Live cell-supported lipid membrane hybrids are frequently used in dissecting membrane based inter-cellular communication. This work indicates that in the interpretation of the observed cell behavior on this hybrid system, the lipid bilayer itself and not only the protein augmentation can play an important role."
cfe_etd_58,The Other Side of Girls Gone Wild: The Emotional Labor of College Women's Sexual Decision-Making,Cultural Foundations of Education,"College women, Emotional labor, Sex, Sexual Decision-Making, Sexuality, Subjectivity","This research concerns the process of college women's emotional labor in sexual decision-making and how women talk about their sexual decisions via their negotiation of dominant social discourses. The study seeks to determine how the college experience nurtures women's sexual subjectivity; how it affects their negotiation of sexual messaging and social dominant discourse; and how it impacts the emotional work involved in the process. The study was conducted at three college campuses that vary relative to institutional type (i.e., public vs. private), social class, and race. The research was conducted in fall 2006 at Center State University, and in the spring and summer 2010 semesters at Northeast University and Upper Lake Community College. The qualitative study involved eight focus groups and 20 in-depth interviews and a total of 48 participants. Out of those 48, three women identified themselves as lesbian, three as bisexual, two as asexual, and one as queer. Two women chose not to identify. In regard to racial make-up, 36 women were white and the remainder identified as African American, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Latina, Korean, and Southeast Asian. All participants were of traditional college age (18 to 21), except for three women in their late 20s and early 30s. The forms of emotional labor that emerged were (a) how women understood and talked about the regulatory expectations and social norms of women's sexuality and how regulation shapes subjectivity, (b) how women's negotiation of those regulations in juxtaposition with their sexual desire demonstrates sexual subjectivity (c) how college served--and was perceived as--a ""bubble"" for women to more fully engage in acts of resistance and agency in response to gendered social expectations within a space that nurtured sexual subjectivity. Ultimately, the study focuses on young women's negotiation of sexuality and the emotional work that their talk reflects; it exposes ways in which women are thoughtful and reflective in their sexual decision-making while engaging with their sexual subjectivity."
etd_596,THE PACE AND TIMING OF CHANGING LANDSCAPES AS VIEWED THROUGH COSMOGENIC RADIONUCLIDES: SYNTHETIC AND REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE CENTRAL ANDES AND AMAZONIA,Earth Sciences,"Amazonia, Andes, cosmogenic radionuclides, erosion rates, landscape evolution, paleo-erosion rates","In the past three decades, the use of cosmogenic radionuclides revolutionized research in geomorphology. Cosmogenic radionuclides, such as 10Be and 26Al, accumulate within quartz crystals at a relatively well-constrained rate due to the bombardment of the Earth’s atmosphere by cosmic rays. Since the early 90’s, many studies utilized 10Be and 26Al to determine the pace and timing of vertical changes, or absence thereof, to the uppermost meters of the Earth’s surface. In particular, the ability to simply collect a bag of sand from the bottom of a stream and, after extracting the quartz from it, determine the average rate of surface lowering (i.e. the erosion rate) of the integrated catchment area upstream of that point, allowed many researchers to explore the linkages between climate, tectonics, and surface processes in evolving landscapes. In contrast to dozens of studies investigating the modern erosion rates, less than ten studies actually pushed the boundaries of this application to seek paleo-erosion rates by querying older sedimentary rocks for their 10Be content from the time the sediments were deposited. Analogous to the modern case, in which the cosmogenic nuclide inventory of alluvium reflects erosion rates, the cosmogenic nuclide inventory of quartz in independently well-dated sedimentary rocks contain a decayed dose that can be converted to a paleo-erosion rate. The work outlined within this dissertation builds on these concepts and combines the concentrations of radionuclides from modern river samples as well as sedimentary rocks to determine the pace and timing of landscape change in the Central Andes of Argentina and Central Amazonia.To date, the limits and assumptions embedded in the use of paleo-erosion rates have only been lightly addressed in the literature. No tool exists for the assessment of the sensitivity of paleo-erosion rate data to other site-specific variables, such as past sediment accumulation rates, unconstrained pre-sediment burial exposure time, and exhumation of previously buried deposits. Chapter one describes the well-established concepts behind the accumulation of 10Be and 26Al in quartz in different scenarios in which a parcel of rock or sediment exhumes or descends towards or away, respectively, from the Earth’s surface, and provides a tool that can help researchers identify the limits of the applicability of this method for site-specific conditions.Chapter two consists of the application of the methods described in Chapter one to build a record of paleo-erosion rates from the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene by probing the sedimentary rocks from the foreland of the Argentine Andes at 30°S. Here, approximately 5.5 km of sediment accumulated as the result of erosion of the adjacent Andes from ca. 15-2 Ma. The strata in the foreland were previously dated through magneto-stratigraphy, which provide independent age and burial rate constraint of the targeted units. Also, the history of deformation of the Precordillera fold-and-thrust belt is well constrained from both dating of thrust-top synsedimentary deposits and 2D balancing of cross-sections, which were confirmed through (U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronometry. Together, the knowledge established in the literature and the paleo-erosion rate record built in this study allowed the comparison of the histories of deformation, erosion, and sediment accumulation. With paleo-erosion rate records built for one section in the wedge-top, upstream of the Precordillera, and two from the foredeep, downstream of the Precordillera, the dynamics of erosion in concert with major deformation and mountain building in the Precordillera were constrained. The findings revealed a >2 Ma lag between the horizontal shortening rate (12-9 Ma) and erosion rate (7 Ma) maxima. This result has implications for our understanding of landscape evolution and mass-flux during orogenesis, especially critically tapered ones. Particularly, it can better inform modeling efforts that focus on tectonic and climatic influences on those mass fluxes.Chapter three consists of a synoptic view of the modern pattern of erosion in the arid South-Central Andes between 28°S and 36°S. Here, new millennial and decennial erosion rate data were produced for nine catchments draining the high Andes from the Argentine side as well as the Precordillera. These new data were combined with published data from arid catchments in Argentina both from the vicinities of the study area and from the southern edge of the Altiplano-Puna plateau, all tectonically active and arid areas. The Argentine dataset was used for comparison with the along-strike pattern of millennial and decennial erosion rates published for the Chilean side, which experiences a steep precipitation gradient, going from arid to temperate climate in less than a latitudinal degree near 32°S. Together, this synoptic view of along-strike erosion rates revealed a nearly identical pattern of erosion rates on both sides of the Andes; both show enhanced erosion rates between 32°S and 34°S, which taper off southward. The erosion rates show no correlation with other parameters, such as precipitation and vegetation, and are closely, but nonlinearly correlated with the mean catchment local gradient. Interestingly, the along and across-strike patterns of erosion of the South-Central Andes closely follow a published southward increase in total surface uplift since 10 Ma. The similarity of erosion along-strike on both sides in spite of different climatic conditions indicates that erosion of this area is closely related to tectonics, and not climate as previously proposed.Chapter four focuses on landscape changes in Central Amazonia, particularly in the lower Negro River valley and the Negro-Solimões interfluve. This region contains the topographic features of a completely abandoned, southward-flowing paleo-network that has been incised by modern northward-flowing rivers. It is of particular importance to the Amazonian landscape evolution not only because of its location near the junction of two major Amazonian rivers, the Negro and Solimões Rivers, but also because past environmental changes in the Negro Rivervalley promoted faunal endemism in the last 1 Ma. Using cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al, a new late Miocene burial age is constrained for the paleo-channel deposits, indicating that this landscape is older than previously thought, bearing important implications for the landscape and species evolution. Geomorphic analysis of fluvial metrics derived from a digital elevation model revealed a signal of base level fall in the Negro River valley, consistent with a modification of the valley or the Negro River channel itself. Given the timing of burial and the existence of a ubiquitous base level fall signal in the region, the paleo-network is probably a remnant of the ancestral Amazon drainage system. Its deflection was potentially facilitated by faulting in the lower Negro River valley and may be related to the regional tilting associated with the formation of the transcontinental Amazon River system caused either by dynamic topography or progressive flexural loading of the upper crust from west to east."

An orally administered protein therapeutic is predicted to increase patient adherence to medication and bring a patient closer to metabolic norms through direct effects on hepatic glucose production. The major problem facing oral delivery of protein therapeutics is gastrointestinal tract hydrolysis/proteolysis and the inability to passage the enterocyte. Herein we report the potential use of vitamin B12 for the oral delivery of protein therapeutics.We first investigated the ability of insulin to accommodate the attachment of  B12 at the B1 vs. B29 amino acid position. The insulinotropic profile of both conjugates was evaluated in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Oral administration of the conjugates produced significant drops in blood glucose levels, compared to an orally administered insulin control, but no significant difference was observed between conjugates. We also report, for the first time, a dose dependent response of a B12-insulin conjugate. We then explored the implications of  B12 conjugation on the biological activity of the potent peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide, with a K34R amino acid substitution. Various in vitro bioassays utilizing human embryonic kidney cells and human pancreatic islets were conducted and indicated  B12 has a minimally negative effect on GLP-1 biological activity. Finally we modified the structure of  B12 for future conjugation work. The modification of the 5'hydroxyl group of the ribose unit of  B12 to a carboxylic acid is predicted to benefit the field of B12 conjugation significantly with the ability to produce higher yielding and more stable  B12 conjugates."

With a focus on immaterial production - or the forms of coordinated social activity employed to produce knowledge and information in the networked information economy - this project ultimately aims to demonstrate how current intellectual property paradigms must be rearticulated for an age of digital (re)production. By considering the themes of ""Piracy"", ""Intellectual Property"", and ""Distributed Social Production"" this dissertation provides an overview of the current state of peer production and intellectual property in the Humanities and Writing Studies. Next, this project develops and implements a communicational-mediational research methodology to theorize how both discursive and material data lend themselves to a more nuanced understanding of the ways that technologies of communication and coordination effect attitudes toward intellectual property. After establishing both a methodology and an interdisciplinary grounding for the themes of the work, this dissertation presents a grounded theoretic analysis of piratical discourse to reveal what I call the ""piratical ethos"", or the guiding attitudes of individuals actively contesting intellectual property in piratical acts of distributed social production. Congruently, this work also investigates the material dynamics of piratical activity by analyzing the cultural-historical activity systems wherein piratical subjectivity emerges, emphasizing the agenic capacity of interfacial technologies at the scales of user and system.

The project uses multiscalar analysis, microhistory, and craft and industrial production as lenses for examining the production, distribution and use of local ceramics to explore changes in local craft production. The local production of ceramics allowed sugar plantation managers and owners to use local resources by providing ceramics used in the production of sugar which facilitated economic production on the island's plantations.  Sugar pots and cones were used directly in the production of sugar and other ceramic items like tiles and brick were used in the construction of industrial buildings used to boil and store sugar, the primary cash crop that was exported.  Sugar contributed significantly to the emergence of the sugar economy and the emergence of a reliance on enslaved laborer, which had profound impacts on social and economic systems in Barbados and the broader Atlantic world.The ceramics produced contributed a relatively low cost medium of sugar storage that fulfilled the planter's objective of maximizing financial profits associated with sugar production.  In addition, the marketing of ceramics contributed to parallel forms of economic production as from the inception the plantation operated kilns also produced a small proportion of domestic wares.  In time, these domestic wares were incorporated into internal marketing systems developed for and by the islands domestic population.  By the beginning of the nineteenth century, independently operated kilns were being operated by free blacks who specialized in the production of utilitarian domestic and household wares.This study focuses on archaeological and historical data associated with two pothouses located in the Parish of St. John, Barbados.  The study includes an analysis of the two sites and their associated ceramic assemblages.  It also, draws upon the rich historic accounts recorded in the detailed records of Codrington Plantation.  This is perhaps the most detailed primary source for information on eighteenth and nineteenth-century industrial pottery production in the Caribbean.  The study also draws upon an array of historical information for the island including ethnographic data collected by Jerome Handler in the 1960s from the village of Chalky Mount in the Parish of St. Andrew.The Codrington records and the ethnographic accounts provide details regarding the ware types, production systems, and marketing of Barbadian made ceramics.   The site data and historical analyses combine to inform about the relationships of people involved in organizing, producing, selling wares as well as their changing role in the local economy. A typological schema has been produced that will assist researchers in understanding both industrial and local ceramic production. This scheme involves three types of ceramics production in Barbados; the first is plantation based and relied generally on enslaved labor to produce architectural and industrial wares for plantation use. The second involves independent or off-plantation production producing domestic, industrial and architectural wares for the plantations and also the open market relying on either free or enslaved potters. The third type involves the production by free potters of domestic and craft items for the local and tourist markets."
etd_657,The Politics of Corporate Social Responsibility in Contemporary India,Sociology,"Corporate Social Responsibility, India","In recent years, corporations worldwide have embraced activities related to social and economic development in the name of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In some circles, CSR is practiced as corporate “shared value.” These policies and strategies are ostensibly intended to uplift and “develop” the lives of workers and communities. While there are many criticisms of CSR activities across the world, very few scholarly inquiries take a critical look at CSR practices specifically in India.This dissertation critically examines CSR as it has been practiced by a specific indigenous multinational corporation in India. Using this firm’s steel plant as a case study, and using a combination of archival and genealogical research and interview analysis, this dissertation makes three important contributions: (1) it demonstrates how, even though CSR strategies in India are routinely described in popular discourse as philanthropic activity in the vein of Gandhian trusteeship, there are important differences between the two. Although contemporary CSR has “family resemblances” with Gandhian trusteeship, it is less interested in the stewardship of wealth (as Gandhi intended) and more attuned to the expansion of markets; (2) it illustrates how the practice of CSR is predicated on various land acquisition strategies that lead to what David Harvey and others have called “accumulation by dispossession” ; and, finally (3) the analysis also reveals how CSR’s success depends not only on external advertisements, but also on a form of internal branding campaign intended as a set of disciplining and “civilizing” practices that inculcates among a group of vulnerable workers -- mostly migrant and newly landless peasants -- what one scholar has called a “will to improve.”"
etd_445,The Post-Colonial Language and Identity Experiences of Transnational Kenyan Teachers in U.S. Universities,Reading and Language Arts,"Kenyan Education, Language, linguistic imperialism, Multilingualism, Post-colonial education, Teacher Identity","This qualitative interview study explored how transnational Kenyan teachers experienced marginalization of their African languages and identities in both the Kenyan and the United States contexts, but reclaimed those languages and identities as important assets in their teaching of English language. The study asked: What are the post-colonial language and identity experiences of transnational Kenyan teachers in graduate education programs in the United States in the following domains: a) their primary and secondary schooling in Kenya b) their teacher preparation in Kenya c) their teaching experiences in Kenya; and d) their graduate education in the United States?Post-colonial theories and linguistic imperialism theories provided a lens for understanding participants’ language and identity experiences in Kenya, a post-colonial African nation that adopted English as the language of instruction in schools following independence, and in the United States, where issues of language, race, and power are intrinsically connected. Data sources included transcripts from fifty open-ended qualitative interviews, which were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify themes within and across participants’ experiences.Two major themes emerged from the analysis. The first major theme was marginalization. Participants’ African languages and identities were marginalized in both the Kenyan and the United States contexts. However, in various ways, participants resisted this marginalization. The second major theme was that participants (re)claimed their African languages and identities as assets, both in their personal lives, and their professional lives as teachers and future teacher educators. These findings have implications for literacy research and practice in Kenyan education, as well as for educational research and practice in U.S. universities."
etd_290,The Potential For Greek Housing To Shape Diet And Exercise Patterns: An Exploratory Intra-Greek Comparison,Nutrition Science and Dietetics,"Diet, Dietetics, Exercise, Greek Life, Nutrition, Sorority","Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the differences in diet and exercise patterns in sorority women from campuses with different Greek Life structures. The goal was to determine if the centralization of the sorority through the presence of a chapter sorority house altered these health behaviors for any of the women.Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to gather data from sorority members at two northeastern universities during October of 2014. Women created a one-week food and exercise record through the MyFitnessPal application for smartphones. They were also asked to complete a survey with questions regarding demographics, eating patterns, and the Body Shape Questionnaire-34 (BSQ). The dependent variables of dietary macronutrient and micronutrient intake, total energy intake, physical activity frequency, calories burned through exercise, and BSQ-based Body Image Score were tested for statistical differences as a function of the presence or absence of centralized sorority housing.Participants: The participants were 44 sorority women from two college campuses. Electronic food and exercise records were collected from 12 women in four sorority chapters with centralized housing arrangements. Electronic food and exercise records were collected from 32 women from the same four sororities in decentralized living arrangements at a different university.Results: Women living in centralized sorority houses had a higher BMI (p<0.05), healthier eating patterns (Diet Score p<0.001), lower total energy intake (p=0.020), lower exercise frequency (p=0.008), burned fewer calories (p=0.015), and had less preoccupation with body size and shape (Body Image Score p=0.030) than the women in decentralized sorority living arrangements. Both groups of women under consumed total calories, resulting in diets deficient in most micronutrients. Both groups of women exceeded sodium and saturated fat recommendations.Conclusions: The presence of a campus sorority house influences the diet and exercise habits of sorority women. The results of this research point to a need for further studies to evaluate differences within and between Greek Life populations to better understand the social mediators of health behaviors; the work should also be expanded to explore similar questions in fraternities. It is likely that sorority women, regardless of housing arrangements or campus culture, would benefit from nutrition education regarding total energy and macro- and micro- nutrient requirements."

Previous studies of fire-affected soil water repellency have identified the strength and persistence of SWR after burning in different types of forests but have not identified consistent timelines for post-fire recovery. This study explores the impacts of fire and plant community succession on SWR and infiltration properties to further inform rangeland managers regarding the long-term impacts of prescribed fire on SWR and infiltration properties in sagebrush-steppe ecosystems.The objectives of this study were: 1) To explore the temporal effects of prescribed burning in a sagebrush-dominated landscape; 2) To investigate spatial variability of soil hydrologic properties with changes in plant cover (aspen, big mountain sage and low sage) and soil texture; 3) To determine relationships among soil organic fractions, soil hydrophobicity and infiltration properties.Fieldwork was conducted in paired watersheds in the Northwest Watershed Research Center at Upper Sheep Creek (USC) and an unburned adjacent watershed Wood Gulch Creek (WGC), southwest of Boise, Idaho. These two watersheds are very similar in that they have three dominant vegetation cover communities: Low Sage, Big Mountain Sage and Aspen, similar elevation and topography. They differ in that USC is a long-term enclosure from cattle grazing and the site of a prescribed fire, while WGC watershed is open to cattle grazing and has not burned in recent history. Prior measurements of pre-burn and post-burn infiltration tests and Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) at USC were extended in this study. Several analysis methods were used to calculate hydraulic conductivity, sorptivity and Water Repellency Index (WRI). Additionally, ten replicate soil samples of 15 cm depth were cored from each transect and used to analyze the fraction of organic matter and the static water-soil contact angle.The recent analyses showed that the severity and occurrence of surface soil water repellency was substantially reduced eight years after fire treatment within the area originally covered with big sage, where the fire intensity were greatest. Also, hydraulic conductivity significantly increased in each vegetation cover type over the eight-year period of study. The comparisons among soil hydrological properties shows that hydraulic conductivity is not directly related to SWR, and sorptivity is inversely related to WRI in a general sense. The spatial variability in conductivity is primarily controlled by soil texture, whereas sorptivity is affected by soil organic content and soil wettability. The frequency of SWR was least in Low Sage and greatest in Aspen, reflecting a significant difference in soil organic content. Measurements of static water contact angle and organic content analysis show a strong positive correlation, primarily for Aspen and Big Sage sites. However, many soil samples from Big Sage and Aspen sites had substantial organic matter yet were not hydrophobic. It is concluded that soil organic matter content is not well correlated to SWR at microsite scale but may applicable as general indicator of infiltration capacity or SWR at larger scale within similar soils and vegetation type. The increased infiltration capacity eight years after fire at USC Low Sage indicates a long-term benefit of prescribed fire for increased fodder production and runoff management in semiarid rangeland."

Virtual collaborators engaging in creative work often deal with these challenges, even more so when tasked with expressing their emotions to distant partners.This study seeks to determine the social factors and tools that impact the quality of an online creative collaboration. Members of the Kompoz.com music composition community were surveyed to solicit projects that had the potential to be optimal collaborations. Judges listened to these songs and measured how much each song prompted them to move. This measure, called groove, was used as an indication of a successful collaboration. Judges assisted in selecting one case that was an exemplar of groove, and another that urged them to move much less, to stand as an exemplar of diminished groove. The comparative case method was used to compare and contrast the tools, social practices, and skills employed in each project, and offers guidelines for the design of and participation in online creative communities."

More than from its formal job description, the rotating Presidency's four roles derive from the (informal) decision dynamics of the Council and the expectations it faces from its fellow Council members and the other EU institutions. Together, these factors can motivate the member state holding the Presidency to wield every tool at its disposal and even, where necessary, unilaterally sacrifice its own national interest, to achieve agreement in the Council, in effect biasing the incumbent in favor of further European integration. This study uses ""hard case""-evidence from United Kingdom (UK) Council Presidencies to test the predictions of this ""Presidency effect"" (PE) about member state behavior and its consequences for overall decision outcomes."

It explores the two-part question, how do foreign security actors (ministerial advisors and security force trainers, advisors, and commanders) attempt to influence their host-nation partners and what are their perceptions of these approaches on changes in local capacity, values, and security governance norms? I argue that security sector reform (SSR) programs in fragile states lack an explicit theory of change that specifies how reform occurs. From this view, I theorize internationally led SSR as ""guided institutional transfer,"" grounded in rationalist and social constructivist explanations of convergence, diffusion, and socialization processes. Responding to calls for greater depth and emphasis on interactions and institutional change in SSR research, I examine NATO's efforts in Afghanistan as an extreme case of SSR in which external-internal interactions were the highest. A stratified, purposive sample of 68 military and civilian elites (24 ministerial advisors, 27 embedded field advisors and commanders, and 17 experts and external observers) participated in a confidential, semi-structured interview. Content analysis of interviews and supporting documentation reveal that participants perceived modest impact on capacity development in both the Afghan security ministries and security forces; however, they perceived limited normative impact on both organizational and individual levels. Second, participants who used heavy-handed or transactional approaches rarely saw positive or enduring outcomes with their counterparts. Third, legitimacy-based approaches that elicited partner engagement were perceived as more effective than power-based approaches (e.g., demands, incentives), though the techniques participants favored (e.g., persuasion, guided discovery learning) varied by level and context. Fourth, in addition to Afghan political and cultural constraints, NATO's campaign strategy, accelerated timeline, and high resource inflow created perverse incentives for some advisors and leaders to pressure or induce their counterparts in the spirit of progress. Finally, advisors with the unique ability to develop close relationships were more likely to promote capacity transfer and, elicit curiosity and dialogue on security governance norms (e.g., civilian control, ethical leadership)."
it_etd_82,The Public Library as Health Information Resource?,Information Science and Technology,"Case study, Consumer health information, Health misinformation, Public library, Rural public libraries, Vaccines and autism","Public libraries have adapted a variety of services into their institutional missions, including: promoting early literacy, publicly available Internet access, children's summer reading programs, and the dissemination of tax forms. Libraries are disproportionately rural institutions, often serving people with limited health care access. Thus, by public demand they have evolved to become important resources for rural health consumers to acquire information. Some public libraries have approached this role by subscribing to health databases, or by providing a link on their homepage to a health resource such as MedlinePlus, but most have undertaken little organizational change to meet growing patron demand.This body of research has attempted to understand the circumstances under which three consumer health efforts arose within or via public libraries, using two strands of inquiry to understand the process of patron health information provision. In the first strand, public libraries in rural Upstate New York were visited, observed and interviewed to understand how, and how well, health reference queries were handled. This assessment of practice was also conducted in a sample of visits in Delaware libraries. There were differing levels of staff knowledge of health information resources in all settings. In the second strand, three unique and dissimilar organizational models for consumer health information provision were studied, using institutional theory as a framework and employing a mixed methods approach.Consumer health provision efforts in Upstate New York and Delaware appear to have interacted in contrasting ways with the affiliated MLS librarians. In particular, print materials on library shelves were the most frequent source of outdated and questionable health information; in Delaware a heavier reliance on online resources led to more instances of authoritative resource provision. In all three examples studied, the perception that medical librarians were of a different sub-culture than public librarians arose and may have created impediments to program effectiveness and sustainability. These findings have implications for library practice, training, and instruction and point to a need for further understanding of the role of public libraries and library staff in providing health information in their communities."

The first essay draws on institutional theory to examine the history of corporate R&D; in the U.S. since the mid-19th century. Formal and informal institutional rules and constraints are shown to play a role in the initial rise of markets for technology in the 19th century, their decline during the early-20th century, and their eventual return at the end of the 20th century. The influence of formal and informal institutions on the adoption of in-house R&D; labs in the US during the mid-20th century is also examined.In the second essay, the focus shifts to an investigation of the discrete project-level R&D; outsourcing decision. A framework for understanding the direct and indirect influence of strategic considerations and environmental factors is developed. The impact of project- and transaction-level characteristics on the R&D; outsourcing decisions are also considered, highlighting the importance of integrating information possessed by managers from different levels of the firms. Finally, the second essay proposes that cross-level interactions may exist within the framework, which may help to explain why the decisions observed in some cases run counter to the predictions traditionally derived from theory.The third essay includes two empirical studies that examine different aspects of the contracts designed to govern R&D; alliances. Using a unique set of contracts from the medical device industry, the studies in the final essay investigate the factors that influence the structure of R&D; alliance contracts and the assignment of key decision and control rights in such contracts. In addition, the final essay investigates the impact of previous alliance experience on the relationship between the key factors identified and the structure of R&D; alliance contracts."
etd_490,The relationship of cognitive and affective factors with daily somatic complaints: An investigation into response expectancy theory and the symptom perception hypothesis,Psychology,"affect, expectancies, recall, somatic complaints, symptom","Theories explaining how psychological factors influence somatic complaints have existed for decades; however, few attempts have been made to integrate their predictions. Two such theories are the symptom perception hypothesis and the response expectancy theory. The symptom perception hypothesis suggests that negative affect influences daily somatic complaints, whereas the response expectancy theory surmises relationships with response expectancies. Neurological evidence suggest psychological factors such as these should be integrated to better understand daily somatic complaints. In line with this suggestion, this study aims to examine the combined effects of three psychological factors: namely state negative affect, response expectancies, and recollection of prior symptoms, in predicting daily somatic complaints. Using a sample of 95 college students alongside multilevel modelling, this study examined an integrated model of daily somatic complaints. Daily diary paradigms were used to measure state negative affect and daily somatic complaints. Response expectancies and recalled symptoms were measured as generalized constructs. Additionally, the interaction of state negative affect and response expectancies was examined. Results suggest an additive effect, as state negative affect, response expectancies, and recalled symptoms all predicted daily somatic complaints. The cross level interaction of expectancies and state negative affect was not significant. The results provide support for the coexistence of both the symptom perception hypothesis and response expectancy theory, as well as support for the integration of psychological factors."

Spirituality helps one to make meaning of life’s circumstances and can be an intrinsic motivator helping to regain balance in our world.  This study examined the relationship between spirituality, depression, and subjective well-being in 214 students enrolled in teachers’ colleges in Jamaica.  Researchers (Campbell, Roberti, Maynard & Emmanuel, 2009; Kameel & Kamal, 2011; Lipps, Lowe & Gibbons, 2004; Lowe, Lipps & Young, 2009) have documented depression as an issue for college students in Jamaica; however, studies have not yet included students enrolled in teachers’ colleges.  Additionally, there is scant research on spirituality and well-being in the Caribbean. This current study tested the extent to which spirituality moderated the relationship between self-reported depression on subjective well-being while controlling for demographic variables like year in college, denomination, and age. The study also tested whether spirituality mediated the relationship between self-reported depression and subjective well-being. All data were collected with self-report measures at a single point in time from a sample of college students. The results of the study supported that there was a significant relationship between depression and spiritual well-being and, between depression and subjective well-being. High levels of depression were related to increase spirituality and depression was found to be significantly related to subjective well-being. The mediation hypothesis was partially supported and the moderation hypothesis was not supported in this study. This study has both practice implication for college counselors to intentionally address spirituality in counseling, and for administrators to include sessions on spiritual exploration and development in the teacher education curriculum."

The low acceptability of divorce, negative attitudes toward divorce, as well as low national divorce rate are evident in China. Confucian family values, which have influenced Chinese education, moral and ethics for thousands of years, were hypothesized to have an impact on the phenomena based on the Theory of Reasoned Action. There were 289 Chinese college students recruited to participate in this study. The Filial Piety scale (Yeh, 2003), Collectivism scale (Chen & West, 2008), and Attitudes toward Divorce scale (Kinnaird & Gerrard, 1986) were used to measure Chinese filial piety values, family harmony values and attitudes toward divorce; Confucian Gender-Stereotyped Attitudes scale was designed in current study to examine Chinese gender-stereotyped attitudes. Although this study didn’t find that filial piety, family harmony and gender stereotypes comprise a single Confucian family values variable, these three constructs significantly independently predicted Chinese college students’ attitudes toward divorce. Other findings and limitations were discussed."

This is particularly salient for mothers who are overweight or obese, who have been shown to be more at risk for adverse postpartum outcomes than mothers who were of a normal weight before pregnancy. The current study examined the relationships between maternal stress, maternal depression, social support, maternal self-efficacy, maternal perceptions of child demandingness, and child social and emotional quality of life (as the outcome variable) in the two years after a second childbirth among a sample of overweight and obese women.  The subjects of this analysis were the mother-child dyad, specifically relating to the mother's perceptions of the `demandingness' of her older child (not the child to which the mother had recently given birth). This study was grounded in Bandura's theory of social cognition, and looked at the forces that converge to influence mother's perceptions of child social and emotional quality of life among a group of obese and overweight women approximately two years post childbirth.  This study was a secondary data analysis, and multiple regression analysis was used to determine what predicted perceptions of child social and emotional quality of life.  Results showed that maternal self-efficacy and maternal reports of child demandingness significantly predicted mother's report of  her child's social and emotional quality of life, with maternal reports of child demandingness emerging as a slightly stronger predictor.  Maternal depression, social support, and stress had far less predictive value. Clinicians may use the results from this study to more effectively work with overweight and obese mothers in the postpartum period who may struggle with negative perceptions of their children and child behavior problems."
psc_etd_112,The Risks of Outsourcing Security: Foreign Security Forces in United States National Security Policy,Political Science,"Constructivism, IR Theory, U.S. diplomatic history, U.S. foreign policy, U.S. national security policy","This study combines insights from international relations, diplomatic history, and civil-military relations to improve our understanding of the tenuous arrangement between the United States and its foreign military proxies. For over a century, the U.S. has armed and trained these proxies to assume responsibilities that its own military might otherwise have to bear. But throughout that time, critics have doubted whether the U.S. could or should delegate sensitive security responsibilities to ""dubious"" foreign soldiers. Such doubt highlights an international analog to the principal-agent problem normally associated with domestic civil-military relations. I examine why this international principal-agent problem arose, how it has evolved over the past century, and how this evolution has shifted the U.S.'s approach to bringing its foreign agents in line with its strategic objectives. From extensive archival research, I find that variation in this approach stems from changes in how the U.S., as the principal, has understood and characterized its security agents. To make sense of this finding, I advance constructivist principal-agent theory. This theory 1) reveals how the principal's evolving perception of its agent defines different bases of the principal-agent problem and 2) shows how each of these bases specifies particular policies--from among all those available--for mitigating that problem."
etd_695,"The Roberts Court Constitution of Freedom of Speech: Preferences, Principles, and the Study of Supreme Court Decision-making",Political Science,"Freedom of Speech, Judicial Decisionmaking, Multi-method Research","Since the appointment of Chief Justice G. Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court, political scientists and legal scholars have assessed the Court’s behavior in a diverse array of cases and issue areas, including those touching on federalism, reproductive rights, voting rights, and economic liberty (cases involving businesses and corporations). Few issues have proven as vexing as the Court’s constitution of the First Amendment’s command “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech…”In light of the Court’s ongoing constitution of the scope and coverage of the First Amendment, a narrative has emerged that paints the Court as distinctly conservative. In a number of widely publicized, controversial decisions, the Court under Chief Justice Roberts has incrementally dismantled federal and state efforts at campaign finance reform, made union fundraising more difficult, and restricted the availability of First Amendment protection for students, prisoners, and government employees. This explanation, however intuitive and prevalent, is complicated by another narrative. During the same period, the Court has issued incredibly speech-protective decisions in cases involving the distribution of videos depicting dog fights, violence in videogames, protesters at the funerals of fallen service members, lying about military awards, NGOs working abroad to address the AIDS epidemic, roadside signage, and even government employees. Adding another wrinkle to the fold is entire corpus of anti-speech claimant decisions that have been issued by a unanimous Court, or a Court divided in a way unexpected by the ‘liberals versus conservatives’ characterization of our nation’s highest tribunal.These dual storylines present a puzzle that motivate a set of interrelated research questions: What is the nature of the Roberts Court’s constitution of freedom of expression? Is judicial behavior within this politically salient issue area explained by the ideological preferences or attitudes of the justices? If not, what is the alternative explanation? And, more broadly, what are the limitations of the conventional means by which scholars study judicial behavior? This dissertation explores these questions through a set of conventional and innovative approaches to the study of judicial decision-making. It examines the entire universe of free speech decisions of the Roberts Court from external and internal approaches to the study of judicial decision-making. To do so, the dissertation employs a multi-method approach, including large and medium-N analyses of Roberts Court free speech decisions and qualitative tools of conceptual development and process tracing.This project offers four key findings related to the effect of judicial attitudes on the constitution of protection for freedom of expression during the Roberts Era. First, as indicators have incrementally improved upon accurately measuring a key concept of interest – the ideological direction of decisions in freedom of expression cases – the bivariate relationship between judicial attitudes and ideological voting becomes more tenuous. This suggests the need for a continuing research program focused on conceptually valid operationalization of decision direction in freedom of expression cases and beyond. Second, with the Rehnquist Court Era as a comparison point, the effect of judicial attitudes across all votes during the Roberts Era is statistically significant – stronger conservatism scores correlate positively with a pro-speech decision. While this relationship does not exist for the Rehnquist Court, a conceptual typology of cases comparing the ordering of voting coalitions to the direction of decisions in those cases reveals that the Roberts Court is, in some ways, less ideological than the Rehnquist Court Era. Third, through the tool of process tracing and the use of “hoop tests,” the Roberts Court is best understood as having a conservative orientation though not monolithically so – there is considerable heterogeneity in terms of the ideological orientation and conceptions of the judicial role held by the justices that frequently result in unexpected voting alignments. Fourth, the Court’s certiorari process in free expression controversies is better explained by jurisprudential concerns rather than ideological cues. However, once disaggregating the Court’s certiorari docket by issue area, there is evidence for both the ideological and legal explanations for the Court’s behavior in free expression decisions.The broader finding wrought from this project is that the judicial constitution of contemporary free expression protection in the U.S. cannot be reduced to single-cause explanations. The complex and often secret nature of various stages of judicial decision-making at the US Supreme Court, as well as the competing, longstanding epistemological approaches to understanding judicial behavior, strongly suggests that scholars must take care to question the assumptions of and examine behavior from both “internal” and “external” perspectives on Court behavior. Sacrificing the former at the altar of the latter leaves interested observers without a clear idea of the structure and language through which high politics is contested at the Court – a language that makes some claims possible and others untenable. The reverse is also problematic: Taking the justices at their word and assuming that fidelity to legal principles and sincerely-held conceptions of the judicial role explains judicial behavior ignores what appear to be patterns of partisan or ideologically driven voting. Beyond answering a substantive question of great interest for scholars, lawyers, litigants, and citizens alike, this research presents new directions for the study of judicial decision-making that have great potential for traveling to other issue areas and constitutional courts Syracuse University."
etd_23,"The Role of Ethical Evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility in the Perception of Corporate Hypocrisy, the Intention of Opinioned Communication and Behavior toward a Firm",Mass Communications,"Business ethics, Corporate communication, Corporate social responsibility, International PR, Issues management, Public relations","Corporate hypocrisy refers to publics' negative perception of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) as a result of ethical attribution of CSR to normative ethics, and thus can be a useful indicator of the disappointing and ineffective role of CSR programs geared toward raising publics' goodwill toward a firm. However, scant scholarly effort has been made to explore the concept of corporate hypocrisy in relation to corporate issues and crises, publics' ethical orientation, cultural and national influence, and polarized sentiments toward global business in the media landscape. These aspects collectively constitute the unpredictable, uncontrollable public opinion, in particular the opinion of the socially minded general public, and these aspects thus generate a turbulent business arena across the globe.To fill this void, this dissertation concurrently conducted two sets of research: one used a survey methodology on a real company's CSR case and the other used an experimental method. First, Study 1 aimed to investigate how the perception of corporate hypocrisy connects publics' ethical attribution of CSR to subsequent positive/negative opinioned communication intention and pro-firm behavioral intention. With special attention to deontology and consequentialism in normative ethics of philosophy, the current study was to empirically test a theoretical model of perceived corporate hypocrisy with two causal antecedents (i.e., the evaluation of self-orientation and other-orientation in CSR), and the mediating role of corporate hypocrisy between such antecedents and subsequent publics' communication and behavioral intention toward a firm. Personal ethical orientation was suggested to moderate effects of corporate hypocrisy on dependent measures. Moreover, to explore the cultural and national effect in the theoretical model, this study compared U.S. and Korean data. To this end, a survey using a real company CSR case was conducted via Internet with a convenient sample (n = 603; the U.S.=406, Korea=256), including the general population (n=456) and a Northeastern university's student and alumni population (n=147).Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to empirically test the hypothesized mediation model of corporate hypocrisy. The results indicate several key issues regarding the role of ethics on the strategic CSR communication. First, this study found sound measurement reliability and validity of the proposed four-item scale of four dimensions in ethical CSR evaluation (i.e., self-interested motives, self-interested outcomes, altruistic motives and altruistic outcomes). Further, this study also proposed a self-developed seven-item scales for deontology and consequentialism with acceptable reliability and validity as indicators of personal ethical orientation in the context of public's ethical judgment of global business practices. The current study also found significant mediation effects of corporate hypocrisy between ethical CSR evaluation and publics' communication and behavioral intention based on positive and negative opinions formed through CSR evaluation. Also, as assumed, personal ethical orientation and cultural/national difference were found to significantly moderate the role of corporate hypocrisy on dependent measures.Study 2 aimed to test the theoretical validity of the attitudinal and behavioral influence of personal ethical orientation (i.e., deontology vs. consequentialism) and media framing of CSR approach (i.e., self-oriented CSR vs. other-oriented CSR); an experiment study (n=603) was conducted online for study 2. For the U.S. samples, the university student and alumni population was recruited (n= 347), and for the Korean samples, the general population (n=256) was recruited via an online survey system. Study 2 also found significant effects of personal ethical orientation and media framing. Deontological publics were more influenced by media framing of CSR approach rather tha n consequentialist publics; more significant was the differing interaction effect across nationalities. The Korean samples were more prone to be affected by media framing of CSR approach depending on their ethical orientation than the U.S. samples.To summarize, across the findings of the two studies, deontological publics showed more ethically idealistic and rigorous traits whereas consequentialist publics displayed a more pragmatic and business-friendly inclination in CSR judgment. This result highlighted the role of virtue ethics perceived from corporate motives and outcomes of CSR, which can play a part in forming publics which have certain opinions toward global business and its CSR activities. Also, the findings indicated that these ethical traits can be related to the cultural and national background of publics targeted in the global market; thus CSR strategy should take the ethical and cultural traits of target publics into account. Limitations and suggestions for future research were discussed with implications for both public relations scholarship and practices."
bce_etd_64,The Role of Fluorescence and Human Factors in Quantitative Transdermal Blood and Tissue Analysis Using NIR Raman Spectroscopy,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), Hematocrit (Hct), Human Factors, Noninvasive In Vivo, Photobleaching, Raman Spectroscopy","This research is part of an ongoing project aimed at the application of combined near infrared (NIR) Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy to noninvasive in vivo blood analysis including but not limited to glucose monitoring. Coping with practicalities of human factors and exploring ways to obtain and use knowledge gained about autofluorescence to improve algorithms for blood and tissue analysis are the general goals of this research. Firstly, the study investigated the various sources of human factors pertinent to our concerns, such as fingerprints, turgor, skin hydration and pigmentation. We then introduced specialized in vivo apparatus including means for precise and reproducible placement of the tissues relative to the optical aperture, i.e., the position detector pressure monitor (PDPM). Based on solid instrumental performances, appropriate methodology is now provided for applying and maintaining pressure to keep surface tissues immobile during experiments while obtaining the desired blood content and flow. Secondly, in vivo human fingertip skin autofluorescence photobleaching under 200 mW 830 nm NIR irradiation is observed and it is characterized that: i) the majority of the photobleached fluorescence originates from static tissue not blood, ii) the bleaching (1/e point) occurs in 101-102 sec timescale, and also iii) a photobleached region remains bleached for at least 45 min but recovers completely within several hours. A corresponding extensive but not exhaustive in vitro systematic study narrowed down the major contributors of such fluorescence and bleaching to collagen, melanin, plasma and hemoglobin: two major static tissue constituents and two major blood proteins. Thirdly, we established that measuring the inelastic and elastic emissions simultaneously leads to a sensitive probe for volume changes of both red blood cells and plasma. An algorithm based on measurements obtained while performing research needed for this thesis, as well as some empirical calibration approaches, was presented. The calibrated algorithm showed real potential to track hematocrit variations in cardiac pulses, centrifugal loading, blood vessel blockage using tourniquet, and even during as subtle an occurrence as in a Valsalva maneuver. Finally, NIR fluorescence and photochemistry of pentosidine, a representative of the advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) which accumulate with age and hyperglycemia, was studied. The results indicate that oxygen plays a pivotal role in its photobleaching process. We hypothesized and offered proofs showing that pentosidine is a 1O2 sensitizer that is also subject to attack by the 1O2 resulting in the photobleaching that is observed when probing tissue using NIR. The photobleaching reaction is kinetically first order in pentosidine and ground state oxygen, and in vivo effectively first order with NIR irradiation also."
etd_573,The Role of ICTs in Social Movements: The Case of the Honduran National Front Against the 2009 Coup,School of Information Studies,"Alternative Systems, Honduras, ICTs, Improvisation, Politics, Social Movements","There is an important academic conversation happening about how social movements adopt, use, and configure Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for political participation. This dissertation contributes to that conversation by taking a holistic look at ICTs, throughout a social movement's emergence and development, while considering its context, its organizational structures and sense-making processes.I explore the case of the Honduran National Front Against the Coup (NFAC), a relevant case due to its similarities with other movements, like the use of social media, the support from the international community and its geographically dispersed networks; but also, particular in its political and ICT context.Guided by the Contentious Politics Model (CPM) asked an overarching research question: What is the role of Information and Communication Technologies in the emergence and development of the National Front Against the Coup?I also asked three second-level questions: (1) How does the Honduran Resistance Movement relate ICTs to political Opportunity Structures? (2) What role do ICTs play in creating and supporting the movement's organizational structures, and in preparing and carrying out visible movement episodes? (3) How does the NFAC use ICTs to shape its attitudes, identities and competences?I conducted a single embedded exploratory case study guided by the extended case method where I studied the NFAC in a sequence of interconnected time periods called Collective Action Framing Episodes (CAFEs). Data were reconstructive narratives from primary and secondary sources.The movement's use of ICTs for mobilizing social support for their cause can be considered an improvised subversive response to the institutionalized political environment.The movement's regional affiliates formed a loosely coupled extended organization, which allowed the affiliates a degree of autonomy to do their oppositional work while remaining fully aligned with the movement's priorities. ICTs allowed the movement to broadcast its messages across the network to ""socialize"" the affiliates and ensure they were all on the same page.  This lose confederation, coordinated through ICTs allowed the NFAC to dynamically reconfigure and rearrange its regional affiliates as needed.I found instances of resourcefulness and improvisation, both in the way individual media platforms were used, and in the way these platforms were combined and recombined to move ahead.Thus, the intellectual contribution of this study is twofold: The first one is an expansion of the CPM (Contentious Politics Model). I propose that ICTs don't drive revolutions, but neither are they simply tools. There is a dynamic relation as environmental conditions (OS) like policies, institutions, ICT ownership, media centralization, shape the way social movements configure ICTs, and ICTs configurations by social movements can influence environmental conditions. The same way ICT configurations can be determined by he availability, collaboration and connectedness of civil society organizations within the movement (MS), and their relations can be influenced by ICT configurations. Therefore, by playing a reflexive role in the process of frame creation, ICTs are embedded in every level of the social movement emergence and development.The second contribution is an operative framework and analytical tool to study the interactions between social movements, institutions, and ICTs. The model uses CAFEs (Collective Action Framing Episodes), a composed construct that allows integrating several levels of analysis into one unit of analysis."
etd_715,THE ROLE OF RESIDENTIAL COMMUNIIES FOR THE ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL SUCCESS OF UNDERGRADUATE WOMEN IN STEM MAJORS: THE CASE OF A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN ETHIOPIA,Teaching and Leadership,"Academic Integration, College Residence, Living Learning Programs, Social Integration, STEM, Women","This study is an exploratory case study which explored the residential environment of an Ethiopian public university on its role for the social and academic integration of undergraduate women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. It also explained how the social and academic integration of the women contributed for their overall college success.There were three groups of participants; undergraduate women in STEM, female resident proctors, and relevant officials from the university and the Ministry of Education of the Ethiopian government. Each of the participants were interviewed on a one-on-one basis and the interviews were transcribed and coded for the analysis. Supportive quantitative data about the enrollment, performance and retention of students were also gathered from the university's registrar office and analyzed quantitatively to support the qualitative data obtained through interviews. The study was framed by Tinto’s Integration Model and data were interpreted using Third World feminist theory.The findings showed that due to the fact that all same-sex, same-major women living in the same rooms, and all who live in one dorm take similar courses throughout their program, and dormitories serving multiple roles, including being collaboration spaces, played a big role for better social and academic integration of the women. It is also found that their social and academic integration helped them to better perform in their majors by enhancing their sense of belonging in the male-dominated STEM majors, enhancing their commitment, and promoting peer encouragement. On the other hand, the findings also showed that there were some factors which have negative influence in the integration process such as negative stereotypes against the presence and good performance of women in STEM, lack of support system, and limited interaction with faculty. So, the study recommends that working on improving the negatively influencing factors will enhance the positive impact the resident environment is bringing for the success of undergraduate women in STEM in the university studied."

These can be used in many high performance applications such as medical imaging, computational biology and video image processing. The Rootbeer GPU Compiler is a system that enables these processors to be used from the Java Programming Language. The system is the only system including support for Java Programming Language features such as methods, fields and objects. It includes a high performance throughput API that offers faster performance than the competitor Aparapi and contains a complete API to use CUDA primitives from Rootbeer including atomic integers, shared memory, threadfence and syncthreads. To obtain maximum performance while programming a GPU, the developer should experiment with thread count, block count, shared memory	size	and	register count. These aspects of programming are all configurable while using Rootbeer and we show in examples that tuning these leads to improved performance. This dissertation explains GPU programming and describes the internal structure of the Rootbeer GPU Compiler along with additions to the Soot Java	 Optimization	 Framework and several examples demonstrating performance speedups. We show an example from computational biology of using Hidden Markov Model learning and likelihood calculation which Rootbeer can accelerate 102.7x with an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 device. In the final concluding remarks we give recommendations for supporting Java on GPUs to NVIDIA and Oracle for an industrial setting."
etd_719,THE SCALABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE BINARY CODE SEARCH AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Binary Analysis, Machine Learning, Memory Forensics, Software Security, Vulnerability Search","The past decade has been witnessing an explosion of various applications and devices.This big-data era challenges the existing security technologies: new analysis techniquesshould be scalable to handle “big data” scale codebase; They should be become smartand proactive by using the data to understand what the vulnerable points are and wherethey locate; effective protection will be provided for dissemination and analysis of the datainvolving sensitive information on an unprecedented scale.In this dissertation, I argue that the code search techniques can boost existing securityanalysis techniques (vulnerability identification and memory analysis) in terms of scalability and accuracy. In order to demonstrate its benefits, I address two issues of code search by using the code analysis: scalability and accountability. I further demonstrate the benefit of code search by applying it for the scalable vulnerability identification [57] and thecross-version memory analysis problems [55, 56].Firstly, I address the scalability problem of code search by learning “higher-level” semanticfeatures from code [57]. Instead of conducting fine-grained testing on a single deviceor program, it becomes much more crucial to achieve the quick vulnerability scanningin devices or programs at a “big data” scale. However, discovering vulnerabilities in “bigcode” is like finding a needle in the haystack, even when dealing with known vulnerabilities. This new challenge demands a scalable code search approach. To this end, I leverage successful techniques from the image search in computer vision community and propose a novel code encoding method for scalable vulnerability search in binary code. The evaluation results show that this approach can achieve comparable or even better accuracy and efficiency than the baseline techniques.Secondly, I tackle the accountability issues left in the vulnerability searching problemby designing vulnerability-oriented raw features [58]. The similar code does not alwaysrepresent the similar vulnerability, so it requires that the feature engineering for the codesearch should focus on semantic level features rather than syntactic ones. I propose toextract conditional formulas as higher-level semantic features from the raw binary code toconduct the code search. A conditional formula explicitly captures two cardinal factorsof a vulnerability: 1) erroneous data dependencies and 2) missing or invalid conditionchecks. As a result, the binary code search on conditional formulas produces significantlyhigher accuracy and provides meaningful evidence for human analysts to further examinethe search results. The evaluation results show that this approach can further improvethe search accuracy of existing bug search techniques with very reasonable performanceoverhead.Finally, I demonstrate the potential of the code search technique in the memory analysisfield, and apply it to address their across-version issue in the memory forensic problem[55, 56]. The memory analysis techniques for COTS software usually rely on theso-called “data structure profiles” for their binaries. Construction of such profiles requiresthe expert knowledge about the internal working of a specified software version. However,it is still a cumbersome manual effort most of time. I propose to leverage the code searchtechnique to enable a notion named “cross-version memory analysis”, which can update aprofile for new versions of a software by transferring the knowledge from the model thathas already been trained on its old version. The evaluation results show that the code search based approach advances the existing memory analysis methods by reducing themanual efforts while maintaining the reasonable accuracy. With the help of collaborators, Ifurther developed two plugins to the Volatility memory forensic framework [2], and showthat each of the two plugins can construct a localized profile to perform specified memoryforensic tasks on the same memory dump, without the need of manual effort in creating the corresponding profile."
etd_338,The Self-Assembly of Peptides to Create Catalysts,Chemistry,,"Enzymes are extremely powerful tools essential for all human life. Enzymes are usually comprised of hundreds of amino acids and rely on well-defined secondary structure for function. While short peptides do not normally adopt well-defined secondary structure, they have the potential to be good models for enzymes. The objective of this research is to use the self-assembly of short peptides into stable structures through thermodynamic potentials to create new catalysts.Hydrolytic metallobinding enzymes are abundant in nature. A library of peptides that mimic the structure of these enzymes was created from minimalistic principles. The resulting peptides can bind Zn2+ through coordination to histidine residues. Zn2+ can modulate the pKa of a coordinated water molecule to create a nucleophile for a particular reaction. A variety of reactions ranging from the hydrolysis of simple esters to complex phosphoesters and amino acids are assayed. The hydroxide anion attacks the ester carbonyl to form the products.Characterization of the peptides show that they self-assemble into stable ?-amyloid fibril aggregates. The results show that the designed peptides can successfully catalyze the hydrolysis of esters with activity on par with state of the art computationally designed proteins. The activity of the peptides requires self-assembly in the presence of metal ions as shown by Transmission Electron Microscopy and fluorescence assays with dyes known to bind to amyloid fibrils.By mixing multiple peptides many different coordination sphere environments are probed at once. This creates an essentially limitless number of combinations. Through these techniques it is successfully proven that the designed peptides can self-assemble in the presence of metal ions and it is the metal-containing peptide assemblies that are responsible for catalyzing ester hydrolysis."
etd_560,"The Social Construction of Reading-Related ""Response to Intervention"" In One Primary School",Reading and Language Arts,"educational policy, reading instruction, Response to Intervention, RTI, school change, transformative leadership","The purpose of this study was to explore how individuals in one primary school enacted and understood a new mandate called Response to Intervention, or “RTI.”  More specifically, it asked:  1) How was the RTI mandate interpreted and realized by the school?  2) In what ways was reading instruction addressed during RTI implementation? 3) How did individuals view their responsibilities and involvement with RTI?This qualitative study was rooted in social constructionism (Berger & Luckman, 1966; Burr, 2003), a theory that views knowledge of reality as unfixed and shaped by the language and actions of individuals in contextualized, situated perspectives.  Seventeen participants volunteered for this study, which used in-depth interviews, participant observations, and locally created documents as data sources.  Data analysis also drew upon the notion of marginalization of students with learning differences (Beglieri, Bejoain, Broderick, Connor, & Valle, 2011; Ferri, 2011; Lalvani, 2015; Nordmann, 2001) and Banks’s (2003) ideas about additive, versus transformative, approaches to educational change.Analysis of data sources revealed that Response to Intervention was enacted within and between existing school structures and practices in a way that can be described as additive (Banks, 2003).  That is, some new components were added to what was already in place, without a fundamental shift in the beliefs underlying existing structures and practices.  Approaches to reading instruction did not appear to change during Response to Intervention implementation in this school.  It is argued that without changes to instruction, there are unlikely to be changes in reading outcomes for students.  This may begin to help explain the findings of a national study of RTI effectiveness conducted by Balu, Zhu, Doolittle, Schiller, Jenkins, and Gersten (2015).  The authors of the large-scale study concluded that RTI, as implemented in the United States, has yet to have positive effects, and sometimes had negative effects, on student reading achievement.Analysis also revealed that despite Response to Intervention’s intent to reduce the placing of special education labels on children, it was enacted in a way that created a new label – “RTI.”  An RTI teacher was hired to deliver RTI services to the RTI students.  This new labeling may be seen as stigmatizing, thereby perpetuating the marginalization of some students who struggle with learning to read and undermining collective responsibility for the reading success of all students in schools.This study provides new insights about what happens when well-intended educational mandates come from the top down.  It shows how such mandates may be socially constructed in actual schools with pre-existing underlying beliefs, structures, and practices that may be incongruent with the new initiative.  This study points to a need for more up-close research that explores the enactment of educational mandates in schools.  The findings also suggest a need for more specific guidance within legislation to support schools as they implement mandates, and, as a result, have implications for teacher and administrator education and practice."

In this work the solid state DFT modeling was accomplished using the CRYSTAL09 code to simulate the geometries and vibrational modes of a variety of systems. These studies included: (1) the investigation of three polymorphs of vanadium phosphate, (2) three studies involving the use of 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole, and lastly (3) the crystal structure and simulation of ?,?,?’,?’-tetrabromo-p-xylene. The studies involving 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole are comprised of (a) the comparison of a new polymorph to previously published crystallographic information of the free base 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole, (b) the comparison of two hydrohalide salts of 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole, and lastly, (c) comparing three isomorphous transition metal complexes with 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole as a ligand.In the majority of these systems, with the exception of the polymorphs of vanadium phosphate, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy was used to probe the intermolecular interactions in these molecular crystals. These studies aim to increase the understanding of what effect subtle structural, compositional, or packing differences have on the vibrational normal modes, in particular in the region from 0-100 cm-1 known as the terahertz region.It was found that subtle differences in the structure, composition, or packing could have large and varying effects on the vibrational modes, especially in the terahertz region. In particular, there are no universal trends in the shifting of vibrational frequency; however, the nature of the normal mode has the greatest effect when comparing systems that have compositional differences."

From its publication, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care in 1946 received immensely positive reactions from readers with its unbreakable sales record, next to the Bible. But, at the same time, especially in the 1960s onward, Spock’s advice was stigmatized as permissive by the conservatives and oppressive and male-dominated by feminists. Considering this, this dissertation focuses on a central paradoxical trait of Spock’s childrearing advice, his seemingly permissive approach toward control through a new psychology, which actually represented a new mode of control. It explores this paradox by paying particular attention to the question of how Spock developed his ideal of raising a proper citizen through his concept of self-control. By changing the basis for self-control, his advice supported the idea of a new form of control to be strengthened by means of more internalized and elaborate guidelines. Calling into question the existing belief that Spock’s methods of control were looser and more lenient, this study examines the patterns of transformation in his child rearing ideas from authoritative and visible controls to subtle and internal controls in the mid-twentieth century. Based on this, this dissertation argues that these paradoxical aspects in Spock’s childrearing idea might have acted as catalysts to lay the groundwork for a passage to a more self-centered moral norm in the therapeutic culture."
busad_etd_95,The Struggle for Power and Pay: Implications of Board of Directors' Power on Monitoring Effectiveness and Pay for Performance Sensitivity,Business Administration,"Board of Directors, CEO, Corporate Governance, Executive Compensation, Monitoring, Power","Boards of directors monitor and incentivize CEOs to make decisions that maximize shareholder value; however, research has been inconsistent in identifying the relationship between board composition and monitoring effectiveness (Daily, Johnson, Ellstrand, & Dalton, 1998). Integrating an economic perspective (agency theory) with a socio-psychological perspective (upper echelon theory), this paper examines how outsiders' and insiders' power bases relate to pay-for-performance by proposing and empirically examining a multi-dimensional model of board power bases: ownership, prestige, and structural. I argue that board structural and composition characteristics can be used as proxy indicators of board power. Using data from 37, 066 directors of 950 firms resulting in 3,581 firm-year observations between 2000-2006, I find the ratio of the average outsider's prestige power to insiders' associates positively with total compensation and pay-for-performance sensitivity in partial support of my hypothesis. Although contrary to my expectations, I find the ratios of the average outsiders' ownership and structural power bases to insiders' are insignificantly associated with pay-for-performance, supplemental analysis reveals that these relationships become significant as context changes. Thus, I extend my theoretical framework to the role of context in the board power and monitoring effectiveness relationship; specifically, I conceptualize context in terms of environmental (e.g., government regulation, world events, institutional pressures), firm (e.g., size and performance), board (e.g., size, level of board independence), and CEO (e.g., ownership and tenure) characteristics. Overall, this study contributes to research by illustrating that board power is relevant to monitoring effectiveness; however, this relationship is contextual."
etd_204,The Sundial Tribe and the Labyrinth of Purpose,Philosophy,"evolution, formal semantics, language, philosophy of biology, teleological function, truth","I propose solutions to three problems of increasing specificity: naturalizing teleological functions; the semantics of natural language as embedded in context; and the meaning of linguistic expressions of disagreement about personal taste.The concept of teleological function spans multiple domains---biologically evolved traits; intentional states such as beliefs and desires; actions; artifacts; customs, traditions, and institutions; social groups; and words, speech acts, and grammatical structures. When we ascribe a teleological function---e.g., the evolved function of the eye to aid sight, or the technological function of aspirin to reduce fever---we explain not only how a thing ought to function, but also why that thing exists. This is why, on the most popular contemporary theory of teleological function, the etiological theory (Millikan, Neander, etc.), the teleological functions of things are determined by the way these things came to exist: for actions and for many artifacts, intentional causation; for biological traits, evolution by natural selection.This latter clause, however, has been shown to falsely exclude genuine teleological functions. To solve the difficulty I replace the standard requirement---for full-blown natural selection---with a different Darwinian requirement---for past contribution to the homestates of the systems that generated the bearers of teleological functions. In the sphere of biology, such generating systems include a trait's organism, this organism's ancestors and development, and natural selection itself. The kind of states I call homestates, well-known from cybernetics, are states that a system is disposed to reach from diverse initial conditions and in spite of a range of perturbations. For instance, the homestate of a target-seeking missile is to meet its target. I argue that the approach generalizes beyond biology to all teleological functions. When an entity x has the teleological function to cause E, this is in virtue of the fact that the causal explanation of x's origin places x under a norm to cause E and thereby to contribute to the homestates of x's generators.Just like biological traits, utterances often perform their teleological functions in ways that rely on their environments, i.e., on their linguistic contexts. In light of this, I develop an externalist semantic view that I call mindless contextualism, the view that utterances embedded in context can semantically represent unintended constituents, i.e., that they can express propositions that go beyond the speakers' intentions. Imagine, for instance, that the members of the Sundial tribe migrate eastward and westward, that they tell the time only by sundials, and thus that they never become aware that the same hours come at different times in different places. Despite all this, they can still successfully and truthfully communicate about hours of day by saying such things as, ""We dine at7 everywhere we go.""I position mindless contextualism within the contemporary debate between contextualism and relativism, and I argue that truth is not relative and that many of the phenomena commonly taken as arguments for relativism are, instead, signs of the presence of unintended constituents. I apply this approach to the problem of disagreement in matters of personal taste, a problem often used in the literature to model truth relativism, and I show how we can solve the problem in a way compatible with non-relative truth."

DSSCs require incident photon energy in the visible spectrum for the cell to produce a usable current. While the possibility of absorbing twonear-infrared photons is a known concept for surmounting the SQ limit, the opportunities presented by mesoporous systems for creating such a sensitizer do not appear to have been studied. By incorporating carborane cluster-based macrocyclic compounds as ""electron reservoirs,"" a number of the inherent limitations in DSSC systems can be potentially circumvented, including extending the useable photon energy into the IR region by using a multi-photon, multi-step mechanism, effectively surmounting the SQ limit.Chapter 2: Recent experiments with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have shownsuccessful covalent and non-covalent functionalization of these nanostructures. Furthermore, experiments have also shown that the non-covalent functionalization of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) with polythiophene can produce a working photovoltaic device when attached to TiO2 nanoparticles as a semiconductor in a manner similar to a DSSC. This paper explores the characterizations of a new polythiophene-BNNS complex, as well as attempting to stabilize and functionalize BNNS with thiophene based monomers."

Specifically, through this project I examined the development of a sustainable inclusive education system in western Kenya through community-based participatory research (CBPR) and critical disability studies (CDS). Through three cycles of qualitative interviews with a variety of stakeholders in inclusive education, participants explained what they saw as foundational components of how to create more inclusive primary school classrooms utilizing existing school and community resources. With a qualitative approach to data analysis (e.g., grounded theory) informed by CBPR and decolonizing methods, participant responses comprised the data I recorded and analyzed. These data illuminated the creativity, resourcefulness, and resiliency the stakeholders used daily to mitigate systemic disability oppression as it related to inclusive education. Both CBPR and CDS approaches to this project offered participants frameworks to collectively trace the historical events that created the current segregated education system in Kenya, allowed them to identify disability rights-based alternatives to special schools, and to develop inclusive practices based on joint inclusion committee decisions. Through this research, I offer alternative views on inclusive education in the global South. Rather than constructing Kenya as one of many “poor” countries in Africa consistently in need of help from the global North, I argue that the severely under-resourced educational realities in Kenya have created resourceful and resilient inclusive stakeholders in education whose approaches to community-based disability rights advocacy have transformative potential in the global North. I hope this dissertation offers educators and CDS scholars tangible starting points from which to begin similar work in other under-resourced regions of the world."
geo_etd_79,"The Territorialization of the 'Republican Law': Judicial Presence in Seine-Saint-Denis, France",Geography,"judiciary, Paris, presence, territorialization, urban, violence","This dissertation investigates the presence of the courts in the spaces of everyday life in social housing estates located in Seine-Saint-Denis (northeast of Paris). Since the 1990s the judiciary has actively sponsored the territorialization of the courts (la territorialisation de la Justice) as the most adept measure to respond to a series of problems often understood as essentially ""local"": crime, revolts, ""incivilities,"" and insecurity. The dissertation examines the proliferation of new judicial structures in crime-prone areas, and the increasing involvement of judges in local partnerships to more efficiently fight crime and prevent collective violence among youths from immigrant origins. More specifically, the Houses of Justice and Law, or Maisons de Justice et du droit, and the Local Groups for the Treatment of Delinquency, or Groupes Locaux du Traitement de la Delinquance (GLTD), in Seine-Saint-Denis are analyzed in order to demonstrate the increasing role of the judiciary in the production of urban space.Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews with local officials, policy documents, newspaper articles, and secondary sources the dissertation argues that the spatial reorganization of the judicial system reflects the state's necessity to be physically present in the everyday lives of the population of social housing estates. This physical presence, in turn, allows the French state to re-assert its authority and reclaim its legitimacy in places that continually challenge it. Moreover, the objective of the dissertation is to explain why that is so, how it has gone about becoming present, and what that means for the everyday lives of (""immigrant"") youth of housing estates.The dissertation contributes to state theories in the geographic literature by stressing that present-day state theories tend to accentuate the spatial reorganization of contemporary states according to the demands of capital accumulation. However, the dissertation argues that due attention is given to the construction of new penal spaces as these are becoming important sites where states exert their contested authority and expand their geographies of power. More specifically, the dissertation contributes to debates on the penal state by focusing attention to the territorialization of the courts rather than the police who have received significant attention in geographic debates. In other words, the dissertation seeks to depict the judiciary as a territorial institution, a point seldom highlighted in the social sciences."

This was done by examining the structure of ethnic identity from a Ukrainian-American perspective in terms of language fluency, ritualistic expression and religiosity and then by examining the processes by which this identity is formed in the context of the family. In addition, the complementary role of ethnic community and parenting approaches was examined. 414 participants (207 dyads) were recruited from the Ukrainian-Cultural Centers and CYM: Ukrainian-American Youth Association throughout Upstate New York. Findings revealed the transmission of religiosity, Ukrainian and American ethnic from parent to offspring, as well as transmission of parenting styles. Ukrainian ethnic identity positively predicted authoritarian beliefs and negatively predicted permissive beliefs for parents and offspring.  Ethnic identity did not predict authoritative beliefs for parents or offspring. Psychological sense of community moderated the transmission of ethnic identity from parent to offspring such that adult offspring were most impacted by community involvement when their parents’ ethnic identity was low. The results of this research demonstrate the importance of mutual and complementary systems in determining the processes by which ethnic identity is maintained in an acculturating community."
etd_167,The Unified-FFT Method for Fast Solution of Integral Equations as Applied to Shielded-Domain Electromagnetics,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Computational Electromagnetics, Computational Methods, Fast Algorithms, Fast Methods, Method of Moments, Numerical Electromagnetics","Electromagnetic (EM) solvers are widely used within computer-aided design (CAD) to improve and ensure success of circuit designs. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of Maxwell's equations, they are often computationally expensive. While considerable progress has been made in the realm of speed-enhanced EM solvers, these fast solvers generally achieve their results through methods that introduce additional error components by way of geometric approximations, sparse-matrix approximations, multilevel decomposition of interactions, and more. This work introduces the new method, Unified-FFT (UFFT). A derivative of method of moments, UFFT scales as O(N log N), and achieves fast analysis by the unique combination of FFT-enhanced matrix fill operations (MFO) with FFT-enhanced matrix solve operations (MSO).In this work, two versions of UFFT are developed, UFFT-Precorrected (UFFT-P) and UFFT-Grid Totalizing (UFFT-GT). UFFT-P uses precorrected FFT for MSO and allows the use of basis functions that do not conform to a regular grid. UFFT-GT uses conjugate gradient FFT for MSO and features the capability of reducing the error of the solution down to machine precision. The main contribution of UFFT-P is a fast solver, which utilizes FFT for both MFO and MSO. It is demonstrated in this work to not only provide simulation results for large problems considerably faster than state of the art commercial tools, but also to be capable of simulating geometries which are too complex for conventional simulation. In UFFT-P these benefits come at the expense of a minor penalty to accuracy.UFFT-GT contains further contributions as it demonstrates that such a fast solver can be accurate to numerical precision as compared to a full, direct analysis. It is shown to provide even more algorithmic efficiency and faster performance than UFFT-P. UFFT-GT makes an additional contribution in that it is developed not only for planar geometries, but also for the case of multilayered dielectrics and metallization. This functionality is particularly useful for multi-layered printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, UFFT-GT contributes a 3D planar solver, which allows for current to be discretized in the z-direction. This allows for similar fast and accurate simulation with the inclusion of some 3D features, such as vias connecting metallization planes."
etd_160,Theoretical investigation of the quantum-confined Stark effect,Chemistry,"electron-hole correlation length, excited electronic states, explicitly correlated wave functions, ligand-induced quantum-confined Stark effect, quantum-confined Stark effect, quantum dots","The two main objectives of this dissertation are the systematic development of explicitly correlated electron-hole wave function based methods and the application of these methods to chemical systems with anemphasis on nanoparticles.The understanding of the basic physics of excited electronic states is an important consideration when developing new methods and applications. In this dissertation, excited electronic states were studied using the electron-hole quasiparticle representation. Theoretical treatment of electronic excitation in large quantum dots and nanoparticles is challenging because of the large number of electrons in the system. The quasiparticle representation provides an alternative representation that can partially alleviate the computational bottleneck associated with investigating these systems. However, in this representation, the effects of electron-hole correlation must be understood in order to accurately describe the system's optical and electronic properties.The electron-hole wave function consists of two separate mathematical components which are the explicitly correlated part of the wave function and the reference wave function which is operated on by the explicitly correlated operator. This dissertation presents theoretical development of both of these components. In the first part, a systematic formulation for deriving the explicitly correlated form of the electron-hole wave function was performed. Towards that goal, the electron-hole correlation length was defined using the electron-hole cumulant. The construction of explicitly correlated wave function was improved by the introduction of the electron-hole correlation length which was determined using the electron-hole cumulant. The electron-hole correlation length allowed the determination of parameters in the explicitly correlated operator without the performance of energy minimizations. In the second part, the electron-hole reference wave function was improved by combining full configuration electron-hole wave function with the explicitly correlated operator.The developed methods were used to investigate the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) and the effect of pH on the optical properties of quantum dots. The effect of applied electric fields on nanoparticles is known as the quantum-con?ned Stark effect. In this dissertation, the effect of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous electric fields on the optical and electronic properties of quantum dots was investigated. The effect of electric fields on the optical and electronic properties of a GaAs quantum dot was determined by combining the variational polaron transformation with the explicitly correlated electron-hole wave function. The presence of charged ligands also influenced the optical properties of quantum dot and this effect is known as the ligand-induced quantum-confined Stark effect. In this dissertation, the effect of pH on the optical properties of functionalized quantum dots were investigated by first calculating the charged states of the surface ligands at a given pH and then performing electron-hole explicitly correlated wave function based calculations in the electrostatic field generated by the charged ligands.Theoretical methods developed in this dissertation have impacted the field of computational nanoscience by reducing the computational bottleneck to investigate nanoparticles and by providing novel avenues for improving accuracy of existing methods."
etd_42,Thermal and photochemical reactions of large metallaborane clusters and functionalizations of boron nitride nanosheets,Chemistry,"Boron nitride nanosheets, Carborane, Crystal structures, Functional derivatives, Metallaborane, Photochemistry","The thermal and photochemical pathways of several metallaborane compounds and the functionalization of boron nitride nanosheets have been investigated. The nanosheets have potential applications in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells.Chapters 1 and 3 describe the thermal and photochemical pathways for two metalladecaboranes, [nido -6-Mn(CO) 3 B 9 H 13 ][NMe 4 ] (1.1) and [6-C5Me5-nido-6-RhB9H13] (3.1). Isomerization or cage closure reactions were observed depending on the reaction conditions and the transition metal employed. Characterized products include the firstnido-5 metalladecaborane and ahypercloso-metalladecaborane containing a group 7 transitional metal, compound1.3 and1.4, respectively. Other findings include the facile acid catalyzed cyclic oxonium functionalization of complex1.1, the role of complex3.1 as the catalyst for the [2+2+2] cycloadditions of terminal alkynes, and the formation ofhypercloso-rhodadecaborane3.3 which is the firsthypercloso-metalladecaborane containing the metal rhodium.Chapter 2 describes investigations of the photochemical reactions between metallaboranes and unsaturated molecules. The complex 1.1was found to photoreact with both terminal and internal alkynes to afford the carborane with general formula [7-R-8-R'-7,8-nido-C2B9H10][NMe4] (2) in good yield. This represents a novel method for generating the substituted nido-C2B9 complex. Besides alkynes, the investigation of the photoreactions of other unsaturated species with the complex 1.1 were found to generate the [arachno-B9H14]- (2.4) and [nido-B9H12]- (2.5) anions in different relative ratios, depending on the nature of the unsaturated molecules. The complex1.1 was also found to act as an efficient catalyst for isocyanate cyclodimerization under photo-irradiation conditions, representing the first example of a metallaborane complex to catalyse the cyclodimerization of isocyanate.In Chapter 4, an effective and simple noncovalent functionalization and solubilization of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) has been achieved by using polythiophene or polyvinylpyrrolidone as a functionalization polymer with BNNSs. The BNNSs form strong ?-? stacking interactions with the polythiophenes and were found to act as a bandgap tuning tool for polythiophene derivatives. A BNNS-polythiophne-TiO2 hybrid nanomaterial was achieved by the covalent binding between TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces and the BNNS-polythiophene unit containing a carboxylic acid functional group. This nanomaterial was then further incorporated into a Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) and the observed enhancement of the performance of the cells is discussed."
mae_etd_65,"Thermally Aware, Energy-Based Techniques for Improving Data Center Energy Efficiency",Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Data Center, Energy Efficiency, Virtualization","This work investigates the practical implementation of so-called thermally aware, energy optimized load placement in air-cooled, raised floor data centers to reduce the overall energy consumption, while maintaining the reliability of the IT equipment. The work takes a systematic approach to modeling the data center's airflow, thermodynamic and heat transfer characteristics - beginning with simplified, physics-inspired models and eventually developing a high-fidelity, experimentally validated thermo-hydraulic model of the data center's cooling and power infrastructure. The simplified analysis was able to highlight the importance of considering the trade-off between low air supply temperature and increased airflow rate, as well as the deleterious effect of temperature non-uniformity at the inlet of the racks on the data center's cooling infrastructure power consumption. The analysis enabled the development of a novel approach to reducing the energy consumption in enclosed aisle data centers using bypass recirculation. The development and experimental validation of a high-fidelity thermo-hydraulic model proceeded using the insights gained from the simple analysis. Using these tools, the study of optimum load placement is undertaken using computational fluid dynamics as the primary tool for analyzing the complex airflow and temperature patterns in the data center and is used to develop a rich dataset for the development of a reduced order model using proper orthogonal decomposition. The outcome of this work is the development of a robust set of rules that facilitate the energy efficient placement of the IT load amongst the operating servers in the data center and operation of the cooling infrastructure. The approach uses real-time temperature measurements at the inlet of the racks to remove IT load from the servers with the warmest inlet temperature (or add load to the servers with the coldest inlet temperature). These strategies are compared to conventional load placement techniques and show superior performance by considering the holistic optimization of the data center and cooling infrastructure for a range of data center IT utilization levels, operating strategies and ambient conditions."
bio_etd_87,Thermodynamic and Structural Characterization of the Interaction between Wd40 Repeat Containing Protein 5 (Wdr5) and Human Set1 Family Methyltransferases,Biology,"Crystallography, Epigenetics, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, Mixed Lineage Leukemia","Translocations and amplifications of the mixed lineage leukemia-1 (MLL1) gene are associated with aggressive myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias in humans. MLL1 is a member of the SET1 family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases, which are required for transcription of genes involved in hematopoiesis and development. MLL1 associates with a sub-complex containing WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD), which together form the MLL1 core complex that is required for sequential mono- and dimethylation of H3K4. We previously demonstrated that WDR5 binds the conserved WDR5 interaction (Win) motif of MLL1 in vitro, an interaction that is required for the H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex. In this dissertation, we demonstrate that arginine 3765 of the MLL1 Win motif is required to co-immunoprecipitate WRAD from mammalian cells, suggesting that the WDR5-Win motif interaction is important for the assembly of the MLL1 core complex in vivo. We also demonstrate that peptides that mimic human SET1 family Win motif sequences (MLL1-4, SETd1a and SETd1b) inhibit H3K4 dimethylation by the MLL1 core complex with varying degrees of efficiency. We show that the MLL3 Win motif peptide is the best inhibitor of the H3K4 dimethylation activity of MLL1 core complex. To understand the structural basis for these differences, we determined three-dimensional structures of WDR5 bound to six different naturally occurring Win motif sequences (MLL1-4, SETd1a and SETd1b). The structural analysis reveal that binding energy differences result from interactions between non-conserved residues C-terminal to the Win motif and to a lesser extent from subtle variation of residues within the Win motif. Based on the structure-function analysis, we deduce structural rules to facilitate the design of two additional Win motif -based inhibitors (Ac-10-mer and six-residue Win motif peptides) that bind WDR5 with <10 nM affinities. To understand the structural basis for this low nanomolar affinity, we determined X-ray three-dimensional structures of the Ac-10-mer Win motif peptide bound to WDR5. The structures suggest that the presence of additional intramolecular hydrogen bonds might contribute to the increased affinities for WDR5 possibly through the stabilization of the bound 310-helical conformation. We extend this structure-function analysis further to identify other peptidomimetics by characterizing peptides identified in a randomized phage display screen, which are also highly specific inhibitors of MLL1 core complex. Crystal structures of these peptidomimetics reveal novel protein structural features that contribute to increased affinity. We also present preliminary evidence suggesting that the MLL3 Win motif based peptide that has a cell penetrating sequence is readily taken up by mammalian cells. This MLL3 Win motif-based peptide (MLL3-FITC-TAT) is localized to euchromatin regions of cell nuclei, induces nuclear defects and inhibits global levels of H3K4 trimethylation. These results highlight a new class of methylation inhibitors that may be useful for the treatment of MLL1-related malignancies."
etd_70,THERMOTECTONIC EVOLUTION OF THE ALASKA RANGE: LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGIC CONSTRAINTS,Earth Sciences,"Alaska Range, Apatite fission-track, Apatite (U-Th)/He, Nenana Gravel, Plate tectonics, Thermochronology","The research presented here seeks to constrain the multiple episodes of uplift and denudation contributing to the formation of the Alaska Range. The approach will be to determine the thermal history (~30 Ma to the present) of the central, and eastern Alaska Range both temporally and spatially. Mechanisms of deformation (resulting in periodic episodes of rock uplift) along an intracontinental strike-slip margin may be constrained by investigating and understanding patterns of exhumation through time throughout the central and eastern Alaska Range.The southern Alaska continental margin is a complex boundary defined by active subduction and accretion of numerous terranes including the Yakutat microplate, the formation of a distinct volcanic arc system, and the development of major intracontinental strike-slip fault systems. The Alaska Range is located ~500 km inland of the active plate margin, along a major continental strike-slip fault system, the Denali Fault system (DFS). The high topography of the central Alaska Range, south of the DFS, occurs where its McKinley strand changes from a mainly east-west orientation to a southwest-northeast orientation. The high topography of the eastern Alaska Range lies to the northwest of the junction between the Hines Creek strand of the DFS and the main DFS strand to the south. I propose two approaches to resolve the thermotectonic history of the mountain range: 1) Direct sampling and quantification of the thermal evolution of the range itself including the central and eastern segments through low-temperature thermochronologic study of basement rocks; and 2) thermochronologic study of sediments of the Nenana Gravel and Usibelli Group in adjacent basins where deposition is related to the erosional unroofing of the Alaska Range.CHAPTER ONEThe goal is to constrain the lower temperature, and hence more recent cooling history of the region, and to determine whether there was variation (episodicity) in the exhumation rate since the Late Miocene, as well as to examine the exhumation record across the DFS.  The chapter revisits the same sampling set used in the original Fitzgerald et al., (1995), study applying (U-Th)/He apatite (AHe) thermochronology and HeFTy thermal modeling to evaluate the newer techniques against the old. AHe thermochronology was applied to samples in the broader McKinley area to better constrain regional exhumation patterns in relation to the master strand of the Denali Fault and to look for a predicted increase in regional exhumation rates associated with a trend in Late Cenozoic cooling. The general results of the AHe dating and the thermal modeling support the initiation of rapid cooling at ~6 Ma conclusion of the original AFT study.Another goal of this chapter is to better constrain the timing of onset and rate of exhumation of the northern foothills (i.e., terrain north of the DFS), as well as the central Alaska Range. There is also evidence of an earlier, but less significant, period of cooling at ~10 Ma. Denali Fault proximal cooling age trends suggest northward propagation of deformation that may be accommodated along previously unmapped thrust faults. Contrary to previous thermochronology work in Alaska, there is no evidence of an increase in exhumation rates after the introduction of glaciers to the region (~3 Ma) in the current thermochronology data set. The over-all new data supports the earlier conclusion of initiation of rapid exhumation related to a change in oblique convergence of the Southern Alaska Block. HeFTy modeling combined with the vertical transect approach provided additional constraints on the regions thermal history.CHAPTER TWOThe southern Alaskan continental margin has been tectonically active since at least the Cretaceous (~65 Ma), including ridge subduction (~65-50 Ma), Yakutat microplate translation (beginning ~30-25 Ma), Yakutat collision (~10 Ma-present) with a decrease in subduction angle to flat slab (~beginning at 10 Ma), microplate rotation (Southern Alaska Block) and Pacific plate motion changes relative to the North American plate at ~25-20, 12-10 and 5-6 Ma. Tectonic events along this southern margin resulted in intracontinental deformation and the development of the Alaska Range along the curved right-lateral strike-slip Denali fault system (DFS).In addition to higher-temperature thermochronologic methods applied to constrain the earlier thermal history of the eastern Alaska Range (EAR), low-temperature thermochronology on basement rocks of the EAR is being applied to constrain the more recent thermal history and formation of the modern day range.  Apatite fission-track (AFT) ages from north and south of the DFS located at, and around Nenana Mountain range from ~43-0.9 Ma. A distinct break in slope (the base of an exhumed partial annealing zone) in the Nenana Mountain vertical profile at ~6 Ma indicates the onset of rapid cooling, with an average cooling rate of ~20-30°C/m.y., and exhumation rate >1 km/m.y since that time.Apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) ages from multi-grain aliquots range from ~40-1 Ma for samples north and south of the DFS. In general, all but three AHe ages are consistent with rapid cooling due to exhumation from ~6-1 Ma. The EAR low-temperature thermochronology data has similarities with that from the western and central Alaska Ranges, namely the onset of an episode of rapid cooling at ~6 Ma; interpreted as rapid exhumation and uplift to form the modern day Alaska Range. We have yet to differentiate changes in cooling rates for AHe and/or AFT ages <6 Ma and hence better constrain the younger exhumation history of the range.Within the chapter I relate the near synchronicity between the onset of rapid cooling and exhumation in the central and eastern Alaska Range (~6 Ma) along the Denali fault, with plate motion change between the Pacific and North American plates. Plate motion change and an increase in relative convergence at ~6 Ma led to a greater-normal component of collision of the Yakutat microplate at the same time, as its more buoyant southern half of continental affinity entered the southern Alaskan subduction zone. This relationship either initiated or enhanced counterclockwise rotation of the Southern Alaska block (lying north of the plate boundary and south of the DFS) changing the partition of strain along the DFS, as well as causing thrusting along faults that splay off the DFS (e.g., Susitna Glacier thrust fault). All of these tectonic components contribute to the transference of stress from the active subduction zone to the DFS, along which the Alaska Range was formed, and where uplift, exhumation and deformation continues today.CHAPTER THREEThe aim of this chapter is to constrain multiple periods and patterns of denudation along an intra-continental strike-slip fault system that may then be related to specific tectonic periods of compression accommodated by the northward propagation of basin growth and development (Ruiz et al., 2004; Reiners and Brandon, 2006; Ridgway et al., 2007). The location and subsidence of interior basins located from northwestern Canada to eastern Alaska have been inferred to be controlled by the geometry of the neighboring major convex faults and the state of stress along these faults (i.e. Denali, Tintina and Border Ranges fault systems (Shultz and Aydin, 1990). By evaluating the distribution of locally reduced mean stresses through the use of a boundary element model, the development and subsidence of Tertiary interior basins can be explained by a combination of forces.The two main controlling factors on these basins include the geometry along major convex-shaped right-lateral faults and the state of stress and the change in that stress though time along these faults during the Tertiary based on plate motion vectors. Of note is the conclusion that rotation due to oroclinal bending did not prove a sufficient mechanism by itself to induce right-lateral slip and therefore result in enough mean stress to induce basin subsidence according to the model.  Trop, et al. (2007), examined the development of the Wrangell volcanic field (WVF) intra-arc basin during the Miocene. Based on analysis of the Frederika Formation (FF) and FF/WVF lavas, it was concluded that WVF intra-arc basin development overlapped with the cessation of strike-slip basin development and magmatism in the eastern WVF (~10 Ma) and is consistent with a diachronous collision of the Yakutat terrane against the northern Pacific margin. As a result of the uplift of the Alaska Range, sediment shed off the system was deposited to the north of the range within the Neogene Tanana and Cantwell basins.Defined periods of compression and northward propagation of thrust-top basin development can be related to tectonic driving mechanisms operating along the margin (Ridgway et al., 2007). These periods of unroofing should be defined by the decomposition of apatite fission-track cooling ages of samples collected throughout the Tanana basin stratigraphy. The goal of this chapter is to interpret links between depositional and deformational processes (i.e. exhumation cyclicity and/or episodic events) as related to the tectonic evolution of the collisional southern Alaska convergent margin. Deciphering the evolution of mountain belts and plate movements can be accomplished by combining basin analysis with exhumation research."

While common methodologies prepare simple ether and thioether substrates, the harsh conditions of these techniques make them unsuitable for complex molecules. The requirement for these functional groups to be prepared by facile and efficient means has led to an investigation into O - and S – alkylations occurring solely under thermal conditions utilizing trichloroacetimidates.The alkylation of thiols by the direct displacement of trichloroacetimidates has been accomplished under thermal conditions (heating in refluxing THF). These reactions proceed to the corresponding thioetherification product without the requirement of an added acid, base, or metal catalyst. This facile procedure provides the sulfide in excellent yields with only the formation of the neutral trichloroacetamide as the side product. Formation of the trichloroacetimidate in situ has also been studied, which provides a convenient method for the formation of sulfides from alcohols in a single flask.A similar methodology towards obtaining etherification products has also been investigated. O – Diphenylmethyl and para-methoxybenzyl trichloroacetimidates in refluxing solvent has shown to effectively convert a variety of alcohols to their corresponding ether without disturbing pre-existing functionality. This methodology provides the subsequent etherification products in moderate to excellent yields with only the formation of the neutral trichloroacetamide as the side product.Additionally, the development of a more efficient and concise total synthesis towards the SHIP1 activator AQX-1125 from trans-dehydroandrosterone has been studied. The synthetic approach features an allylic oxidation of the C7 position and ozonolysis to generate key intermediates. Alternative routes have also been proposed and future investigations will aim to complete this project in the future."
etd_707,Thomas Aquinas on the Metaphysical Nature of the Soul and its Union with the Body,Philosophy,"Aquinas, Hylomorphism, Soul, Substantial Unity","In this dissertation I examine Thomas Aquinas’ account of the metaphysical nature of the rational soul and its hylomorphic union with the body. Aquinas simultaneously holds that the rational soul is the substantial form of the human being and that it is an incorporeal subsisting thing that survives death. This particular pairing of views is notoriously difficult. On the one hand, Aquinas argues that because of the soul’s role as substantial form, it informs prime matter so as to compose a single unified substance—the human being. Unlike aggregates or accidental unities, the human being is something unqualifiedly one, that is, something unum simpliciter. On the other, his commitment to the incorporeity and subsistence of the soul as well as its continued exitence after death appear to threaten this unity—if the soul’s existence does not depend on the body, and it can exist on its own, then it seems to be a complete substance in its own right. If so, on Aquinas’ view, it cannot be united to anything else to form something unum simpliciter. So, in spite of Aquinas’ insistence that the human being is unqualifiedly one it is not clear that he is philosophically entitled to it.In the first half of my dissertation I determine the extent to which the incorporeity, subsistence, and incorruptibility of the soul threaten to undermine Aquinas’ account of human unity. I argue that when his account of the soul and its relationship to the body is properly understood within his metaphysical framework, the metaphysical nature of the soul is compatible with human unqualified unity. Moreover, I argue that although human beings are metaphysically unique among created substances in his ontology, Aquinas adequately motivates their peculiar hybrid status.In the second half of my dissertation, I discuss two of Aquinas’ arguments for the hylomorphic union of body and soul. Both arguments are found in Summa Theologiae I.76.1. The first is based on Aristotle’s demonstration in De Anima II.2 that the soul is the form of the body. I argue that while Aquinas’ version of the argument is similar to Aristotle’s in many ways, it goes beyond Aristotle’s in ways that reflect his specific motivations, and in particular, his disagreement with Averroes concerning the relationship between intellective soul and body.The second argument for hylomorphism in Summa Theologiae I.76.1 involves Aquinas’ rejection of three competing accounts of the relationship between intellect and body, namely, the Platonist, Averroist, and Moved-Mover accounts. While Aquinas’ argument may initially appear to be a mere argument by elimination, I argue that a common theme emerges in his rejection of the alternatives. According to Aquinas, none of his competitors can satisfactorily account for the rationality, animality, and unity of the human being. At best, each competitor can account for two out of the three. In his view, therefore, Aquinas’ rejection of competing accounts provides positive reasons for affirming the hylomorphic account of body and soul, namely, that only his view can succeed where the others fail."
etd_69,"THOREAU'S A WEEK, RELIGION AS PRESERVATIVE CARE: OPPOSING THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF DISCOVERY, MANIFEST DESTINY, AND A RELIGION OF SUBJUGATION",Religion,"Conflict Transformation, Doctrine of Discovery, Henry David Thoreau, Manifest Destiny, Native American, Transcendentalism","This dissertation argues for a rereading of Henry David Thoreau's A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849) as ""Transcendental scripture writing."" By placing his book in this genre, Thoreau's religious thinking comes to the fore. His book becomes a contextualized pilgrimage addressing three levels of human existence in the religious realm: (1) where we have been and are now, (2) where we could be, and (3) how to reach that next, better self with more intimate, liberative relationships with others. As he addresses human limitations and his hope for better human and nonhuman relationships, Thoreau articulates a religion of ""preservative care"" that seeks to address past wrongs while nurturing sustained peace, which makes his outlook significant for the present.This vision of life filled with sustained peace, however, does not circumvent a serious reexamination of the violence that went into America's founding. As he addresses the history of the United States, Thoreau emphasizes a dominant oppressive trend in America as Native Americans and the environment are continuously devalued and pushed to the margins. Thoreau associates this oppressive trajectory with a Western politico-theological justification for the domination, conversion, and attempted extermination of non-Christian, Indigenous peoples--a repressive posture that scholars currently define as the ""Christian Doctrine of Discovery."" Thoreau makes it clear that belief in Christian supremacy and the desire to construct a decidedly Christian nation have led to the attempted mastery over Indigenous populations, their land, and the natural world, which has concomitantly led to diminished lives for those perpetuating this ""religion of subjugation.""He counters this with an ideal of non-institutionalized religion grounded in the natural world and informed by Native American values and ways of being. In the end, Thoreau's ""wild"" religion seeks to preserve The Law of Regeneration or the dynamic laws of nature in all existence--human and nonhuman alike. This is Thoreau's religion of preservative care, and it has important implications for current religious dialogues addressing Indigenous rights and the repudiation of the Christian Doctrine of Discovery--especially within the liberal religious Unitarian Universalist denomination as Thoreau is considered part of its religious heritage. A Week prods the tradition to be more ecologically attuned in religious matters, to be less anthropocentrically oriented, and to be united with the downtrodden through a religious presupposition affirming solidarity with all oppressed beings--human and nonhuman alike. This orientation re-envisions religion as a healthy, transformative presence in the world as it aims to cultivate sustained peace, which is needed in today's world negatively affected by violence and injustice too often grounded in religious discourses and buttressed by pernicious religious sentiments."

Chapters 1 and 2 examine the electricity industry in the United States and the motivation behind electric utilities' usage of demand side management programs. The first chapter focuses on load management programs, which decrease electricity demand during the peak hours of the day. It looks into the impact of a plausibly exogenous decrease in natural gas prices on the utilization and capacity of these programs. The second chapter analyzes the relationship between electricity market deregulation and electric utilities' energy efficiency activity. The third chapter investigates the impact of Chinese enterprise restructuring on employment, wage bills, and productivity.

Chapter 1 examines the employment and wage effects of the refugee influx from Syria on Turkish native labor. Results indicate statistically significant negative employment and wage effects on the low-skilled and less-experienced individuals especially in the border regions. The second chapter investigates the impact of the presence of foreign missions on trade. This study uses Turkey’s aggressive expansion in its foreign mission network as the source of variation and finds significant positive effect on both the exports and imports.  The final chapter, coauthored with Devashish Mitra, analyzes the impact of the imports from China on employment shares and wages across the various Turkish manufacturing industries for the period 2004-2015. The results imply a relative positive impact on employment share in skilled labor intensive sectors and more precise larger negative impact on wages in all sectors."
etd_196,Three Essays in Applied Econometrics: with Application to Natural Resource and Energy Markets,Economics,"Econometrics, Energy Economics, Extreme Value Theory, Nonparametric Estimation, Spatial Econometrics","Chapter 1This essay examines the effect of state renewable energy policies in inducing innovation and the spillover effect of these policies on innovation in neighboring states. The analysis is conducted with patent data related to renewable technology using wind power for the United States over the period 1983-2010. We run a panel data regression of a log transformation of states' yearly patent counts on state renewable energy policies and spatially weighted average of renewable energy policies in neighboring states using the Tobit model with individual effects. The results show that renewable energy rules, regulation and mandates such as interconnection standards, net metering and renewable portfolio standard enacted in neighboring states have shown a statistically significant positive spillover effect in increasing the number of patent applications in that state. However, financial policies such as tax incentives and subsidy policies implemented by neighboring states have shown statistically significant negative effects on technological innovation within that state.Chapter 2In this essay, we have conducted a Monte Carlo Study of the prediction performance of various nonparametric estimation methods for spatially dependent data, such as the nonparametric local linear kernel estimator, the Nadraya-Watson estimator, and the k-Nearest Neighbors method developed by Hallin et al. (2004b), Lu and Chen (2002), P.M. Robinson (2011) and Li and Tran (2009). With data sampled on a rectangular grid in a nonlinear random field, the results show that nonparametric local linear kernel method has the best performance in terms of mean squared prediction error. The Nadaraya-Watson estimation method also performs well. In general, these two nonparametric methods consistently outperform the k-Nearest Neighbors method and the maximum likelihood method regardless of the data generating process and sample size. However, the maximum likelihood method does not perform well because the spatial weight matrix can only be used to estimate linear structures while the true data generating process is nonlinear. This also gives some support to the idea of using nonparametric methods when various misspecification may exist either in the functional form or spatial weight matrix for spatially dependent data.We use these methods to predict county-level crop yields with spatially weighted precipitation. The results are generally consistent with the simulation results. The nonparametric local linear kernel estimator has the best prediction performance. The Nadaraya-Watson estimator also performs better than the k-Nearest Neighbors method and the maximum likelihood estimator. However, with an inverse distance weighting matrix, the maximum likelihood estimator outperforms the k-Nearest Neighbors method in predicting crop yield.Chapter 3This essay uses the ""exceedances over high threshold model"" of Davidson and Smith (1990)  to investigate the univariate tail distribution of the returns on various energy products such as Crude Oil, Gasoline, Heating Oil, Propane and Diesel. The bivariate threshold exceedance model of Ledford and Tawn (1996) is also used to study the tail dependence between returns on various pairs of selected energy products. Tail index estimates for univariate threshold exceedance models show that these returns generally have fat tails similar to those of a Student's t-Distribution with 2 to 5 degrees of freedom except that for Crude Oil where the tail index estimates  are closer to that of a normal distribution. We also estimate the tail dependence index for four pairs of energy products, crude oil/gasoline, crude oil/heating oil, crude oil/propane, crude oil/diese. The correlation coefficients implied by the dependence index estimates show that correlations conditional on threshold exceedance are generally higher than the unconditional correlation between crude oil/heating oil and crude oil/gasoline. However, there is some variation in the implied correlation between crude oil/propane and crude oil/diesel. Whether the extreme correlation will be higher or lower than the unconditional correlation depends on the threshold chosen."
etd_691,Three Essays in Urban Policy,Public Administration,"Audit Study, Discrimination Experiment, Fair Housing Awareness, Housing Discrimination, Housing Policy, Rental Housing","The papers in this dissertation share a common theme of measuring policy effects in urban markets. Though focusing on different outcomes – access to rental housing, property values, and school enrollments – the desire to understand how policy influences the composition of an urban ecosystem provides the link. A particular emphasis is placed on housing, because housing is simultaneously and a basic requirement for humans to thrive and the primary source of most local finance in the U.S. When policy affects housing, be it directly or indirectly, it can have important and far-reaching consequences. Understanding the intended and unintended consequences of urban policy is thus central to this dissertation research and my future research agenda.Chapter 1 offers the first evidence of differential treatment occurring across the broad spectrum of racial and protected classes covered under the law. Employing a fully randomized correspondence audit design and a sample of more than 9,500 online housing advertisements, the study offers insight about which protected groups experience the most/least favorable treatment when searching for housing. This study employs a new signaling strategy in order to provide the first evidence of how landlord treatment of rental housing applicants varies across the spectrum of protected classes. The findings suggest rental-housing providers have preferences about tenants and make decisions based on signals communicated in inquiry emails from potential applicants. The findings also suggest differential treatment is generally consistent with theory of agent-based statistical discrimination.Chapter 2 presents an experiment designed to influence rental agent behavior to increase equal treatment in rental housing. The purpose is to test whether property owners and rental agents will change their behavior in response to being informed about their obligations under fair housing law. The project thus conducts a randomized experiment employs a correspondence housing audit methodology to measure the impact, representing the first time in which the audit methodology is employed to measure the effect of a randomized experiment. The results of the experiment consistently suggest the group of landlords who received information about fair housing law responded at a higher rate than did those who did not receive the treatment email. The primary contribution of this paper, then, is to demonstrate a unique opportunity to test policy interventions aimed at reducing discrimination in a real housing market and at a very low cost. My hope is that the method will be modified and expanded by fair housing agencies, advocates, and other institutions to test and implement policy interventions in hopes of reducing barriers to access in housing.Chapter 3 examines the impact of a place-based program on urban property values and school enrolments. A recent trend in place-based policy targets college attainment by offering tuition scholarships for qualified students in under-resourced public schools. In an era of rising college costs, these programs represent a potentially large financial benefit to those living within the attendance zones of qualifying schools. The benefit of such programs should be capitalized into local property values and school district enrolment, as programs are directly linked to attendance zones. This research thus examines the impact a large scholarship program, Say Yes to Education, has on school enrolments and property values in upstate New York. Examining district enrollment from 2000 through 2014, the analysis finds that after years of steady declines in enrollments, both Syracuse and Buffalo saw enrollment increases that coincide with the adoption of the Say Yes to Education program. These increases occurred at different points in time in each city. The housing values results provide some evidence that increases in housing prices accompanied the adoption of Say Yes in Syracuse, but not in Buffalo. These results are consistent with findings that enrolment growth in Buffalo may have been driven by students who would otherwise have attended private schools, while enrollment growth in Syracuse may have been driven by students who would otherwise have attended school in the surrounding suburbs. Combined with the enrolment effects, the analysis suggests that the ability of place-based scholarships to attract residents into a central city is likely to depend on both the specific provisions of the program and the context in which it is implemented."
etd_231,Three Essays on Individual and Collective Choice Theory from a Revealed Preference Approach,Economics,,"This dissertation consists of three chapters.The first chapter develops an individual choice model to incorporate the extremeness aversion phenomenon, which refers to people's tendency to avoid extreme options. I follow a revealed preference approach and instead of involving any exogenous structures (e.g. attributes) to describe options or identify extreme ones, I deduce both preferences and extremeness endogenously from observed choices. My first result employs extremeness aversion to explain choice situations with revealed context effects and is also applicable to choice situations where the standard revealed preference theory applies. Without referring to further structures, I provide a choice-theoretical justification for extremeness. The second result sharpens this characterization by imposing a more concrete structure, a linear order, to identify extreme options. In particular, I strengthen the previous choice-theoretical justification and derive a linear order defined on the universal set of options; we describe an individual as if she consistently exhibits extremeness aversion with respect to the linear order. A concrete situation addressed by the second result is the experimental design applied to test the extremeness aversion phenomenon: options are portrayed by two attributes. To formally incorporate extremeness aversion with options represented by two attributes, I propose a two-stage process. My third result characterizes the two-stage process by obtaining the attributes endogenously. Accordingly, I interpret it as extremeness aversion with revealed attributes.Part of the study of the two-dimensional result of the first chapter is related to a more general problem. Although the first chapter embedded the question into the context of individual decision-making, the same question can be also rephrased in terms of collective decision-making, which is formally presented and fully answered in my second chapter. Intuitively, suppose that we can observe the relation aggregated from preferences of a group of two agents but we are ignorant about the individual agents' preferences. Under what kind of conditions the aggregated relation is consistent with the Pareto dominance relation? The Pareto dominance relation of a preference profile is (the asymmetric part of) a partial order. In the second chapter, I use two independent conditions to characterize when (the asymmetric part of) a partial order defined on a finite set of options can be represented as the Pareto dominance relation of a two-agent preference profile.More generally, for any integer n, the problem of the existence of an n-agent preference profile that generates the given Pareto dominance relation is to investigate the dimension of the partial order. In the third chapter, I provide a general characterization for an n-dimensional partial order."
it_etd_84,Three Essays on Law Enforcement and Emergency Response Information Sharing and Collaboration: An Insider Perspective,Information Science and Technology,"Collaboration, Communication, Cooperation, Information Sharing, Stigmergy, Trust","This dissertation identifies what may be done to overcome barriers to information sharing among federal, tribal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and emergency responders. Social, technical, and policy factors related to information sharing and collaboration in the law enforcement and emergency response communities are examined. This research improves information sharing and cooperation in this area. ""Policing in most societies exists in a state of ""dynamic tension"" between forces that tend to isolate it and those that tend to integrate its functioning with other social structures"" (Clark, 1965). Critical incidents and crimes today cross jurisdictions and involve multiple stakeholders and levels. Law enforcement and emergency response agencies at federal, tribal, state, and local levels, including private sector entities, gather information and resources but do not effectively share this with each other. Despite mandates to improve information sharing and cooperation, gaps remain perhaps because there is no clear understanding of what the barriers to information sharing are. Information sharing is examined using a multi-method, primarily qualitative, approach. A model for information sharing is presented that identifies social, technical, and policy factors as influencers. Facets of General Systems Theory, Socio-technical Theory, and Stakeholder Theory (among others) are considered in this context. Information sharing is the subject of the first work of the dissertation: a theoretical piece arguing for use of a conceptual framework consisting of social, technical, and policy factors. Social, technology, and policy factors are investigated in the second essay. That essay introduces a new transformative technology, ""edgeware,"" that allows for unprecedented connectivity among devices. Social and policy implications for crisis response are examined in light of having technological barriers to sharing resources reduced. Human and other factors relevant to information sharing and collaboration are further examined through a case study of the Central New York Interoperable Communications Consortium (CNYICC) Network, a five-county collaboration involving law enforcement, public safety, government, and non-government participants. The three included essays have a common focus vis-à-vis information sharing and collaboration in law enforcement and emergency response. The propositions here include: (P1) Information sharing is affected by social, technical, and policy factors, and this conceptualization frames the problem of information sharing in a way that it can be commonly understood by government and non-government stakeholders. The next proposition involves the role of technology, policy, and social systems in information sharing: (P2) Social and policy factors influence information sharing more than technical factors (assuming it is physically possible to connect and/or share). A third proposition investigated is: (P3) Social factors play the greatest role in the creation and sustaining of information sharing relationships. The findings provide a greater understanding of the forces that impact public safety agencies as they consider information sharing and will, it is hoped, lead to identifiable solutions to the problem from a new perspective."
etd_570,Three Essays on Peer Effects and Juvenile Delinquency,Economics,,"This dissertation comprises three essays on peer effects and juvenile delinquency. The first paper explores the existence of differential peer effects on youth crime for adolescents with different parental engagement. A cultural transmission model is developed and taken to the data, showing that peer effects on juvenile crime are significantly lower for teenagers with engaged mothers. The second paper presents a new theory of crime where leaders transmit crime technology and act as a role model for other criminals. Using a definition of the leader which is exogenous to the network formation, we find that the longer is the distance to the leader, the lower is the criminal activity of the students and the less likely they become criminals. The last paper exploits the exogenous variation in peer groups generated by high school to college transitions to study the predictions of a theoretical model of self-control in peer groups. We find that students embedded in social circles have more self-control, whereas students’ self-control is a non-monotonic hump-shaped function of the average self-control of their friends. A representative sample of high-school students in the United States is used in all papers."
etd_221,Three Essays on Public Economics and Policy,Economics,,"This dissertation studies the effects of public programs that target at disadvantaged population. In particular, I examine the effects of these programs on individual well-being and whether these programs lead to behavior distortions. The dissertation consists of three essays that focus on different policy contexts and different populations.In the first essay, I examine the effects of an active labor market program on the labor market outcomes of veterans. In the 1990s, the US Department of Defense implemented the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to help military personnel transition to the civilian labor market. The program provides career counseling, employment workshops, and information briefing on educational and medical benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The goal of this study is to measure the long-run effects of TAP on the labor market outcomes of veterans. To identify these effects, I exploit variation in program accessibility generated by its initial rollout process. Using data from the veterans supplement to the Current Population Survey, survey years 2001, 2003 and 2005, I find that TAP improves the labor market outcomes of veterans, measured approximately ten years after their separation from the military. The effects of TAP on labor market outcomes vary across veterans with different lengths of military experience, and these effects attenuate over time. One possible mechanism is that TAP encourages use of the GI Bill, a program that provides tuition reimbursement and a monthly allowance to attend institutions of higher education. Moreover, the effect of TAP is concentrated among participants who, based on self-reports, find TAP most helpful in career related services.In the second essay, I examine linkages between Medicaid availability, insurance coverage for pregnant women, use of prenatal care and the health outcomes of newborns. Medicaid coverage for pregnant women would potentially improve health outcomes of newborns by providing medical services at no cost. At the same time, Medicaid provides an incentive for eligible individuals to drop private insurance coverage. I exploit variation from two federal Medicaid expansions in mid-1980s, which eliminated the eligibility discontinuity across age groups. The main data come from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Vital Statistics Birth Records. I employ a difference-in-differences method. Findings suggest that the expansions led to a relative increase in Medicaid coverage for women from the immediately affected age group by a significant 6.5 percentage points. However, up to 60% of new beneficiaries would have been covered by private insurance, absent of the expansions. Findings do not reveal significant improvement in birth outcomes, or increase in prenatal care utilization.In the third essay, I examine the effect of Medicaid on the asset holding behavior of the elderly. Medicaid provides coverage for nursing home care to elderly with limited resources. The eligibility rule potentially creates an incentive for the elderly to reduce their asset by making transfers to children. This study provides empirical evidence for the effect of Medicaid nursing home care policy on elderly's asset allocation. I exploit a policy change in 2006, the Deficit Reduction Act 2005, which imposed stricter penalty to asset transfer behavior when determining Medicaid eligibility. Using data from the Health and Retirement Survey, I employ a difference-in-differences method. I find that the elderly who anticipated nursing home entry significantly reduced asset transfer behavior by 3.2 to 4 percentage points, in response to the policy change. The result is robust across demographic groups and more pronounced for the elderly with the highest nursing home entry risk. The findings provide evidence of moral hazard in the public insurance market: the elderly would game with the system in anticipation of nursing home needs."
etd_698,Three Essays on Public Procurement,Public Administration,"National Defense, Public Administration, Public Procurement","The following dissertation presents three essays on the theory and empirics of public procurement—the process by which government defines its needs for goods and services and acquires them using contracts. The objective of this dissertation is to address three unresolved questions in the literature regarding how the characteristics of products governments procure, and the environments in which they are bought and sold, shape government and non-governmental actors’ decision making at different points in the procurement process.The first essay develops an expanded theory of government’s decision to directly deliver public services—social welfare, energy utilities, select forms of security provision, and other services for citizens—or contract out these responsibilities to third parties. The essay takes as its point departure that transaction cost economics—the theory that a product is “made” or “bought” based on the ease or difficulty with which it can be defined, produced, and exchanged via a contract—does not adequately account for the environmental context within which governments select among alternative service delivery modes. The essay rectifies this deficiency by drawing on resource dependence theory, a complementary theory arguing that the make-or-buy decision turns on the nature of the public service marketplace: the number of alternative sellers with which a government can do business, and the amount of revenue sellers derive from this government vis-à-vis their other customers. The argument is that combined, these factors shape the degree of power government can exercise in a contracting relationship, directly influencing the choice to make or buy a service as well as moderating the impact of service-specific characteristics. This argument is specified in a set of hypotheses and a model for testing in future empirical research.The second essay examines how the characteristics of products government chooses to buy (rather than make) influence competition among sellers vying for its business. Drawing from transaction cost economics, the essay argues product complexity—defined and operationalized in terms of asset specificity, or the degree of relationship-specific physical and human capital investments required to produce and deliver a product—is a key determinant of competition. More specifically, the essay argues (i) at higher levels of complexity, and thus of asset specificity, sellers may deem the risks of doing business with the government as too high to warrant submitting a bid, but (ii) while lower levels of complexity may decrease these risks, they may also discourage competition by creating a collective action dilemma: for a simpler product, individual sellers may not submit a bid because they believe the competition will be too intense, and their probability of winning too low. This reasoning points to two effects—a project risk effect (simpler products invite more bids) and a win probability effect (simpler products invite less bids)—and implies competing hypotheses for how complexity influences competition. The essay presents an econometric test of these hypotheses using a sample of information technology procurements drawn from U.S. procurement federal data, finding that the effects mostly offset one another. The effects likely operate with greater force (in one direction or another) in larger, program-based procurements (e.g., of major weapons or information systems) that can span many years and involve multiple individual contracts for development, production, maintenance, and upgrades. Thus, a more complete theoretical story that links complexity and competition would likely need to make its propositions contingent on the depth and duration of the underlying business relationship, as well as the nature of the product being procured.The third essay examines the conditions under which government adopts and implements alternative strategies to procure products after it has selected and awarded its business to one from a competing set of sellers. Specifically, the essay examines the conditions under which government implements a knowledge-based procurement strategy predicated on incremental delivery of product capabilities and a sequential approach to product development and production (typically seen as a best practice), or a strategy predicated on delivering product capabilities in a single-step fashion and using a concurrent approach to development and production activities. The essay starts from the observation that procurements executed in accordance with knowledge-based principles consistently feature strong leadership—individuals purported to be pivotal in ensuring procurements adhere to a strategy anchored in knowledge—and posits that leader commitment influences adoption of the knowledge-based approach through a “credible commitment” mechanism. In essence, tenured leaders serve an advocacy role for the procurements they oversee, ensuring the procurements receive sufficient support and protecting them from policymakers wishing to commit resources to other projects (including those for which failure to follow a knowledge-based strategy could invite future problems, but, at least in the short-run, appear that they will take less time and provide more capability). In this way, sustained leadership provides teams tasked with managing procurements incentives to “stay the course,” maintaining adherence to a knowledge-based strategy, pursuing modest capability objectives, and taking the time necessary for sequential development and production. The essay samples and examines a set of four successfully executed United States weapon system procurements to probe the plausibility of the credible commitment mechanism, finding and presenting evidence that leaders do influence employment of knowledge-based strategies in part through this channel."
etd_749,"THREE ESSAYS ON RETURNS TO EDUCATION, HEALTH AND THE SPATIAL WAGE CURVE IN TURKEY",Economics,"compulsory schooling, health, returns to education, spatial wage curve, Turkey, wage curve",This dissertation comprises three papers on wage and health returns to education and spatial wage curve in Turkey. The second and third chapters make use of the exogenous variations generated by the 1997 Eight-Year Compulsory Schooling Law and the accompanying middle- school class openings to estimate economic and health returns to education. The findings suggest that the reform and the intensity of the reform substantially increased the educational attainment. The second chapter investigates the wage returns to education. Results show that one additional year of schooling increases individual wages by around 9 percent. The third chapter examines the causal impact of education on health outcomes and health behavior. The estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant effect of education on health outcomes. The final chapter focuses on the spatial wage curve in Turkey. Results show that individual real wages are more responsive to the adjacent regions’ unemployment rates than the local unemployment rates. Further investigation reveals that the wage curve estimates are sensitive to the use of group-specific regional unemployment rates.
etd_119,Three Essays on Robust Estimation of Key Factors Underlying the Changes to the U.S. Income Distribution,Economics,,"This dissertation consists of three chapters and mainly focuses on the robust estimation of different important factors contributing changes to the U.S. income inequality over the last two decades. The primary objective is to precisely estimate different labor market outcomes when the behaviors of the tails of the distribution bear much importance. These studies are very relevant in the current context of the U.S. labor market because over the last three decades the U.S. income distribution have come very skewed and therefore, we are more interested at the behaviors of the the upper and lower-tails of the U.S. income distribution compared to the middle.The first chapter of the dissertation proposes a semi-parametric procedure to determine the contribution of human capital variables in explaining the changes of U.S. wage distribution function over the period of 1990-2000. The effects of these factors are estimated by using the Chamberlain's two stage Box-Cox quantile regression approach. One of the main contributions of this chapter is that it relaxes the linearity assumption of the conditional quantile function to estimate the counterfactual wage distribution function consistently. This chapter also shows that the proposed method provides better estimates of capturing the effects of human capital variables in the two tails of the U.S. wage distribution while the results of other parts of the distribution are comparable with the estimates of the previous study which used the linear quantile regression approach.The second chapter proposes a semi-parametric estimation method known as `Box-Cox Unconditional Quantile Regression' to explain the increasing trend of the U.S. wage inequality over the last two decades for men and women separately. Box-Cox Unconditional Quantile Regression is a generalization of the Linear Unconditional Quantile Regression model proposed by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009). The main contribution of this chapter is to determine the role of unionization in explaining the rising wage gap between the upper and lower tails of the U.S. wage distribution function during the period 1990-2010. I also show that proposed Box-Cox unconditional Quantile Regression model precisely estimates the parameters compared to the Linear Unconditional Quantile Regression model at the two tails of the U.S. wage distribution function while the results of the rest of the part of the distribution are comparable with the estimates of the previous study by Firpo et al. (2009). To summarize, this proposed approach is most applicable in cases where the behavior of the tails of the distribution bears much importance. I find that declining unionization can explain around 20-25 percent of the total fall in the 50/10 percentile wage gap and does not have much impact on the rise in the 90/50 percentile wage gap for men over the period 1990-2010. For women, unionization has very little impact on the rising wage gaps at different parts of the wage distribution over the last two decades.In the third chapter I propose an extension of Rosen's (1986) theory of equalizing differences model by incorporating the role of different types of cognitive and noncognitive skills in worker's job preference function to explain the U.S. labor market sorting mechanism. I show that ignoring the impact of worker's skills on occupational choice decision leads to bias and inconsistent results because of sample selection specification error. This chapter proposes a solution of the problem by using workers' education level as the proxy of the cognitive skills. This chapter also tests the implication of the proposed labor market sorting model by using the current population survey and Occupational Information Network data sets and finds that a positive and statistically significant relationship exists between noncognitive skills and workers sorting behavior. The empirical results suggest that the relative employment share of women is higher in the occupation in which the people's task is more important because of their job preferences, which depend on the level of different types of noncognitive skills such as interpersonal and social skills. This type of sorting behavior can explain a large portion of the male-female wage gap."
etd_524,Three Essays on Testing for Cross-Sectional Dependence and Specification in Large Panel Data Models,Economics,"Cross-sectional Dependence, Large N Large T, Panel Data Models, Serial Correlation, Sphericity, Tests of Specification","This dissertation consists of three essays on testing for cross-sectional dependence and specification in large panel data models. The first two essays are based on the papers joint with Prof. Badi H. Baltagi and Prof. Chihwa Kao; the third essay is based on the working paper joint with Prof. Lee. The first essay considers testing for Sphericity with non-normality in a fixed effects panel data model. The second essay considers testing for cross-sectional dependence in heterogeneous large N and large T panel data models allowing error serial correlation. The third  essay considers the tests of specification in large N and large T dynamic panel data models.The first essay proposes a test for sphericity in a fixedeffects panel data regression model which is robust to non-normality of thedisturbances. It builds up on the work of Chen, Zhang and Zhong (2010) whouse $U$-statistics to test for sphericity of the variance-covariance matrixin statistics. Since the errors are unobservable, the residuals from thefixed effects regression are used. The limiting distribution of the proposedtest statistic is derived. Additionally, its finite sample properties areexamined using Monte Carlo simulations.The second essay considers the problem of testing cross-sectional dependence inlarge panel data models with serially correlated errors. It finds thatexisting tests for cross-sectional independence encounter size distortionswith serial correlation in the errors. To control the size, itproposes a modification of Pesaran's CD\ test to account for seriallycorrelation of an unknown form in the error term. We derive the limitingdistribution of this test as $\left(  N,T\right)  \rightarrow\infty$. The testis distribution free and allows for unknown forms of serial correlation in theerrors. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test has good size and power forlarge panels when serial correlation in the errors are present.The third essay considers the tests of specification,including the tests for serial correlation and the tests of overidentifyingrestrictions, for large dynamic panel data models.\ The test statistics arebuilt upon the two-step GMM estimations using three different instrumentmatrices: the block-diagonal matrix with a full set of all availableinstruments, the block-diagonal matrix with a subset of all availableinstruments and the collapsed matrix with a subset of all availableinstruments. It shows that the conventional Sargan's test of overidentifyingrestrictions (Arellano and Bond (1991)) does not approximate to the chi-squaredistribution, when the number of instruments used, is relatively as large as$N$; therefore it proposes corrected Sargan's tests with different instrumentmatrices. The limiting distributions of all the tests of specification arederived as $N$ and $T$ go to infinity simultaneously. Power properties arediscussed under varieties of alternatives, The results show that the tests forserial correlation are powerful against different alternatives, and the powerof corrected Sargan's tests only increases as $N$ increases. Monte Carlosimulations confirm our theoretical findings, especially showing that thecorrected Sargan's tests have the correct size. Besides, it suggests using thecollapsed instrument matrix for the practical testing purpose."
etd_463,Three essays on the effects of health insurance and taxation policies,Economics,"group health insurance, group health insurance costs, Health Savings Accounts, mental health parity, SCHIP, tax subsidies","This dissertation comprises three papers on the impacts of health insurance and taxation policies on individuals’ health care and labor market outcomes. The policy contexts include income tax subsidy reform, group health insurance regulation, and public health insurance expansion. In every chapter, I use state by year policy variation and individual level survey data to provide the effectiveness and efficiency cost analysis of these policies.My first chapter presents new empirical evidence on the impact of tax subsidies for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) on group insurance coverage. HSAs are tax-free health care expenditure savings accounts. Coupled with high deductible health insurance plans (HDHPs), they together represent new health insurance options. The tax advantage of HSAs expands the group health insurance market by making health care more affordable. Using individual level data from the Current Population Survey and exploiting policy variation by state and year from 2004 to 2012, I find that HSA tax subsidies increase small-group coverage by a statistically significant 2.5 percentage points, although not coverage in larger firms. Moreover, if the tax price of HSA contribution decreases by 10 cents, small-group insurance coverage increases by almost 2 percentage points. I also find that for older workers or less-educated workers, HSA subsidies are associated with 2-3 percentage point increase in their group insurance coverage.In the second chapter, I provide new empirical evidence on the impacts of state and federal mental health parity laws on related labor market outcomes, particularly working time. Implemented in the last two decades, these policies aim to eliminate differences in mental and physical health benefits among group health plans. The mandated benefits for mental health drive up the costs of providing health insurance substantially. In response, employers may avoidhiring more full-time workers, whose compensation includes health insurance, by increasing working time per worker and reliance on part-time employment, and employees have an incentive to increase their labor supply to qualify for the benefits. Using individual level data from the Current Population Survey and exploiting policy variation by state and year, I find state parity laws increase average weeks worked by 1.4%. Since self-insured firms are exempted from state regulations, parity is estimated to have nearly twice as large an effect on small firms as it does on large firms. Moreover, I study two federal parity laws and find the more expansive one is associated with 1.7% more weeks worked. Overall, there is no strong evidence that parity laws affect hours worked and prevalence of coverage significantly.The third chapter examines the effect of public health insurance expansions during 1997-2002 on the mental and behavioral health of children. Using three waves of the National Survey of America’s Families (NSAF) and legislative State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) income eligibility thresholds by state-year-age, we explore the causal impact of SCHIP generosity on participation, general health care utilization, mental health service utilization, and finally children’s mental and behavioral health measures. Our results first show that SCHIP thresholds significantly increased public health insurance coverage and general health care utilization. However, there is almost no statistically significant evidence of increases in mental health care utilization or improvements in general mental health outcomes for the whole sample, When we focus on the Assessing the New Federalism (ANF) “study states” that comprise the bulk of the NSAF sample, we find a bit more evidence that SCHIP expansions may have slightly increased the probability of receiving mental health care as well as a few specific mental health outcomes for some age groups, but overall estimated effects remain small."
etd_264,Three essays on the impact of student assignment policies,Social Sciences,"School Choice, Segregation, Student Assignment, Unitary","This dissertation is comprised of three essays, which study the impact of student assignment policies. The first two papers investigate the impacts of the removal of school desegregation plans on school racial segregation and on ninth grade repetition rates in the U.S. The third paper examines the impact of the school choice policy in Seoul, Korea on school segregation by academic performance levels.Over the last two decades, half of school districts that were subject to court desegregation orders in the U.S. were released from those court orders. In response, many school districts modified student assignment plans that had been adopted to integrate public schools. Chapter 1 documents the changes in school desegregation plans and examines the effect of the changes on racial school segregation in approximately 100 school districts. Analysis of student enrollment data from 1988 to 2012 suggests that recent changes in student assignment plans caused a moderate increase in school racial segregation. The results of additional analysis of the types of policy changes suggest that the overall effect on school segregation is driven by the school districts that replaced school desegregation plans with neighborhood-based assignment plans. Districts that replaced race considerations with socioeconomic factors and that expanded school choice options did not experience an increase in school segregation.Chapter 2 examines the impact of the changes in school desegregation plans documented in the Chapter 1 on ninth grade repetition rates in the same districts. Analysis of data from 1988 to 2012 suggests that the removal of school desegregation plans caused a statistically significant increase in the ninth grade repetition rates of about 0.2 standard deviations. I also find that the impact on the ninth grade repetition rates is driven by the school districts where school segregation was substantially increased due to the changes in desegregation policies. The impact on the ninth grade repetition rate is driven by the school districts where school segregation was substantially increased by the changes in desegregation policies. In addition, I find no evidence that the desegregation policy changes affect student movements from other districts or private schools.Chapter 3 examines the impact of school choice policy in Seoul, Korea on school segregation by student performance levels. Seoul, Korea replaced random assignment of schools with school choice in 2010. By exploiting the policy change, this paper examines the effect of school choice on student sorting by ability. I find that schools became segregated by student performance levels following the implementation of the school choice policy in Seoul. The results of this paper suggest that school choice increases school segregation by academic performance levels even in a racially homogenous country."
ecn_etd_95,"Three Essays on the Impact of Unemployment Insurance on Employment, Benefit Takeup and Other Labor Market Outcomes",Economics,"Employment, Layoff, Subsidies, Takeup, Unemployment insurance","This dissertation consists of three chapters on the impact of unemployment insurance on employment, benefit takeup and other labor market outcomes. Chapter one studies the short run employment effect of unemployment insurance policies in the United States by examining how the variations in average benefits, taxes, or subsidies per worker at major industry level in a state/year impact the industry employment level across states and over time. I build simulated instruments for the state UI policy measures to avoid endogeneity issue arise from using UI policy measures derived from administrative data on wages and taxes. I find that benefits have a positive effect while taxes have a negative effect on industry employment before I add the state year interaction term to the regressions. After adding the interaction term to account for the fact that states change their tax schedules often, annually if necessary to meet the need of balancing state UI trust fund, I find the effect of UI taxes and benefits goes away. I investigate further by regressing state average UI measures on lagged state unemployment rate and find clear evidence for policy endogeneity in state UI programs.The second chapter studies the effect of UI policy on benefit takeup rates. Although the Unemployment Insurance program in the United States provides almost universal coverage to wage and salary workers, the estimated takeup rates have been surprisingly low. Earlier research either uses state level data that do not explore the industry level differences in UI benefits and taxes, or uses administrative data to derive UI policy measures that are endogenous with takeup rates. This study applies instrumental variables of UI measures to analyze the takeup rates at industry level in a state year. I find the benefit elasticity of takeup is 0.81, very close to what Anderson and Meyer found in their 1997 study after adding the earnings spline to control for endogeneity. I also look at the effect of UI taxes on takeup rates and find very small and insignificant effect.Chapter three studies the effect of unemployment insurance benefits on temporary layoffs waiting to be recalled. Earlier work has used endogenous UI measures derived from individual data on benefits and wages. The main contribution of this paper is to use instrumental variables of UI benefits and taxes at industry-year-state level from all 50 states and D.C. to analyze temporary layoffs at the industry level. I use CPS Basic Monthly data from 1990 - 2002 for this study. I find an increase of average UI benefits by a standard deviation, about $100, leads to a 29.5% increase in temporary layoffs. I use the other unemployment - those unemployed that are looking for a job instead of waiting to be recalled as the ""control group"" and find higher benefits have no decisive or statistically significant effect on the other unemployment. I further analyze whether the increased observations of temporary layoffs come from higher incidence or longer durations and find higher benefits do no impact incidence of temporary layoffs in a statistically significant way, indicating that most of the increase of observations come from longer durations of temporary layoffs."
etd_454,Three Essays on the Impacts of Air Pollution and Environmental Policy,Economics,"Air Pollution, Environmental Economics, Environmental Policy","This dissertation analyzes the effects of United States environmental policy - specifically that which regards air pollution - on health, labor market, and environmental outcomes.  The first chapter examines the potential long-term effects of childhood exposure to atmospheric lead.  The outcome of interest is crime, and the policy analyzed is the leaded gasoline phaseout.  The second chapter seeks to investigate the effects of environmental regulation on labor markets.  Nonattainment status designation creates variation in regulatory levels across counties based on a county’s air quality for a given pollutant, in this case ozone.  The third chapter provides analysis of the design ramifications of the Acid Rain Program’s tradable permit market for sulfur dioxide established by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The study examines how the two-phase approach as well as the initial permit allocation rule affected emissions.  These studies all show evidence of the wide range of effects environmental policy can have."
etd_644,THREE ESSAYS ON THE LINKS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND PUBLIC FINANCE,Public Administration,"hedonic model, local government studies, school district consolidation, special district, state and local public finance, village dissolution","This dissertation, comprised of three essays, explains and evaluates local government structural changes from a public finance perspective. The first essay examines the determinants of the rapid growth of special districts, while the next two essays estimate the effects on property values of school district consolidation and village dissolution in New York State, respectively. Together, the three essays contribute to our understanding of the causes and consequences of local government structural changes in the United States.By bring together two central trends in state and local public finance, namely, the expansion of state-imposed tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) and the rapid growth of special districts, the first essay looks into the hypothesis that TELs are partly responsible for the increase of special districts over the last several decades. To eliminate the possible omitted variable bias, I employ a combination of fixed effects, regional time trends and approximate measures of fiscal conservativeness. Based on a national data set of counties over the period 1972-2007, I find TELs, on average, increase the use of special districts (circumvention effects), whereas TELs don’t force local governments to cut their intergovernmental fiscal transfer to special districts in the same county area (deterrent effects). The estimation results are robust to multiple tests of common trends assumptions, five alternative measures of TELs, alternative model specifications and different empirical strategies. This results confirm the theory that special districts have been extensively created by local general-purpose governments as an institutional strategy to circumvent the fiscal constraints imposed by TELs.The second essay explores the impacts of school district consolidation on property values in upstate New York from 2000 to 2012. This research, conducted in collaboration with Professors William Duncombe and John Yinger, adds a time dimension to research on the property-value impacts of consolidation. By combining propensity score matching and double-sales data to compare house value changes in consolidating and comparable school districts, we find that it takes time either for the advantages of consolidation to be apparent to homebuyers or for the people who prefer consolidated districts to move in. In addition, the long-run impacts of consolidation on house values are positive in low-income census tracts but negative in high-income census tracts. This result suggests that high-income households are particularly attached to the benefits, such as close contact with teachers, of small districts.Streams of institutional, economic and fiscal factors recently have been converging and substantially changing the landscape of local government in the United States. Dissolution, an old and new approach, has increasingly been used and therefore drawn much public attention nowadays. The third essay provides the first study investigating whether village dissolution, as a form of general-purpose government reorganization, affects the attractiveness of local communities. In New York, voters in several villages voted to dissolve the village and hence to shift all government services to the town government in which the village is located. I show that village dissolution does not alter the amount people are willing to pay inside the (eliminated) village boundaries, but that the price of housing declines in areas of the town outside the village (TOV). Presumably, residents in the TOV areas are upset with the negative externalities of village dissolution."
etd_642,Three Essays on the Origins and Consequences of Public Services Motives,Public Administration,,"This dissertation consists of three essays that examine the origins and consequences of public service motives.Essay 1 addresses the origins of public service motives by examining the contri-bution of genetic factors to individual differences in one motive thought to be related to participation and performance in public service - attraction to public policymaking - as well as mediators of genetic effects. In the particular sample of twins examined, approx-imately 31% of the phenotypic variance in attraction to public policymaking could be accounted for by genetic factors, while the remaining 69% of variance could be account-ed for by unshared environmental factors. Furthermore, the results show that approximately 30% of the total effect of genes on attraction to public policymaking is mediated by, or explained by, trait dominance. Results from a supplementary segmenta-tion analysis show that these effects are driven primarily by the males in the sample. For males, roughly 42% of the phenotypic variance in attraction to public policymaking could be accounted for by genetic factors, while genetic factors were statistically indis-tinguishable from zero in females. Furthermore, for males, approximately 43% of the total effect of genes on attraction to public policymaking was mediated by trait domi-nance. Results from a supplementary co-twin fixed effect analysis suggest that education and political ideology are strong environmental predictors of attraction to public policy-making. As a whole, the results suggest that that one type of motive related to participation and performance in public service – attraction to public policymaking – may be trait-like, heritable and explained by trait dominance. They also show that there appears to be sex-related differences in heritability. Finally, the results also suggest that education and political ideology may be causal environmental antecedents of attraction to public policymaking.Essay 2 addresses the origins of public service motives and reports the results of two studies that examine the intergenerational transmission of public sector employment. The data show that having a parent/head of household who was primarily employed in the public sector throughout their life is associated with an increased likelihood of being employed in the public sector. However, these effects are weak in terms of magnitude and the effect of the father weakens as one ages and is stronger for males compared to females. Having a spouse/partner employed in the public sector is also associated with an increased likelihood of being employed in the public sector. This association is stronger amongst newly married or cohabitating couples, which implies active mate choice rather than solely spousal socialization. The results suggest that public sector employment and, by extension, public service motives may be transmitted from generation to generation. The transmission process may be strengthened by positive assortative mating on public sector employment.Essay 3 addresses the consequences of public service motives and develops and tests a moderated mediation model of mission matching in which meaningfulness serves as an intervening mechanism that explains the association between mission matching and effort. It also considers how individual differences in prosocial motivation influence the intervening role of meaningfulness. Using a real-effort laboratory experiment with monetary incentives, the essays shows that matched subjects exert more effort than mismatched subjects, that this effect is mediated by increases in meaningfulness, that prosociality moderates the effect of a match on meaningfulness, and that the indirect effect of a match on effort via increases in meaningfulness varies as a function of prosociality. The essay suggests that public service motives matter for how meaningful a work experience is."

ecn_etd_93,Three Essays on the Quality of Marriage,Economics,"Causal Mechanisms, Chilean Divorce Law, Duration models, Labor force participation, Program Evaluation, Time to first birth","In these essays I focus on issues that affect the quality of marriage. First, I analyze the effect of the Chilean divorce law on a woman's decision of when to have the first child. Using survival analysis, I find that the divorce law has had a positive effect on the hazard for highly-educated women. This result suggests that highly-educated women may have waited to have the first child until they were able to afford the additional costs that a child may bring to a divorce process in case the couple decided to separate. In the second essay I analyze the relationship between domestic violence and marriage duration. Using a representative sample of Peru's female population between 15 and 49 years old, I find that domestic violence may increase the hazard of divorce. Moreover, I find that the change in the hazard varies over time, increasing immediately after the first physical or sexual aggression from the husband, and decreasing afterwards. In the third essay I evaluate the role of domestic violence as a causal mechanism in the effect of civil conflict violence on a woman's labor force participation. Using data on the civil conflict violence from Peru and assuming unconfoundedness, I find that the probability of working increased by 0.0454 (eight percent) for women who live in areas affected by the civil conflict and that about 27 percent of this increase is mediated by the woman's exposure to domestic violence."
etd_262,Three Essays on the Supply of Long-Term Care Services to the Elderly in the U.S.,Public Administration,"Adult Children, Caregiving, Long-Term Care, Medicaid, Physical Activity, Wealth","Situated in the context of a rapidly aging population, this dissertation examines the implications of supplying long-term care (LTC) services to the elderly in the United States. The first two essays investigate private costs of LTC assistance borne by adult children of elderly parents. In contrast, the third essay focuses on the cost of publicly-provided, formal LTC services.The first essay analyzes whether adult children devote less time to exercise as time allocation in parental caregiving increases. The empirical model is a system of four correlated equations, where the dependent variables are hours spent caregiving, frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity, and hours spent in paid work. I use pooled cross-sectional data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for this analysis. Results from joint estimation of the four equations indicate limited evidence of a competition between time spent in caregiving and frequency of physical activity. Parental factors that increase allocation of care time to parents do not comprehensively induce reductions in the frequency of any type of physical activity, nor in hours of work, among either men or women.The second essay goes beyond time resources and examines whether dementia onset in parents leads to a reduction in adult children’s household wealth. Towards this, I construct a longitudinal dataset from seven waves of HRS. Estimates from unconditional quantile regressions indicate that parental dementia substantially reduces household wealth of an unmarried adult child in the upper quantiles of the wealth change distribution in the first two years after parental diagnosis. These effects are more pronounced for unmarried adult children without siblings. Further, this response is observed to persist in the subsequent time period as well. An examination of mechanisms suggests that both, losses in labor income and nursing home expenditures, may play a role in leading to wealth declines. This paper makes two contributions: first, it focuses on a broader outcome of private cost, and second, unlike previous studies, it does not limit the analysis to adult children who are informal caregivers.The final essay examines the cost implications of publicly provided formal care services. Medicaid’s Personal Care Services (PCS) State Plan benefit is a key mechanism through which states provide personal assistance services to eligible beneficiaries. But, it is widely claimed that states are reluctant to adopt the program over fears of runaway spending. Surprisingly, there has been very little empirical work on examining the effect of the PCS State Plan benefit on Medicaid expenditures. Using aggregate state-level data from 1975 through 2009, this study finds that PCS State Plan adoption had no overall effect on Medicaid expenditures, except briefly during the early-growth years in 1980s. Further, findings suggest that states make decisions to adopt the program based on financial experiences of other adopting states. This study provides evidence consistent with the interpretation that when faced with the dilemma of balancing increased access and uncontrolled expenditures, state officials adapt the design of an entitlement benefit in an effort to make it less expensive.In its entirety, the dissertation provides new thinking on two dominant themes in conventional long-term care research: “caregiver burden” and “woodwork effect.” In particular, the results of the first and third essay question the presence of “caregiver burden” and “woodwork effect” respectively, while the third essay challenges the pervasiveness of “caregiver burden” among unmarried adult children. These findings, which in some aspect are unexpected in the context of existing literature, have important implications for policy intervention and the direction of future research efforts in this area."
etd_271,Three Essays on U.S. Social Policy’s Impact on the Human Capital Development of Young Adults At-Risk of Poverty,Public Administration,"At-risk young adults, Educational Attainment, Human Capital Development, Poverty, U.S. Social Welfare Policy, Work Experience","Social welfare programs and policies can have a variety of anticipated and unexpected effects on the human capital investments of young adults at-risk of living in poverty in the United States. My dissertation investigates how three large-scale public programs – means-tested, cash welfare (e.g., Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Temporary Aid to Needy Families), Medicaid health insurance for children, and the Social Security Student Benefit Program – affected the educational attainment and work experience of vulnerable young adults.In the first chapter, I examine how public policies encouraging labor force participation by low-skilled single mothers during welfare reform unintentionally led to labor supply declines by young, less-educated single males. While the labor market woes of low-skilled male workers over the past several decades have been well documented, the academic literature on the identification of causal factors leading to the decline in labor force participation (LFP) by young, low-skilled males is relatively scant. In this paper, I use a fixed-effects, instrumental variable research design to exploit the timing and characteristics of welfare reform policies to explore whether policies targeted to increase LFP rates for low-skilled single mothers inadvertently led to labor force exit of young, low-skilled males. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the series of work inducements enacted by states throughout the 1990s as a source of exogenous variation in a quasi-experimental design, I find that a welfare-reform-generated 10 percentage point (pp) increase in LFP for low-skilled single mothers resulted in a statistically significant 2.6 pp decline in LFP rates by young, low-skilled single males. Furthermore, after a series of alternative model specifications and robustness checks, I find that this result is driven entirely by the decline in labor supply for white males; young black males and other groups of workers appear to be unaffected by the labor supply response of less-educated single mothers to welfare reform.The second essay in my dissertation studies one of the long-term effects of the child Medicaid health insurance expansions. Prompted by the legislative decision to decouple child Medicaid benefits from cash welfare receipt, the number of young children qualifying for public health insurance grew markedly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. This chapter extends the academic literature examining early childhood investments and longer-term human capital measures by exploring whether public health insurance expansions to low-income children led to a greater number of high school completers in the 2000s. Using a technique developed by Currie and Gruber (1994, 1996) to simulate the generosity of a state’s Medicaid program during early childhood, I find large and significant effects on completion rates, which are examined in two forms: the dropout rate and the traditional four-year high school graduation rate. Intent-to-treat estimates range from a 1.9 to 2.5 pp decrease in the dropout rate for each 10 pp increase in early childhood years covered by the state-level Medicaid program. The same 10 percentage point increase in child Medicaid program generosity reveals increases of 1.0 to 1.3 pp when applied to four-year graduation rates, indicating that dropout reductions are propelled by increases in traditional diplomas. In addition, results appear to be driven by Hispanic and white students, the two groups which experienced the greatest within-group eligibility increases due to the decoupling of child Medicaid from the AFDC cash assistance program.My final dissertation chapter investigates how a particular college fund guarantee affected achievements in higher education. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979) and a difference-in-differences model, this work re-examines the impact of the Social Security Student Benefits Program (SSSBP) on post-secondary educational attainment, a topic first studied by Dynarski (2003). By exploiting a larger panel of data and exploring degree attainment at various ages, my coauthor and I find that disadvantaged youth potentially qualifying for SSSBP funds – e.g., those losing a father before they turned 18 – were over 20 pp more likely to obtain higher education degrees beyond their high school diploma than similar students who would have qualified for benefits, but-for the program’s termination in May 1982. Initial program impacts – i.e., those by age 23 – show an increase in Associate’s degree attainment. As these respondents age, however, many go on to obtain four year degrees. Impacts are large and statistically significant, and suggestive that social programs seeking to reduce the financial costs of Associate’s degrees – such as the one announced by President Obama in his 2015 State of the Union Address – could be well-targeted."

The goal of the research is to advance our understanding of the way discourses are related to the emergence of governance institutions, and to shed light on the socio-technical processes required to control dual-use information technology.The research applies theories and methods of science and technology studies and institutional theory to the debate over the production, sale and regulation of software vulnerabilities and exploits. To study the historical, organizational, and institutional developments of these markets and the control regimes, this qualitative, empirical research employed (1) a comprehensive document analysis of publicly accessible documents, including technical briefs, policy memos, and industry reports; and (2) conducted in-depth interviews with information security professionals and policy experts. The research analyzed the emerging institutions and the discourse from the early 1990s to 2015. In particular, it analyzed the actors, their concepts and ideas in the discursive exchanges and identified frames the actors used.The research identified four frames that shaped the discourse and contributed to the formation of market and control institutions: the ‘Duty to Disclose’ and ‘Market’ frames were relevant in the institutionalization of vulnerability trading; and the ‘Controlling the Digital Arms Trade’ and ‘Controlling the Proliferation of Cyber Weapons’ frames explained the adoption of export control regimes to regulate the global trade in software exploits and surveillance technology."

etd_207,Topics in Supersymmetry: Implications for Cosmology and Non-Perturbative Studies on a Spacetime Lattice,Physics,"Cosmology, Lattice, Supersymmetry","Moduli fields, scalar fields which parametrize different vacuum states of a given theory, are commonly predicted to exist within compactifications of UV complete theories, and in particular those theories exhibiting supersymmetry. But if such theories' dynamics are present during the inflationary phase of the universe and thereafter, what are the implications for cosmology and the evolution of the universe? In this thesis a review is presented on generic consequences of the presence of these scalar fields during inflation and the post-inflationary era of the universe. An unexpected consequence arises in the study of dark matter production, where a deviation from the usual thermal production mechanism is shown to be required.In addition to studies in cosmology, the dynamics of a twisted construction of supersymmetric lattice quantum field theory is explored. An analysis of the fermionic sign problem is presented and it is shown to be absent in the studied formulation. A first study of the phase structure of supersymmetric N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is also presented."
etd_471,Touring Extinction: The Rhetorics of Biodiversity Loss on Display,Communication and Rhetorical Studies,"Ecology, Extinction, Museums, Pedagogy, Rhetoric, Tourism","This thesis contends that communication scholars ought to investigate how and to what effect individual/collective rhetors seek to persuade humans about their interconnectedness with nonhumans and the physical world. Specifically, the author draws on his participant-observations of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, New York, to rhetorically analyze the ways in which the institution renders intelligible to tourists the sixth mass extinction in natural history, an event known as the Holocene Extinction. By touring the American Museum and documenting his experiences through a series of critical vignettes, the author demonstrates how the institution, namely the Hall of Biodiversity, seeks to create an entangled public, or a collectivity of humans that see their wellbeing and the survival of the more-than-human world as entangled. As an outcome of this thesis, the author theorizes what he calls pedagogies of entanglement to refer to a class of instructional discourses that manifest in/through communication about the relationship between humans and the more-than-human world, a nascent phenomenon that he argues appears within and beyond the American Museum. To that end, the author calls for a more robust engagement with the pedagogies of entanglement that populate the discourses of other overlapping technical and public spheres. Doing so will provide rhetoricians with the opportunity to assess the effectivity of other situated pedagogies of entanglement in order to offer tools and recommendations to better human communication about the more-than-human world."

As a field to study friendships among adults with intellectual disability label, I gained access to two sheltered workshops (""The Farm"" in the U.S. and ""The Kapu Kapu"" in Japan) and conducted participant observation, through which I wished to identify broader, multiple, and more humane ways to define competence and human value that could validate people labeled intellectually disabled whose humanity and citizenship are often doubted by dominant standards in industrialized societies. In addition to resisting social standards and presenting broader meanings of participation and competence, the informants of this study seemed to try to resist giving significant authority to the concepts of competence and utility in relation to human worth and to build community that does not question who should or should not be the valid members of the community. The observed communities helped me to imagine a different, more just world, and were characterized as ""co-vivial"" (a term coined by a Japanese philosopher to mean ""live with different others convivially""). The informants of this study cultivated co-vivial communities by staying connected, seeing others as irreplaceable individuals, being responsive to others, being open to interdependent way of life, and affirming every existence unconditionally."
etd_2,Toward Computationally Lightweight Stationary and Mobile Computer Vision-based Traffic Surveillance for Assistive Devices in Intelligent Transportation Systems,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Assistive Devices, Embedded Smart Cameras, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Lightweight Algorithms, Traffic Surveillance Systems","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is a technology that is currently tightly integrated into virtually every aspect of the nation's infrastructure. The high flexibility of vision sensors, as well as their low cost, have proven to be a driving force in the advancement of computer vision for traffic surveillance. Although many advances have been made to existing traffic surveillance systems for various ITS applications, another side of the ITS industry — advanced driver assistance systems — has not been as quick to develop. With recent advances in embedded systems, such as the introduction of low-power embedded smart cameras, potential safety applications can begin to be developed for the consumer market.The goal of this research is to highlight and provide a solution to several key problems facing any ITS-related computer vision application:1. Lack of hardware-independent and portable solutions for traffic surveillance from either a moving or a static platform;2. Absence of computer vision-based systems that do not require strict positioning guidelines and interaction with the user for proper operation;3. No cost-effective solutions exist for ITS traffic monitoring applications that can be easily deployed by the customer; and4. Lack of generalized algorithms for prototyping and designing lightweight ITS computer vision-based algorithms for embedded smart camera platforms.Even current state-of-the-art research and commercially-available computer-vision products designed for the ITS industry are highly dependent on camera localization and a perfect set of conditions during initialization.Driver assistance systems— systems that are installed within the vehicle, designed to provide feedback to the driver — are highly dependent on the angle of the camera for proper detection or require a manual definition of regions-of-interest (ROI), in addition to relying on sensors other than cameras for proper operation; andtraffic surveillance systems— systems that observe traffic from a stationary point — require post-install vendor support for manually defining ROI or adjusting the camera angle for proper detection. No automated and position-independent image processing solutions exist, much less any generalized lightweight algorithms for designing and prototyping ITS-related computer vision-based algorithms.Algorithms for static and mobile vehicle detection and tracking are developed in this dissertation, which include headlight and taillight tracking, traffic pattern analysis for ROI extraction, and vehicle counting for connected vehicle applications. As a capstone proof-of-concept, a system for detecting, tracking, and reporting the state of traffic signal lights is developed, with potential applications for colorblind and vision-deficient users.When examined collectively, the results presented in this dissertation demonstrate that a reliable ITS-related system can be achieved using only a monocular camera, without the need (when appropriate) for costly sensor-fusion approaches. Instead of sensor fusion,fusion of lightweight algorithmsis used to develop ITS algorithms that are less computationally expensive and, in a number of scenarios, more reliable than similar approaches.In addition, the results show that most ITS computer vision algorithms can be implemented on embedded smart cameras, minimizing the overall system cost and power requirements. Such results are especially important when designing cost-effective commercial driver assistance systems and traffic surveillance systems."
scied_etd_24,"Toward Understanding ""Teaching in the Making:"" Explaining Instructional Decision Making by Analyzing a Geology Instructor's Use of Metaphors",Science Teaching,"Earth science education, Metaphor, Pedagogical context knowledge, Teacher development","There is a need to enhance science and geoscience literacy. Effective instruction allows students opportunity to build their own models, test them, make their own arguments, and discern reliability of the claims and arguments of others. Attempts at designing and importing such instruction have shown limited implementation fidelity, even with attached professional development. Up to present, attempts to understand the problem of implementation sought to focused on the context of the teacher (beliefs, knowledges, and motivations) to explain teacher practice, and results indicate great complexity. Maintaining a similar focus, this investigation analyzes a geology instructor's use of metaphor, when talking about teaching, learning, and knowledge, to understand and explain the factors involved in his instructional decision making.     Eric (pseudonym), a geology professor, implemented a curricular intervention in two successive introductory geology classes. However, Eric selected and amended only particular facets of the intervention. The research utilizes classroom observations and multiple audio recorded meetings with Eric to understand why he chose and amended certain parts of the intervention and not others. Results show that Eric described his teaching in terms of two metaphors: the puzzle metaphor and the field trip metaphor. The metaphors paralleled each other in terms how Eric saw his role, his students' role and the role and the nature of knowledge, and therefore influenced what and how he taught. This study suggests that curriculum designers need to take instructor context into consideration when designing curricular interventions and analyzing for the use of metaphor may be an effective way to discern that context."
etd_729,TOWARDS A METHOD OF BELONGING: CONTEXTUALIZING GENDER VIOLENCE IN M?ORI WORLDS,Cultural Foundations of Education,"Aotearoa, Maori, New Zealand, Violence, Wahine, Whanau","This embodied, storied research engages the project of decolonizing gender violation by examining how the production of contemporary violences impacting M?ori (indigenous peoples of Aotearoa/New Zealand) is undergirded by both struggles for land and intimate relationality. These struggles/positionings and the violences they produce shape our social relations and belongings. The thesis utilizes textual analysis of p?r?kau (contextualized stories) and m?teatea (sung poetry), 19th century Native Land Court cases, 20th century biographic writing, and in-person interviews to produce a new p?r?kau—one that maps circuits of marginalization and belonging across three generations of M?ori women in the author’s family. Utilizing analytics of disappearing/reappearing, entanglement/relating, and hunger/homelessness/hysteria, I work to map the ways colonial proximities (enacted by settlers and M?ori) foreshadow the violences that come to be visited on bodies already made marginal. I also place these violences on a genealogy that includes pre-contact stories as a means by which to make space for a more nuanced and vibrant accounting of our histories—histories marked by a full and fragile humanity. By making visible racialized and classed variations in property rights, mobility, and agency I make critical interruptions concerning the stability of the binary indigenous/settler, as well as the utility of culture and return as viable decolonizing frameworks. Instead, my work with the textual archive suggests the need for a multiplicity of stories—particularly those that rehabilitate, reanimate, and recenter our female ancestors. My work suggests that healing our stories in this way can also become a powerful method of belonging for those who have been taken or lost."
phi_etd_75,Towards a Revisionist Account of Moral Responsibility,Philosophy,"free will, moral responsibility, revisionism","Revisionism is the view that we would do well to distinguish between what we think about moral responsibility and what we ought to think about it, that the former is in some important sense implausible and conflicts with the latter, and so we should revise our concept of moral responsibility accordingly. There are three main challenges for a successful revisionist account of moral responsibility: (i) it must meet the diagnostic challenge of identifying our folk concept and provide good reason to think that significant features of this concept are implausible, (ii) it must meet the motivational challenge and explain why, in light of this implausibility, our folk concept ought to be revised rather than eliminated, and (iii) it must meet the prescriptive challenge and provide an account of how, all things considered, we ought to revise our thinking about moral responsibility. In order to meet (iii) revisionism must provide a prescriptive account of responsibility that is free of the problematic features of our folk concept identified in meeting the diagnostic challenge, is naturalistically plausible, normatively adequate, and justifies our continued participation in the practice of moral praising and blaming. So, while the first of these three challenges is primarily concerned with the nature of our concepts, the latter two move to questions about whether or not, to use Dennett's terms, we can defend and accept an account of moral responsibility ""worth wanting.""     In my dissertation I raise a new problem for revisionism, the normativity-anchoring problem. The heart of this problem is that the methodological commitments used to motivate revisionism and distinguish the view from conventional theorizing about moral responsibility make it uniquely difficult for revisionists to justify our continued participation in the practice of moral praising and blaming. Following Manuel Vargas, who has thus far developed and defended the view most rigorously, revisionists endorse the following skeptical claim: it is possible that our intuitions fail to inform us about what responsibility is, and furthermore we lack good epistemic reasons for thinking that they ever do. For conventional theorists, the fact that a particular account of responsibility best aligns with our refined intuitions, beliefs, and theoretical commitments is reason enough, ceteris paribus, to endorse that view. But revisionists who endorse the skeptical claim must find some alternative method for arguing that their prescriptive account is one that we should in fact endorse. One alternative, suggested by Vargas himself, is to show that the prescriptive account in question justifies our continued participation in the practice of moral praising and blaming, and preserves the ""work of the concept."" However, I argue that Vargas' own claim that the prescriptive account he offers promotes an independently valuable form of agency fails to bridge the gap between axiological claims about value and normative claims about how we should treat responsible agents. Moreover, bridging this gap looks to be a serious problem for any form of revisionism which shares the methodological commitments used to motivate the view thus far, and so further development of revisionism requires having a solution to the normativity-anchoring problem in hand.     I go on to develop a new revisionist strategy that avoids the normativity-anchoring problem. I propose and defend a new methodological assumption (hereafter referred to as MAP) that I argue revisionists can and should accept, capable of preserving the skeptical spirit of revisionism while identifying a particular class of intuitions about moral responsibility as having a privileged epistemic status. In particular, I argue that revisionists can and should accept that widespread judgments about responsibility generated by concrete cases which elicit a strong affective response in the person making the judgment have a privileged epistemic status in our responsibility theorizing. My arguments in support of this assumption depend on an analogy between the responsibility judgments in question and the kinds of paradigmatic judgments which constrain our ethical theorizing more generally. Having established this analogy I then offer a series of companions in guilt style arguments for the claim that the epistemic status of these two kinds of judgments should stand and fall together. I conclude that the responsibility judgments in question should ultimately share the privileged status of the paradigmatic ethical judgments in question, and thus play an evidentiary role in our theorizing about moral responsibility. If these arguments are successful then acceptance of the methodological assumption I defend allows revisionists to avoid the normativity-anchoring problem while preserving the unique methodological spirit which motivates revisionism and sets it apart from conventional theorizing about moral responsibility."

A service-oriented enterprise is an emerging architecture of the firm that leverages the paradigm of services computing to integrate the capabilities of the firm with the complementary competencies of business partners to offer customers with value-added products and services. Design science research in information systems was employed to pursue the primary design of a cloud business integration platform to enable the secondary design of multi-enterprise business processes to enable the dynamic and effective integration of business partner capabilities with those of the enterprise. The results from the study received industry acclaim for the designed solutions innovativeness and business results in the case study environment. The research makes contributions to the IT practitioner and scholarly knowledge base by providing insight into key constructs associated with service-oriented design and deployment of a cloud enterprise architecture and cloud intermediation model to achieve business results. The study demonstrated how an outside-in service-oriented architecture adoption pattern and cloud computing model enabled a medium-sized manufacturing enterprise to focus on a comprehensive approach to business partner integration and collaboration. The cloud integration platform has enabled a range of secondary designs that leveraged business services to orchestrate inter-enterprise business processes for choreography into service systems and networks for the purposes of value creation. The study results demonstrated enhanced levels of business process agility enabled by the cloud platform leading to secondary designs of transactional, differentiated, innovative, and improvisational business processes. The study provides a foundation for future scholarly research on the role of cloud integration platforms in enterprise computing and the increased importance of service-oriented secondary designs to exploit cloud platforms for sustained business performance."
mae_etd_70,Towards Closed Loop Control of a High-Speed Jet for Noise Reduction,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Aeroacoustics, Flow Control, Jet Noise, Jets, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, Time resolved PIV","This body of work seeks to explore novel methods for reducing aeroacoustically generated noise through the introduction of localized perturbations around the periphery of a Mach 0.6 unheated 2-inch jet. Simultaneous measurements of the hydrodynamic pressure field are acquired at discrete axial locations downstream of the nozzle exit (3 and 6 jet diameters downstream), alongside simultaneous measurements of the far-field acoustic signature. We assess the effectiveness of both open loop and closed loop flow control studies as they compare to an uncontrolled jet, through the examination of resultant modifications to the low dimensional characteristics of the jet. Also assessed is the nature of the changes to the spectral content and subsequent cross-correlations between the near-field and far-field regions. The open loop control studies include a series of investigations geared towards characterizing the effectiveness of the chosen control device, a piezoelectrically driven synthetic jet actuation system, in exciting different instabilities. The test metric spans an array of cases in which the excitation frequency was varied at constant momentum flux and the momentum flux was varied at one constant excitation frequency. Also investigated was the effect of an amplitude modulated input signal, as well as forcing different asymmetric modes, in an open loop sense. Results suggest that the shear layer is very receptive to relatively low energy instabilities introduced at the lip. The magnitude of the spectral density plots are amplified in certain frequency bands, and in some cases the peak frequency location is shifted from its baseline location. The cross-correlations exhibit significant phase lag and strong periodicity as a result of a sinusoidal forcing of the developing shear layer. For all open loop control cases the far-field acoustic signature was increased. Phase two of the investigation employed the use of a simple proportional closed loop controller. The information used in the feedback loop was garnered from the spatial Fourier mode filtered pressure information acquired with the azimuthal array of pressure sensors. The experimental set-points were cycled through feeding back either Fourier mode 0 or 1 acquired at either of the two downstream pressure measurement locations. This information was used to dynamically amplitude modulate the driving signal sent to the synthetic jet actuators. It was found that the changes to the correlations between the various measurement locations were not as prominent, but there was a resultant reduction of ~1.22 dB in the OASPL at far-field regions closest to the jet axis.The second wave of experiments incorporated the use of a time resolved particle image velocimetry system that allowed for measurement of the instantaneous radial and axial components of the velocity field along the jet centerline, from the exit of the nozzle to 7.5 diameters downstream, at a rate of 10 kHz. These measurements were taken in a simultaneous fashion with that of the near-field pressure and the far-field noise. These studies are limited to the analysis of one open loop control case against that of the uncontrolled jet. Cross correlations were performed exploring how both near-field Fourier filtered pressure and low dimensional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes relate to the far-field acoustics. Of interest are those signatures which exhibit the strongest correlation with the far-field, and subsequently how these structures can be controlled. It was found that almost none of the lower order time dependent POD modes of the velocity field correlate to the far-field, except at regions near the collapse of the potential core where POD modes a6(t) and a14(t) exhibit approximately a 10% correlation. The goal was to investigate how flow-induced perturbations of the developing shear layer might bring insight into how one may alter the flow such that the far-field acoustic signature is mitigated. The TR-PIV measurements will prove to be a powerful tool in being able to track the propagation of physical structures for both the controlled and uncontrolled jet."
etd_296,Trace Metal Characterization and Ion Exchange Capacity of Devonian to Pennsylvanian Age Bedrock in New York and Pennsylvania in Relation to Drinking Water Quality,Earth Sciences,"Drinking Water Hazards, Ion Exchange, Natural Water Hazards, Trace Metals","I report the results of an evaluation on the factors that control the quality of potable water produced in domestic and other wells in the shallow sedimentary rock formations of the Appalachian Basin. I collected 49 samples from the upper 120 meters of Devonian to Pennsylvanian aged bedrock between Marcellus, NY and State College, PA and analyzed their bulk geochemical composition. In particular, I quantified the mobile and total metals for which there are health concerns related to unconventional gas exploitation in the Appalachian Basin; Fe, Mn, Sr, Ba, As, and Pb. Measured bulk concentrations for several formations reached maximum concentrations of 65 ppm As, 4,900 ppm Ba, 63,000 ppm Fe, 130 ppm Ni, and 68 ppm Pb.To assess the mobility of these metals in the subsurface I used a variation of the U.S. Geological Survey Field Leaching Test. Metals such as Al, Zn, and U potentially can be leached from aquifer rocks naturally under acidic conditions, such as where pyrite might oxidize, to above current allowable regulatory values for these metals (2 mg/L, 5 mg/L, and 0.03 mg/L respectively) from some of the clay-rich formations. Small percentages (typically <1%) of the bulk concentrations were mobilized into solution but were still sufficient to exceed current EPA drinking water maximum contaminant levels (MCL) in many of the samples. In total, 74% of our samples exceeded MCL values for Al, 18% for As, 6% for Fe, 12% for Mn, 98% for Pb (above MCL Goal of 0 ppb), and 70% for U (above MCL Goal of 0 ppb).Groundwater analyses from both New York and Pennsylvania show that natural ion exchange occurs along flow paths from ridge tops to valleys.  I measured the total cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the samples and observed that they do not span the expected values for illite-rich clays (typically 10-40 milliequivalents/100g) commonly found in the Appalachian Basin. Instead, 88% of the samples had CEC values below 10 meq/100g with only 1 sample above 20 meq/100g. I quantified the hypothetical ground water flow path lengths necessary for the observed cation exchange to occur along fracture planes by combining CEC values with surface area measurements on three samples which ranged from 10.32-13.59 m2/g. These three estimates resulted in plausible flow path lengths of 2 km, 3 km, and 30 km.Many state and federal regulations do not require water from domestic wells or groundwater samples collected for metal analysis to be filtered. I argue that these regulations expose residents to drinking water with turbidity caused by suspended minerals that have metals attached leading to total concentrations at or above the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) MCL levels. I quantified the effects of turbid water at the EPA MCL of 5 NTU and improper filtration of turbid groundwater samples at the EPA MCL of 10 NTU on total metal concentrations used to trigger regulatory compliance related to possible contamination and health effects.Along with this broad scale study area I compared my geochemical results to the Fiorentino II (2015) study on a Devonian outcrop 4 miles North of Cortland, NY to evaluate small-scale trace metal heterogeneity within a single stratigraphic section. My regional collection of single data points at outcrops plotted within the 10th and 90th percentiles of the small-scale outcrop study. Together these two studies provide important information to determine the extent to which ground water might be naturally high in trace metal composition, either because of geochemical conditions or entrainment of suspended material not removed prior to sampling."

etd_726,Trading Dynamics in a Fragmented Market,Finance,"algorithmic trading, Market fragmentation, market microstructure","In this dissertation, we study the effect of recent regulatory and technological changes on tradingdynamics. Advances in communication and computing technologies have made millisecondlatencies as the new trading standard and have resulted in a new era of automated trading. Theintroduction of Reg-NMS (Regulation National Market System, implemented in 2007) has setstrict rules for the access and removal of liquidity from the fragmented US equity market, defacto linking the trading activities across trading venues. These transformations have not onlychanged how equity markets function but also how market participants interact with the marketand among themselves.We begin this study by examining how the introduction of Reg-NMS has affected the tradingstrategies of fast, impatient traders. The implementation of Rule 611, which extends price priorityacross all the trading venues in the National Market System, forces them to monitor all tradingvenues in order to correctly asses the placement of their orders. We find evidence that becauseof their impatient nature, these traders react to all events that negatively affect the position oftheir orders, regardless of the venue of origin. This behavior results in an order flow that is madeup of a high volume of very short-lived limit orders, which is consistent with a previously studied,but not yet fully explained, phenomenon of fleeting liquidity.IIWe then investigate whether fast, impatient traders are able to leverage their speed advantageto turn market fragmentation in their favor. We find evidence that their ability to anticipate theorder flow of the other market participants, allows them to engage in a trading strategy thatrelies on the simultaneous submission of multiple orders across exchanges. Such strategy, calledOverbooking, aims at executing only one of these orders rather than all of them and uses theavailability of multiple exchanges to increase the probability of execution while limiting the riskof over execution thanks to their speed advantage.Overall, our findings show that a sub group of traders was not only able to adapt to a changingtrading environment but actually take advantage of it. The Overbooking trading strategy iseffective at increasing the probability of execution while also decreasing execution time and it isparticularly effective for stocks with a high degree of competition for superior queue placement.This suggests that the ability to effectively trade on multiple venues simultaneously allows fast,impatient traders to avoid engaging in a costly algorithmic battle for a favorable queueplacement, or submitting very aggressively priced limit orders, to attain quick execution.Moreover, our findings show that the actions of these traders, driven by their fast, and impatientnature and constrained by the complex rules that regulate liquidity access and provision on theNational Market System, result in the linking of order flow dynamics across trading venues. Wefind that the cancellation of an order can be determined by changes that have occurredelsewhere in the market and that to model correctly order flow dynamics it is necessary toinclude in the analysis the changes that occur on all trading venues. We also find that fast,impatient traders, actively monitor the state of all trading venues after order submission, andthat they benchmark the present state of the market to the state at submission."
etd_459,Trans Gender Embodied States of Recognition: Fragmented Citizenship and Agency,Sociology,"agency, citizenship, identification documents, identity, transgender","At the heart of this project is an analysis of how people who gender transition, broadly known by, and through, the term “transgender,” determine and achieve recognition and belonging – two fundamental aspects of personhood and citizenship. Gender transition processes uniquely unfold along the gender binary, in some cases reinforcing and/or resisting it. One’s gender transition ultimately influences their decisions to legally amendment aspects of their identity. Currently, the United States does not have a unified policy across federal, state, and local governance that enables name and sex designation changes on identification documents (IDs) and personal records. Given this multi-scalar character of U.S. ID governance and the use of binary sex designations, amending IDs and records to achieve (trans)recognition and (trans)belonging is neither singular nor permanent processes. Rather, they involve ongoing articulations and encounters that require navigating a multitude of social and structural factors.This dissertation project uses an online survey (N=882) and semi-structured interviews (N=50) to investigate three broad research questions: (1) Do individual ID/record amendment decisions vary among transpeople? (2) In what ways do multi-scalar U.S. policies produce fragmented citizenship recognition? (3) How do transpeople navigate and manage these policies and the fragmentation they create? This project concerns the overall experience of transgender people, and also engages in a comparative analysis of two groups of transpeople. The analytic categories I create include, TransNormative, which represents participants who identify within the gender binary (e.g., man or woman), and TransQueer, which represents participants who identify outside of, or in resistance to, the binary (e.g., genderqueer or part-time in either gender). These distinct categories illuminate the uniqueness and similarities among and between transpeople according to their attitudes, experiences, and the outcomes of managing the assemblage of IDs.Results demonstrate that transgender people, overall, are invested in practices that enable recognition and belonging, especially via pronouns, names, sex categorization, and photographs. Yet, there are multiple pathways in which recognition and belonging are achieved. Broadly, the TransNormative group invests in the notion, and institutional processes, of alignment – aligning their gender embodiment, pronouns, names, and sex designations to most often reflect the gender binary. The TransQueer group invests in practices of authentic representation that purposefully challenge the binary, and also point out the impossibility as state designations do not offer options beyond “m” or “f.”My work engages the concept of fragmented citizenship by focusing on how inconsistencies across federal, state, and local jurisdictions disrupt linked technologies of recognition – particularly through identification documents. Fragmented citizenship is also created through social interactions within and across spaces. (Trans)Recognition and (trans) belonging are dependent on agents’ interpretation of the in/congruence between gender embodied identity and identity markers on IDs. The experience of fragmented citizenship leads transpeople to practice distinctive navigation and management strategies. For example, the TransNormative group use IDs that portray most up-to-date photographs, carry cash instead of credit cards, and de-gender IDs, while the TransQueer group intentionally seek to disrupt gender attribution and categorization processes.I argue that the effect of multi-scalar and multi-spatial fragmented citizenship produces a kind of precarious citizenship, which temporarily or more permanently suspends or expels one from citizenship practices (e.g., education, employment, travel, consumption, etc.). Particular dimensions of precarity are shaped, in part, by one’s orientation toward or away from the gender binary. One’s orientation influences transition-related decisions and the types of amendments desired and made, as well as prioritizing the specific IDs to amend. Despite the haunting effects of both fragmented and precarious citizenship, transgender people are not passive, but rather actively pursue recognition and forms of belonging given their social positions and contexts. This research contributes to the fields of sociology, citizenship studies, and critical trans studies by situating individual, agentic desires of recognition and belonging in relation to social processes and institutional power."
etd_275,TRANSFER RATES AND BACCALAUREATE ATTAINMENT:  TWO-YEAR VERSUS HYBRID COLLEGES,Higher Education,"Attainment, Baccalaureate, Completion, Hybrid, Transfer, Two-year","This exploratory study examined how beginning at a hybrid college that offered baccalaureate degrees while retaining its subbaccalaureate mission of associate degrees and certificates (Floyd &;; Skolnik, 2005; Lorenzo, 2005), as compared to a beginning at a two-year college, affected transfer and baccalaureate attainment. Additionally, it determined how social background, other precollege personal characteristics, external demands as students enter college, and experiences during college affected transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment in the same manner as Dougherty and Kienzl (2006).This study assumed a quasiexperimental design with an ex post facto, causal-comparative case control analysis (Sprinthall, 2003). It used information from the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Study (NCES, 2008a) and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988 (NCES, 2008b) and data was collected from 60 hybrid or treatment colleges and 469 two-year or control colleges where students had begun their postsecondary education. The treatment groups consisted of 149 students from the BPS dataset and 230 students from the NELS dataset. The control groups had 1,168 students from the BPS dataset and 2,354 students from the NELS dataset.Descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses were used to understand the differences between the treatment group and the control group in relation to transfer and baccalaureate attainment. Additionally, Pearson correlation and bivariate analyses via logistic regression were used to further understand transfer and baccalaureate attainment overall by controlling for students’ background characteristics.Students who attended hybrid colleges were significantly less likely to transfer (with mixed results between the chi-squared and logistic regressions), had a significantly higher likelihood of attaining baccalaureate degrees when combining the first and second degree attained, and had a significantly higher likelihood of obtaining a baccalaureate degree overall—even when the results controlled for a number of potentially confounding background and experiential factors— than students who attended two-year colleges. These results provided preliminary evidence for the need for further investigation in examining the influence of hybrid colleges on student transfer patterns and baccalaureate attainment."

Following high frequency scattering solution of a large uniaxial sphere, the Mie series summation is split into the high frequency (HF) and low frequency terms where the HF term is replaced by its asymptotic expression allowing a significant reduction in computation time of the numerical Bromwich integral.In the second approach, the generalized Debye series for a radially uniaxial dielectric sphere is introduced and the Mie series coefficients are replaced by their equivalent Debye series formulations. The results are then applied to examine the transient response of each individual Debye term allowing the identification of impulse returns in the transient response of the uniaxial sphere.In the third approach, the ray tracing theory in a uniaxial sphere is investigated to evaluate the propagation path as well as the arrival time of the ordinary and extraordinary returns in the transient response of the uniaxial sphere. This is achieved by extracting the reflection and transmission angles of a plane wave obliquely incident on the radially oriented air-uniaxial and uniaxial-air boundaries, and expressing the phase velocities as well as the refractive indices of the ordinary and extraordinary waves in terms of the incident angle, optic axis and propagation direction. The results indicate a satisfactory agreement between Debye series , Mie series and ray tracing methods."
etd_675,Transitioning to Sustainable Civil Infrastructure Systems: Green Stormwater Management and Engineering Design Thinking,Civil and Environmental Engineering,"concept inventory, engineering education, green infrastructure, social-ecological system, stormwater management, technology adoption","Green infrastructure has been endorsed by many practitioners and organizations as a more sustainable approach to stormwater management. Decisions on how to best design municipal green infrastructure systems can be complicated by factors such as uncertainties about the performance and public acceptance of particular technologies. Thus, deciding how to design sustainable stormwater management systems requires engineers not only to reflect upon the fundamental principles used to conceptualize their designs, but also to consider how a broad array of social, economic, and environmental factors both influence and are influenced by their work.This thesis examines factors that influence the design and adoption of sustainable civil infrastructure systems in two research areas: (1) municipal stormwater management decisions in the United States, and (2) student understanding of engineering design principles. The objective of this thesis is to identify elements of engineering design and related decision-making processes that can provide engineers, stormwater management stakeholders, and engineering educators with lessons and tools that can advance the sustainable development of stormwater management systems.One challenge to understanding how particular factors may lead to sustainable outcomes is devising a tractable way to organize and document them. Using observations from national meetings and an extensive literature review, I develop a social-ecological framework for identifying factors that condition the adoption of green infrastructure technologies by stormwater management authorities. Findings from this work demonstrate a need to more fully develop robust descriptions of technological attributes within a social-ecological framework for urban stormwater systems, particularly for technology decision-making activities such as green infrastructure adoption.Understanding past outcomes of engineering planning within a particular context can provide useful insight for future decision-making. I conduct a case study on the evolution of stormwater management planning in Onondaga County, New York between 1998 and 2009, in which plans for certain unpopular gray infrastructure technologies were eventually replaced in part by a large-scale green infrastructure program. I find that the adoption of this program was driven by an alignment of several sociopolitical factors, including the presence of a policy entrepreneurship coalition in support of alternative stormwater management plans, the election of a key political official who acknowledged the needs of local stakeholders, and a shift in mindset of local and national officials as to what technologies are effective for stormwater management.A growing number of U.S. cities are adopting green infrastructure programs for stormwater management, particularly for combined sewer overflow mitigation. Viewing green infrastructure program adoption in combined sewer communities as a policy innovation, I develop an empirical model to differentiate factors associated with a sewer management authority’s binary decision to adopt or not adopt a large-scale green infrastructure program, and factors associated with decisions related to the extent of planned program implementation. This study finds that the binary decision to adopt a municipal green infrastructure program for combined sewer overflow management is largely driven by municipal population size and precipitation characteristics, while the extent of program implementation is also driven by socioeconomic characteristics of municipal residents and the amount of total capital needs required to achieve combined sewer overflow compliance.Engineers must be able to mathematically model the complexities of fundamental physical processes within real systems, such as green infrastructure systems for stormwater management. Many engineering processes are built upon fundamental concepts of mass and energy balances, in which mathematical models are used to analyze rates of change and accumulated quantities across system boundaries of interest. The Rate and Accumulation Concept Inventory (RACI) is an assessment tool that I developed to measure students’ mathematical and physical understandings of such concepts. I use data from an administration of the RACI (N=305) to assess evidence of the tool’s validity and reliability through structural equation modeling and multidimensional item response theory. Validity and reliability evidence indicates that the RACI can appropriately be used to measure students’ overall understanding of rate and accumulation processes.Case-based teaching methods have been suggested as a best practice for introducing students to ethical decision-making scenarios. By sensitizing future engineers to the concerns of stakeholders who are impacted by engineering decisions, educators can better prepare them to create designs that address social outcome criteria such as welfare and justice. Using case study findings related to stakeholder concerns and engineering decisions for stormwater management planning in Onondaga County, I develop a case-based teaching module on engineering decision-making for use in undergraduate civil and environmental engineering courses. Assessments from three years of module implementation demonstrate that the module can be used to meet multiple learning objectives and enhance student understanding of stakeholder engagement principles."
etd_513,"Transnational Genre Hybridity and the British Horror Film, 2002-2012",English,,"The first decade of the twenty-first century saw a significant increase in the production, profitability, and prestige of British horror films, since labeled “the resurgence.” Scholarship has focused on how a number of these films relate to contemporary politics regarding gender, the family, and class, and the films’ genre hybridity has been taken somewhat for granted as a given feature of postmodern filmmaking. While broader work on British cinema has shifted from national cinema studies to address the transnational, focus on this decade of British horror has remained firmly rooted in the national. My dissertation responds to both threads of conversation by reframing the films’ generic hybridity, not as postmodern intertextuality or blank pastiche but as explicitly transnational in nature. I argue that the British horror resurgence enacts what I call transnational genre hybridity in response to discourses in middle-class British film culture that condemn Americanization and frame the horror genre as unable to address contemporary cultural concerns. Further, my project analyzes this hybridity as a strategy of cultural legitimation that would locate contemporary horror as a worthy part of British national cinema, prompting a rethinking of the boundaries of British cinema, the functions of genre hybridity, and how we define the transnational.My dissertation situates the resurgence at the intersection of two contexts: broader British sociohistorical concerns and specific discourses circulating within the national film culture in which the films were conceived, produced, and received. I investigate how these films self-reflexively draw on formal and narrative tropes specifically deployed by horror subgenres associated with other national cinemas as well as longstanding and emergent British genres; my project argues that this transnational genre hybridity positions the films within larger discourses in middle-class British film culture, including debates about what constitutes British national cinema in contradistinction to a global cinema and industry. To this end, chapter one provides a contextual overview of middle-class British film culture during the 1990s and 2000s. I trace the shifts in three specific strains of discourse: an anti-Americanization discourse that framed the American film industry and its cinema as an colonizing invader; a saved/doomed binary wherein each British film was seen as either saving or dooming the industry; and an anti-horror discourse that framed the genre as dangerous and requiring censorship. My chapter tracks these discourses through publications important to middle-class British film culture (such as Sight & Sound, Screen International, and The Guardian) to show how they created an environment wherein the horror film could resurge and flourish.The three remaining chapters analyze how and to what end key films of the resurgence, including zombie films, hoodie horror, and Gothic horror, employ transnational genre hybridity to negotiate their relation to these discourses and position horror as a culturally legitimate genre within British national cinema. Focusing on the zombie films 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002) and Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004), chapter two traces the ways in which both films reframe the zombie of American director George Romero’s original Dead trilogy (1968, 1978, 1985) by drawing on popular British WWII-era cycles like nationalistic melodramas and Ealing comedies to evoke their associated cultural value. Through generic hybridity, these films situate themselves across nations, which allows them to comment upon the relationship between the American and British film industries.Chapter three examines Eden Lake (James Watkins, 2008) and Attack the Block (Joe Cornish, 2011), exploring how these films rework the tropes of American 1970s backwoods horror and cult action films via the contemporary British hoodie film cycle. The genre hybridity of these films thoroughly changes the American genres they draw from in order to participate in and critique the then-ongoing moral panic over working-class, racialized teens (commonly referred to as hoodies). Finally, chapter four looks at how Hammer Studios, whose celebrated horror films of the 1950s and 60s are synonymous with British horror, attempted to reclaim its cultural legitimacy domestically and abroad with The Woman in Black (James Watkins, 2012). The film hybridizes its British Gothic heritage with tropes of the contemporary Japanese Gothic, engaging with the Gothic as a global phenomenon that operates beyond the national."
eecs_etd_332,Transparent and Precise Malware Analysis Using Virtualization: From Theory to Practice,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Dynamic Analysis, Emulation, Malware Analysis, Taint Analysis, Virtualization","Dynamic analysis is an important technique used in malware analysis and is complementary to static analysis. Thus far, virtualization has been widely adopted for building fine-grained dynamic analysis tools and this trend is expected to continue. Unlike User/Kernel space malware analysis platforms that essentially co-exist with malware, virtualization based platforms benefit from isolation and fine-grained instrumentation support. Isolation makes it more difficult for malware samples to disrupt analysis and fine-grained instrumentation provides analysts with low level details, such as those at the machine instruction level. This in turn supports the development of advanced analysis tools such as dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution for automatic path exploration.The major disadvantage of virtualization based malware analysis is the loss of semantic information, also known as the semantic gap problem. To put it differently, since analysis takes place at the virtual machine monitor where only the raw system state (e.g., CPU and memory) is visible, higher level constructs such as processes and files must be reconstructed using the low level information. The collection of techniques used to bridge semantic gaps is known as Virtual Machine Introspection.Virtualization based analysis platforms can be further separated into emulation and hardware virtualization. Emulators have the advantages of flexibility of analysis tool development and efficiency for fine-grained analysis; however, emulators suffer from the transparency problem. That is, malware can employ methods to determine whether it is executing in an emulated environment versus real hardware and cease operations to disrupt analysis if the machine is emulated. In brief, emulation based dynamic analysis has advantages over User/Kernel space and hardware virtualization based techniques, but it suffers from semantic gap and transparency problems.These problems have been exacerbated by recent discoveries of anti-emulation malware that detects emulators and Android malware with two semantic gaps, Java and native. Also, it is foreseeable that malware authors will have a similar response to taint analysis. In other words, once taint analysis becomes widely used to understand how malware operates, the authors will create new malware that attacks the imprecisions in taint analysis implementations and induce false-positives and false-negatives in an effort to frustrate analysts.This dissertation addresses these problems by presenting concepts, methods and techniques that can be used to transparently and precisely analyze both desktop and mobile malware using virtualization. This is achieved in three parts. First, precise heterogeneous record and replay is presented as a means to help emulators benefit from the transparency characteristics of hardware virtualization. This technique is implemented in a tool called V2E that uses KVM for recording and TEMU for replaying and analysis. It was successfully used to analyze real-world anti-emulation malware that evaded analysis using TEMU alone. Second, the design of an emulation based Android malware analysis platform that uses virtual machine introspection to bridge both the Java and native level semantic gaps as well as seamlessly bind the two views together into a single view is presented. The core introspection and instrumentation techniques were implemented in a new analysis platform called DroidScope that is based on the Android emulator. It was successfully used to analyze two real-world Android malware samples that have cooperating Java and native level components. Taint analysis was also used to study their information ex-filtration behaviors. Third, formal methods for studying the sources of false-positives and false-negatives in dynamic taint analysis designs and for verifying the correctness of manually defined taint propagation rules are presented. These definitions and methods were successfully used to analyze and compare previously published taint analysis platforms in terms of false-positives and false-negatives."
etd_724,Trichloroacetimidates as Alkylating Reagents and Their Application in the Synthesis of Pyrroloindoline Natural Products and Synthesis of Small Molecule Inhibitors of Src Homology 2 Domain- Containing Inositol Phosphatase (SHIP),Chemistry,,"Trichloroacetimidates are known to be excellent alkylating agents when activated by a catalytic amount of a Brønsted or Lewis acid. Work described herein involved taking advantage of the favorable reactivity of trichloroacetimidates to establish several different synthetic protocols, including the application of these reagents in the synthesis of pyrroloindoline based natural products, 3,3'-disubstituted indolenines and benzylic trichloroacetamides.Initial investigations on the utilization of the reactivity of trichloroacetimidates found that diphenylmethyl trichloroacetimidate, which is a precursor to a highly stabilized carbocation, undergoes facile displacement with carboxylic acids providing the ester product without the need of any exogenous catalyst. Both hindered and unhindered carboxylic acids were esterified with high yields, with no preference for aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids with unprotected hydroxyl groups or ?-lactam rings were esterified efficiently. Substrates that are highly prone to elimination or retro-aldol were also esterified in high yields. Carboxylic acids with highly enolizable ?-stereocenters were esterified without any racemization. Mechanistic studies indicate that the carboxylic acid substrate itself is acidic enough to be effective at promoting the esterification reaction.During our studies on esterification with imidates it was found that these imidates also showed a tendency to undergo rearrangement to the corresponding trichloroacetamides. Two different sets of conditions, thermal and Lewis acid catalyzed, were established which provided these rearranged products with high yields. Various benzylic trichloroacetimidates were shown to undergo these transformations under the established conditions. Based on the observations discussed in this work a cationic mechanism is proposed.After the preliminary studies on alkylation of benzylic trichloroacetimidate with different nucleophiles, this chemistry was applied towards the synthesis of natural products and their analogs. The pyrroloindoline ring system is found in many alkaloids and cyclic peptides which mainly differ in the substitution at the C3a position. To provide rapid access to these natural products a diversity-oriented strategy was established via displacement of C3a-trichloroacetimidate pyrroloindoline. Carbon, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen nucleophiles were all shown to undergo substitution reactions with these trichloroacetimidates in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. In order to demonstrate the utility of this new method it was applied towards the synthesis of arundinine and a formal synthesis of psychotriasine. Current investigations involve the application of this method towards the synthesis of a complex pyrroloindoline natural product kapakahine C and the progress made therein has been discussed.The reactivity of trichloroacetimidates was also investigated for the selective C3-alkylation of 2,3-disubstituted indoles to provide indolenines. Indolenines serve as useful intermediates in the synthesis of many complex alkaloids. Different benzylic and allylic trichloroacetimidates were shown to provide 3,3’-disubstituted indolenines with high yields in the presence of catalytic amounts of Lewis acids. Various substituted indoles were evaluated under these reaction conditions. This methodology was also applied towards the synthesis of the core tetracyclic ring system found in communesin natural products.In addition to the above work, synthesis of small molecule inhibitors of Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing Inositol Phosphatase (SHIP) has also been described. Aberrations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cellular signaling pathway can lead to diseased cellular states like cancer. Herein we have reported stereoselective synthesis of two quinoline based small molecule SHIP inhibitors. The lead compounds and their analogs were tested for their activities against SHIP by Malachite green assay and the discoveries made therein are discussed. In addition to this synthesis of a tryptamine based SHIP inhibitor has also been reported."

Trichloroacetimidates have also been used as electrophiles in Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions. The formation of C-N bonds has also been accomplished utilizing trichloroacetimidates. Most frequently C-N bond formation with trichloroacetimidates is associated with sigmatropic rearrangement of an allylic trichloroacetimidate to an allylic trichloroacetamide. This reaction can proceed thermally or through the use of Lewis acid or transition metal catalysts. Recently, the direct substitution of trichloroacetimidates using nitrogen nucleophiles has been accomplished utilizing transition metal catalysts, which indicates that trichloroacetimidates may be suitable alkylation partners for certain nitrogen nucleophiles.Trichloroacetimidates are now shown to be effective alkylating reagents for the monosubstitution of anilines using the Brønsted acid catalyst (±)-camphorsulfonic acid. The reaction is especially efficient for electron deficient anilines while electron rich anilines provided lower yields due to competing Friedel-Crafts reactions. A one-pot procedure for generating the trichloroacetimidate in situ followed by displacement with the aniline is also described, and the yields for this one-step process are similar to the two-step protocol. The displacement of a chiralimidate by 4-chloroaniline led to significant racemization which indicates that the reaction may proceed through a carbocation intermediate.The alkylation of sulfonamides with trichloroacetimidates under thermal conditions is also described. Primary and secondary trichloroacetimidates are found to be suitable electrophiles under these conditions, while tertiary trichloroacetimidates provide reduced yields. Aryl and alkyl sulfonamides with varying electronic properties were well tolerated under the reaction conditions. A bioactive analog of the analgesic ketoprofen is synthesized using the described methodology. Complete racemization of a chiral trichloroacetimidate is observed under these reaction conditions which is evidence that the reaction proceeds through an SN1 type mechanism.Pyrroloindoline trichloroacetimidates may react with amine nucleophiles in the presence of catalytic BF3?OEt2 to generate pyrroloindoline systems decorated with amines at the C3a position. The natural product kapakahine C is a complex heterocyclic compound containing a substituted pyrroloindoline-pyridoindoline core that may be accessed using this method. A route to the synthesis of the substituted pyridoindoline core of kapakahine C was investigated. Optimization of key reactions in this sequence, including a peptide coupling reaction and oxidative cyclization, was performed. Investigation into completing the synthesis of kapakahine C is ongoing.The inhibition of the SH2-containing inositol 5’-phosphatase (SHIP) can modulate the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositols. These molecules act as second messengers in a signal transduction cascade, with the placement of phosphorylation on the inositol acting to convey information in the transmission of signals from the cell membrane to the cell nucleus. Theconcentration of these phosphates has an effect on cellular function such as cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.The synthesis of six aminosteroid SHIP inhibitors is described. Optimization of the key steps in the synthetic sequence was conducted. The synthesis of two quinoline based SHIP inhibitors, which were identified in a high-throughput screening conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), was also completed. Studies were conducted to synthesize these molecules on multi-gram scale. The synthesized compounds were tested for inhibitory activity in a Malachite Green assay."

Establishing these schools for students with intellectual and physical disabilities, excluded from attending formal schools based on the misconception that they were ""uneducable"".  In this project, I seek to understand how parent advocates, allies, teachers, women organizers, women with disabilities, and former students of these schools understood disability, illness, inclusive education, and community organizing.  Through interviews and analysis of archival documents, stories, cultural myths, legends related to people with disabilities, pamphlets, and newspaper media, I examine how disability advocates and people with disabilities interact with educational and cultural discourses to shape programs for the empowerment of people with disabilities.  I argue that the notions of ma’i (sickness), activism, and disability inform the Samoan context, and by understanding, their influence on human rights and educational policies can inform our biased attitudes on ableism and normalcy."

In order to take advantage of these properties, the surface chemistry of the qdots must first be changed in order to facilitate transfer out of organic solvents and into aqueous buffers. In my dissertation research, I developed a qdot phase transfer method using the amino acid histidine that quickly render qdots soluble in aqueous buffers, retains quantum yield (QY), allows for subsequent ligand exchange to tailor qdot surface chemistry, and is easily functionalized by biomaterials. A polymer wrapping method using poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) functionalized with N?'N?-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine (NTA) has also been developed. I also expressed and purified a red fluorescent protein (tagRFP) with a N-terminal hexa-histidine tag. TagRPF was utilized for initial fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies (FRET) with both histidine and polymer wrapped qdots as well as sequential bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-FRET using firefly luciferase as an energy donor, qdots or qrods as an intermediate acceptor/donor, and tagRFP as the final energy acceptor.The second focus of my dissertation research was the development of an expression system for human haptocorrin (HC). This process is an important part of the complex vitamin B12 (B12) uptake pathway, specifically as it provides protection for B12 from the mouth through the stomach, and into the intestine where is degraded. At the beginning of this work, there was no recombinant expression system for HC and its study was limited to purification from saliva and serum. I have cloned, expressed, and purified HC in the methylotropic yeast P. pastoris, and Human Embryonic Kidney Cells, as well as using it to target the asialoglycoprotein receptor for cellular imaging studies."

A Medical Ethnography,Social Sciences,"Birth, Childbirth, Epidural, History of Childbirth, Medical Ethnography, Nurse-Midwifery","This dissertation is a medical ethnography of a nurse-midwifery hospital-based maternity service in an urban American hospital.  The research study incorporates on-site observation, interviews, and data collection. The recent transformation of American hospital childbirth is described.  Epiduralized birth has become the norm, representing a standardization of the cascade of interventions so often referred to by critics of the system of hospital birth in the United States. The routine use of the epidural has led to a Gleichschaltung of birth where the centrality of the epidural makes necessary a unitary, complex, totalistic set of interventions all of which make up an entirety of interventions that cannot be separated from each other. The policy implications for this fundamental change in American birth are discussed. The history of childbirth and midwifery in the United States is also discussed as well as the culture of the profession of nurse-midwifery. The scientific literature regarding the physiology and ecology of birth, as well as the safety of medications used in epiduralized birth (particularly bupivacaine and pitocin) is analyzed.  Finally, the closure of the maternity service observed throughout this ethnographic research is discussed in light of regionalization and centralization of childbirth."

etd_754,TWO-DIMENSIONAL FLUIDIZATION OF NANOMATERIALS VIA BIOMIMETIC MEMBRANES TOWARDS ASSISTED SELF-ASSEMBLY,Physics,"Electroosmotic Flow, Nanomaterials, Self Assembly, Supported Lipid Bilayers","Materials that take advantage of the exceptional properties of nano-meter sized aggregates of atoms are poised to play an important role in future technologies. Prime examples for such nano-materials that have an extremely large surface to volume ratio and thus are physically determined by surface related effects are quantum dots (qdots) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The production of such manmade nano-objects has by now become routine and even commercialized. However, the controlled assembly of individual nano-sized building blocks into larger structures of higher geometric and functional complexity has proven to be much more challenging. Yet, this is exactly what is required for many applications that have transformative potential for new technologies. If the tedious procedure to sequentially position individual nano-objects is to be forgone, the assembly of such objects into larger structures needs to be implicitly encoded and many ways to bestow such self-assembly abilities onto nano objects are being developed. Yet, as overall size and complexity of such self-assembled structures increases, kinetic and geometric frustration begin to prevent the system to achieve the desired configuration. In nature, this problem is solved by relying on guided or forced variants of the self-assembly approach.  To translate such concepts into the realm of man-made nano-technology, ways to dynamically manipulate nano-materials need to be devised.Thus, in the first part of this work, I provide a proof of concept that supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) that exhibit free lateral diffusion of their constituents can be utilized as a two-dimensional platform for active nano-material manipulation. We used streptavidin coated quantum dots (Q-dots) as a model nano-building-block. Q-dots are 0-dimensional nanomaterials engineered to be fluorescent based solely on their diameter making visualization convenient.  Biotinylated lipids were used to tether Q-dots to a SLB and we observed that the 2-dimensional fluidity of the bilayer was translated to the quantum dots as they freely diffused. The quantum dots were visualized using wide-field fluorescent microscopy and single particle tracking techniques were employed to analyze their dynamic behavior. Next, an electric field was applied to the system to induce electroosmotic flow (EOF) which creates a bulk flow of the buffer solution. The quantum dots were again tracked and ballistic motion was observed in the particle tracks due to the electroosmosis in the system. This proved that SLBs could be used as a two-dimensional fluid platform for nanomaterials and electroosmosis can be used to manipulate the motion of the Q-dots once they are tethered to the membrane.Next, we set out to employ the same technique to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are known for their highly versatile mechanical and electrical properties. However, carbon nanotubes are extremely hydrophobic and tend to aggregate in aqueous solutions which negatively impacts the viability of tethering the CNTs to the bilayer, fluorescently staining and then imaging them. First, we had to solubilize the CNTs such that they were monodisperse and characterize the CNT-detergent solutions. We were able to create monodisperse solutions of CNTs such that the detergent levels were low enough that the integrity of the bilayer was intact. We were also able to fluorescently label the CNTs in order to visualize them, and tether them to a SLB using a peptide sequence. Future directions of this project would include employing EOF to mobilize the CNTs and use a more sophisticated single particle tracking software to track individual CNTs and analyze their motion."
etd_227,Uncertainty-Integrated Surrogate Modeling for Complex System Optimization,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Mathematical modeling, Model Management, Model Selection, Optimization, Surrogate Modeling, Uncertainty Quantification","Approximation models such as surrogate models provide a tractable substitute to expensive physical simulations and an effective solution to the potential lack of quantitative models of system behavior. These capabilities not only enable the efficient design of complex systems, but is also essential for the effective analysis of physical phenomena/characteristics in the different domains of Engineering, Material Science, Biomedical Science, and various other disciplines. Since these models provide an abstraction of the real system behavior (often a low-fidelity representative) it is important to quantify the accuracy and the reliability of such approximation models without investing additional expensive system evaluations (simulations or physical experiments). Standard error measures, such as the mean squared error, the cross-validation error, and the Akaike's information criterion however provide limited (often inadequate) information regarding the accuracy of the final surrogate model while other more effective dedicated error measures are tailored towards only one class of surrogate models. This lack of accuracy information and the ability to compare and test diverse surrogate models reduce the confidence in model application, restricts appropriate model selection, and undermines the effectiveness of surrogate-based optimization.A key contribution of this dissertation is the development of a new model-independent approach to quantify the fidelity of a trained surrogate model in a given region of the design domain. This method is called the Predictive Estimation of Model Fidelity (PEMF). The PEMF method is derived from the hypothesis that ""the accuracy of an approximation model is related to the amount of data resources leveraged to train the model"". In PEMF, intermediate surrogate models are iteratively constructed over heuristic subsets of sample points. The median and the maximum errors estimated over the remaining points are used to determine the respective error distributions at each iteration. The estimated modes of the error distributions are represented as functions of the density of intermediate training points through nonlinear regression, assuming a smooth decreasing trend of errors with increasing sample density. These regression functions are then used to predict the expected median and maximum errors in the final surrogate models. It is observed that the model fidelities estimated by PEMF are up to two orders of magnitude more accurate and statistically more stable compared to those based on the popularly-used leave-one-out cross-validation method, when applied to a variety of benchmark problems.By leveraging this new paradigm in quantifying the fidelity of surrogate models, a novel automated surrogate model selection framework is also developed. This PEMF-based model selection framework is called the Concurrent Surrogate Model Selection (COSMOS). COSMOS, unlike existing model selection methods, coherently operates at all the three levels necessary to facilitate optimal selection, i.e., (1) selecting the model type, (2) selecting the kernel function type, and (3) determining the optimal values of the typically user-prescribed parameters. The selection criteria that guide optimal model selection are determined by PEMF and the search process is performed using a MINLP solver. The effectiveness of COSMOS is demonstrated by successfully applying it to different benchmark and practical engineering problems, where it offers a first-of-its-kind globally competitive model selection.In this dissertation, the knowledge about the accuracy of a surrogate estimated using PEMF is applied to also develop a novel model management approach for engineering optimization. This approach adaptively selects computational models (both physics-based models and surrogate models) of differing levels of fidelity and computational cost, to be used during optimization, with the overall objective to yield optimal designs with high-fidelity function estimates at a reasonable computational expense. In this technique, a new adaptive model switching (AMS) metric defined to guide the switching of model from one to the next higher fidelity model during the optimization process. The switching criterion is based on whether the uncertainty associated with the current model output dominates the latest improvement of the relative fitness function, where both the model output uncertainty and the function improvement (across the population) are expressed as probability distributions. This adaptive model switching technique is applied to two practical problems through Particle Swarm Optimization to successfully illustrate: (i) the computational advantage of this method over purely high-fidelity model-based optimization, and (ii) the accuracy advantage of this method over purely low-fidelity model-based optimization.Motivated by the unique capabilities of the model switching concept, a new model refinement approach is also developed in this dissertation. The model refinement approach can be perceived as an adaptive sequential sampling approach applied in surrogate-based optimization. Decisions regarding when to perform additional system evaluations to refine the model is guided by the same model-uncertainty principles as in the adaptive model switching technique. The effectiveness of this new model refinement technique is illustrated through application to practical surrogate-based optimization in the area of energy sustainability."

Such program integrations, on one hand, connect every party in the Android ecosystem tightly on one single device. On the other hand, they can also pose severe security problems, if the security design of the underlying integration schemes is not well thought-out. This dissertation systematically evaluates the security design of three integration schemes on Android, including framework module, framework proxy and 3rd-party code embedding. With the security risks identified in each scheme, it concludes that program integrations on Android are unsafe. Furthermore, new frameworks have been designed and implemented to detect and mitigate the threats. The evaluation results on the prototypes have demonstrated their effectiveness."
etd_592,Understanding and Improving Security of the Android Operating System,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"android, security, virtualization","Successful realization of practical computer security improvements requires an understanding and insight into the system's security architecture, combined with a consideration of end-users' needs as well as the system's design tenets. In the case of Android, a system with an open, modular architecture that emphasizes usability and performance, acquiring this knowledge and insight can be particularly challenging for several reasons. In spite of Android's open source philosophy, the system is extremely large and complex, documentation and reference materials are scarce, and the code base is rapidly evolving with new features and fixes. To make matters worse, the vast majority of Android devices in use do not run the open source code, but rather proprietary versions that have been heavily customized by vendors for product differentiation.Proposing security improvements or making customizations without sufficient insight into the system typically leads to less-practical, less-efficient, or even vulnerable results. Point solutions to specific problems risk leaving other similar problems in the distributed security architecture unsolved. Far-reaching general-purpose approaches may further complicate an already complex system, and force end-users to endure significant performance and usability degradations regardless of their specific security and privacy needs. In the case of vendor customization, uninformed changes can introduce access control inconsistencies and new vulnerabilities. Hence, the lack of methodologies and resources available for gaining insight about Android security is hindering the development of practical security solutions, sound vendor customizations, and end-user awareness of the proprietary devices they are using.Addressing this deficiency is the subject of this dissertation. New approaches for analyzing, evaluating and understanding Android access controls are introduced and used to create an interactive database for use by security researchers as well as system designers and end-user product evaluators. Case studies using the new techniques are described, with results uncovering problems in Android's multiuser framework and vendor-customized System Services. Finally, the new insights are used to develop and implement a novel virtualization-based security architecture that protects sensitive resources while preserving Android's open architecture and expected levels of performance and usability."

Not all matter is uni-form, and impurities or heterogeneities can be modeled by fixed random disor-der. Numerous complex networks also possess fixed disorder, leading to appli-cations in transportation systems [1], telecommunications [2], social networks[3, 4], and epidemic modeling [5], to name a few.Due to their random nature and power law critical behavior, disorderedsystems are difficult to study analytically. Numerical simulation can helpovercome this hurdle by allowing for the rapid computation of system states.In order to get precise statistics and extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit,large systems must be studied over many realizations. Thus, innovative al-gorithm development is essential in order reduce memory or running timerequirements of simulations.This thesis presents a review of disordered systems, as well as a thoroughstudy of two particular systems through numerical simulation, algorithm de-velopment and optimization, and careful statistical analysis of scaling proper-ties.Chapter 1 provides a thorough overview of disordered systems, the his-tory of their study in the physics community, and the development of tech-niques used to study them. Topics of quenched disorder, phase transitions, therenormalization group, criticality, and scale invariance are discussed. Severalprominent models of disordered systems are also explained. Lastly, analysistechniques used in studying disordered systems are covered.In Chapter 2, minimal spanning trees on critical percolation clusters arestudied, motivated in part by an analytic perturbation expansion by Jacksonand Read [6] that I check against numerical calculations. This system has adirect mapping to the ground state of the strongly disordered spin glass [7].We compute the path length fractal dimension of these trees in dimensionsd = {2, 3, 4, 5} and find our results to be compatible with the analytic resultssuggested by Jackson and Read.In Chapter 3, the random bond Ising ferromagnet is studied, which is es-pecially useful since it serves as a prototype for more complicated disorderedsystems such as the random field Ising model and spin glasses. We investigatethe effect that changing boundary spins has on the locations of domain wallsin the interior of the random ferromagnet system. We provide an analyticproof that ground state domain walls in the two dimensional system are de-composable, and we map these domain walls to a shortest paths problem. Byimplementing a multiple-source shortest paths algorithm developed by PhilipKlein [8], we are able to efficiently probe domain wall locations for all possibleconfigurations of boundary spins. We consider lattices with uncorrelated dis-order, as well as disorder that is spatially correlated according to a power law.We present numerical results for the scaling exponent governing the probabil-ity that a domain wall can be induced that passes through a particular locationin the system’s interior, and we compare these results to previous results onthe directed polymer problem."
etd_670,UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION USE IN ONLINE CONSUMER-HEALTH SUPPORT GROUPS: A LOOK INTO INTERACTIVE HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS,Social Sciences,,"UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION USE IN ONLINE CONSUMER HEALTH SUPPORT GROUPS: A LOOK INTO INTERACTIVE HEALTH COMMUNICATIONSThe exponential growth of the Internet in the past two decades has been accompanied by an increased interest by Internet users in communicating among each other electronically about all sorts of topics, including health-related issues. This increased interest in peer-to-peer communication for health topics raised lots of questions about the potential harmful effects of these communications on those participants who might take some health-related action without consulting with a doctor first. This potential problem has motivated the researcher to investigate how people with certain health conditions use health information that they obtain from online support groups.Even though the understanding of how information is sought, retrieved, and ultimately used is a very important topic within information behavior research, information use is an area that has seen less study. For this reason, the researcher decided to investigate information use within online consumer health support groups using a content analytical approach. The study had two specific objectives: (a) to describe what some of the cognitive, affective, and behavioral actions that consumers indicate they had taken based on information shared within some of the online support groups to which they belong; and (b) to determine if the uses given to information follow any pattern among different chronic conditions being studied with relation to the type of questions asked, the type of reply messages, and the health-related content of the messages.Methodologically, the study used computer-mediated discourse analysis to guide collection of trace data that came from archives of selected online discussion boards related to the three chronic conditions chosen for the study. For data to be part of the study, the presence of interactions with indications of usefulness was necessary. Then, through content analysis, the data was coded using several classification schemas found in the literature, some of them in their original form, others adapted to fit this research purpose. These schemas looked into the types of questions asked, the functions of the reply messages, the type of medical content of the posted messages, and the type of use given to the information. Once all the data was processed, the researcher looked for patterns among the different variables and across the different gender-based chronic conditions.Results of the analysis show that the message characteristics of content type, function of reply messages, and question types, have a significant relationship with the types of conditions. Message characteristics also show a significant relationship with the cognitive, affective, and behavioral information uses. Discussions of the results as well as some alternatives for future research are presented.Enter Abstract here later"
etd_686,Understanding integrated STEM science instruction through the experiences of teachers and students,Teaching and Leadership,"education, integrated, phenomenology, secondary, STEM","Integrated STEM education comprises an exploration of the interconnections between science, technology, engineering and mathematics in order to reflect on how each discipline operates within real world contexts. Students benefit from the integrated STEM approach because it values students’ real-life experiences and hands-on applications that mirror professional STEM work. However, Integrated STEM instruction remains ill defined, with many gaps in the existing research. The school setting central to this study was a suburban public middle school with a nationally recognized integrated STEM program. Through the use of hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry, I focused on both teachers’ and students’ experiences of participation in one integrated STEM model. I analyzed data using thematic moment clusters and event mapping to look at patterns of experiences across time. I found that participation in this integrated STEM model included six common experiences: (1) project-based learning, (2) flexible instructional time, (3) consistent co-teaching with two or more teachers, (4) social skills development, (5) extensive use of computer-based technology, and (6) the use of school spaces beyond the classroom for instruction purposes. The students viewed their involvement in the integrated STEM model positively and many noted an interest in pursuing a STEM-related career in the future. The teachers reported an enhancement of their professional repertoire through consistent planning, co-teaching and observational practices. After five years of enactment, challenges that persisted for this integrated STEM team included pressures to adhere to state and district demands, as well as the need for non-traditional spaces to engage students in creative ways. This model provides further evidence of the need to reorganize school content, space, and time."
etd_665,Understanding Mediators of the Relationship Between HIV-Related Stigma and Medication Adherence Among People Living with HIV (HIV),Psychology,"antiretroviral therapy, HIV, medication adherence, stigma","Although accumulated research demonstrates that HIV-related stigma is associated with medication adherence difficulties for PLWH, this literature is limited by inconsistencies in the conceptualization and assessment of both stigma and adherence. Additionally, few empirical research studies provide tests of the psychosocial mechanisms that may account for the stigma-adherence relationship. The present study sought to clarify these relationships using more refined measures, which assessed multiple domains of stigma (i.e., internalized, anticipated, and enacted stigmas) and multiple domains of adherence (i.e., global and intentional nonadherence). It was further hypothesized that two mediational pathways, depressive symptoms and disclosure concerns, may mediate the association between HIV-related stigmas and adherence. A clinic-based sample of 205 people living with HIV (PLWH) completed a questionnaire battery using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Contrary to previous research, there was no association between HIV-related stigmas and adherence. There was also no evidence that disclosure concerns acted as a mediational pathway, but there was evidence that depression mediated the association between internalized and enacted stigmas and intentional nonadherence since diagnosis. This lack of an association between stigma and adherence may be attributable to a different stage of the HIV epidemic, in which simplified medication regimens present fewer obstacles for PLWH. Future research should prospectively explore the interrelationships among HIV-related stigmas, mediators, and adherence outcomes in the current era of the HIV epidemic and with differing populations."
etd_493,UNDERSTANDING SOFT MOLECULAR INTERFACES USING MULTISCALE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,,"Molecular dynamics simulations have proven to be a breakthrough approach in providing molecular structure and function details of biological macromolecules. The fact that molecular simulations can provide details of individual particle motions as a function of time, opens infinite possibilities of answering specific questions about a model system with atomistic and molecular precision, often more easily than experiments on the actual system. Instead of relying solely on experiments, molecular dynamics systems are based on empirical force fields that mimic molecular interactions over time. There has been increasing interest in utilizing the multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) approach to simulate the properties of biological macromolecules for meaningful applications in areas of nanotoxicity, nanotherapy, and nanomedicine.Recent advances in nanomedicine have led to the great development of several drug-delivery platforms for targeted delivery. Polymeric drug delivery systems are designed and applied to ameliorate undesirable properties of the drug agents such as hydrophobicity, poor targeting ability, and broad scale toxicity. However, rational structural design of polymeric nanocarrier is only based on theoretical investigation, that restraint by absence of real molecular-level details. So, MD approach is used to provide those desirable details which not feasible in experiments. In our work, models of three generations of anticancer nanocarriers polymer were developed and characterized using multiscale MD simulations. The results were compared to in vitro experimental results. Observations were analyzed and found to be in good agreement with experiments results on size and morphology changes. Details shown by our systems helped us discover the reasons for the different nanocarriers’ performances. Our results show the in silico methods that can be used to contribute to drug nanocarrier design optimization work.Claudins, are critical components in building tight junctions (TJs) which could form paracellular channels or barriers for physiological functions. Recently, 27 types of claudins have been classified based on different functions and characteristics, and they are becoming potential points in developing drug delivery systems and pathological studies. However, the architecture of claudin strand in TJs is still unclear thus impeding further study and applications. So, we use MD simulation approach to replicate self-assembly process and try to find out the potential construction models. In our work, claudin-1, -2, -5, and -15 monomer models were built by homology modeling and validated. Self-assembly processes of non-mutated and mutated claudins were conducted to reproduce the construction of claudin macromolecular strands. Four classified dimer models predicted by existing research were found to be reproduced in our molecular dynamics systems, and their number distributions were calculated. Our results first time showed the potential models for TJ architectures that can be a guidance for understanding TJs."

The phenomenon of interest in this dissertation is understanding how the educational experiences of students are affected when social media are incorporated into online and blended course activities. Qualitative case studies are undertaken toward this end from a Human-Computer Interaction perspective by proposing 4 research questions: (1) How does the use of social media in blended-learning courses impact students' educational experience? (2) How does the use of social media in online courses impact students' educational experience? (3) How do specific features of social media impact student experiences inside the physical classroom? (4) How do specific features of social media impact student experiences outside of the physical classroom?This work is rooted in the theoretical foundations of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework to conceptualize educational experience as defined by the intersection of social, cognitive, and teaching presences. Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) is also integrated here to conceptualize social media features as technical objects defined through the relationship of functional affordances and symbolic expressions between students and social media.The findings are based on a total of 9 case studies (5 within a blended context and 4 within an online context) bound by students in Masters-level library science classes at Syracuse University. The results suggest that social presence is clearly the most salient type of presence in social media within blended course contexts, while cognitive and social presences are relatively salient in social media within online course contexts. Two main categories of affordances, timeliness and information curation, emerged as pertinent to students' educational experiences in blended courses; while both of these, plus multimedia engagement, were identified as relevant to online courses. Technical objects (general features of social media) were identified which facilitate these affordances, and implications based on these are provided in respect to practice (for educators and information technology designers) and theory."
etd_181,UNINTENDED EFFECTS OF CHARTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS,Public Administration,"Charter Schools, Cost Function, Housing Values, Location Decision, School Choice, Unintended Effects","The dissertation is comprised of three essays, which study unintended effects of charter school programs. Chapter 1 evaluates the influence of charter schools on housing values. The dynamics between school quality and housing markets contribute to the isolation of disadvantaged students in low performing school districts. Charter schools reduce the link between residential location and school services, and hence potentially affect both property values and residential sorting. This chapter examines if charter schools influence the differences in housing prices between school districts and neighborhoods. I begin by developing a theoretical model identifying how charter schools influence school quality and how these changes potentially affect housing prices. Utilizing housing sale data for Upstate New York between 2000 and 2010, I estimate models comparing changes in housing price differences between school districts and neighborhoods. I find that charter schools do not influence the gap in housing prices between districts but affect the differences in housing values between high and low income neighborhoods in districts with charter schools.Chapter 2 analyzes the location of charter schools in New York, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, and Ohio. I begin by describing the finance, accountability, and authorizer policies in each state. Then, I derive location and enrollment incentives created by these policies. Estimated negative binomial models reveal consistency between location patterns and finance provisions. In states where charter school payments vary with district location, charter schools are more likely to locate in districts with high expenditures holding cost and performance constant. However, in states where charter school payments do not vary with district location, charter school location is not influenced by district expenditures. Compensations for enrolling disadvantaged students create location and enrollment incentives if they are sufficient enough to cover the costs of educating these students.Chapter 3 examines how charter schools influence school district efficiency. Charter school opponents and proponents have been arguing for a long time about the effect of charter schools on district efficiency with very opposing views on the subject. Utilizing data for all New York State school districts from 1998 to 2009, I find that charter schools increase school district efficiency holding cost factors and district performance constant. The magnitude of the effect differs depending on the number of students enrolled in charter schools. The effect ranges between a 1.1 and 3.4 percent decrease in per pupil expenditures for enrollments between 50 and 5000 charter school students respectively. The effect is driven by efficiency gains in the provision of education for students in traditional public schools. The results are confirmed by several falsification tests."
etd_477,University Administrator Interactions: Balancing Politeness and Authority,Communication and Rhetorical Studies,,"Higher education professionals regularly interact with university community members such as students, faculty, and staff. These interactions may take place one-on-one in private, or in large groups in public contexts on college campuses. This thesis uses discourse analysis to explore a town-hall meeting and a student protest at a university to demonstrate how university administrator interactions reflect efforts to maintain politeness and negotiate authority. I consider how administrators present positive politeness and friendliness while also seeking to uphold and assert their institutional roles. University community members similarly seek to preserve positive social relationships through politeness. However, in the absence of institutional authority, students, staff, and faculty use discursive tools to ground their own authority and perspectives, and sometimes outwardly challenge institutional authority. Findings suggest that politeness is demonstrated in university administrator interactions through the use of thank you, the issuing of compliments, as well as the use of apologies to mitigate impoliteness. University discourse shows how community members use evidence such as membership categories, functioning as a representative, as well as intertextuality and time to ground their right to be heard. These observations reflect the identities and images that university administrators and their constituents present in public interactions."
tl_etd_241,Unlocking Students' Perspectives of Leadership,Teaching and Leadership,Educational leadership,"The need for principals to have the time and tools to focus on instruction and student learning has continued to intensify. At the same time, the incongruence between what principals want to do instructionally and have time to do, creates dire consequences for school leaders and their work in making a difference in schools regarding staff and student improvement.This study examines whether and how principals take their lead from students, and use student voice, to create more responsive schools, and more responsible models of leadership. In order to describe and explain whether and how principals have used students' perspectives to meaningfully structure their experiences of school and learning, I explore how students can naturally inform the work being done by principals in order to bring students' attitudes and feelings about school, learning and leadership into the dominant discourse on effective administrative practice.I consider issues of student agency and voice within four very different elementary school settings. Further, I consider the challenges students face, and the ways principals are preparing to address these challenges. In this study I address roadblocks to responsive leadership in urban, suburban, and rural schools using a cogenerative qualitative approach that principals and students can use to create new dialogue and shared theories that are focused on improving both administrative function and the instructional programs of their schools. This approach has revealed a new shared theory which includes students in models of school leadership. Central to this theory is a call for principals to use more student-driven approaches to guiding their principalship, so that students can be empowered as learners and school leaders in their own right."
etd_144,Unpacking Coalitions: Explaining International Commitment in European Governments,Political Science,"Clarity of Responsibility, Coalitions, Commitment, Europe, Foreign Policy Analysis, Veto Players","A central debate in the Comparative Foreign Policy literature concerns the role of government composition on the international behavior of parliamentary democracies. For the past two decades, a multitude of studies have discussed whether single-party governments were more or less constrained than multiparty coalitions in their international behavior, yet they have failed to reach conclusive empirical findings. This dissertation responds to this puzzle by unpacking coalitions: as it captures the variation among coalition governments along mathematical and ideological dimensions, the dissertation introduces a nuanced 'government composition' approach to explain the international commitments of European parliamentary regimes during the post-Cold War period.To undertake this project, the dissertation utilizes the Comparative Politics literature on coalition theories, legislative politics and economic voting. Specifically, it introduces the veto players and clarity of government responsibility theories to frame the debate and to demonstrate that both theories remain inadequate in explaining commitment intensity unless two key variables are accounted for: (a) the types of multiparty governments that emerge in parliamentary systems and (b) the extent of ideological differences inside these coalitions, or their 'policy incongruence.' Furthermore, the dissertation challenges the existing understanding regarding the constrained nature of minority coalitions by bringing in the policy viability and fragmented opposition explanations into the analysis of foreign policy behavior.The dissertation employs a multi-method research strategy to comprehensively evaluate the analytical capacity of the 'government composition' explanation by (a) revealing the statistical relationships between government composition and international commitments, (b) uncovering the mechanisms that link the composition of governments to international commitments, and (c) testing the explanatory power of the 'government composition' approach against a series of alternative explanations at the individual, domestic and international levels.To these ends, the dissertation first utilizes a post-Cold War foreign policy events dataset to test the effects of government type and ideological cohesion by using multilevel regression techniques. Next, it complements these analyses with structured-focused case studies of the Danish decisions to join the 1990 Gulf and 2003 Iraq wars and the Dutch decision to support the 2003 Iraq war. The case studies evaluate a series of alternative explanations including public opinion, logrolling dynamics among political parties, threats to national survival and the role of political leadership as well as the domestic and international political contexts of these states to explain how they have decided to provide political and material support for these international military operations.The project firmly concludes that the dichotomous understanding of government composition that has long prevailed in the foreign policy literature is not only inadequate but misleading to explain the international commitments of parliamentary democracies. Quantitative and qualitative tests suggest that the type of multiparty governments and their ideological diversity together affect commitment intensity in different directions, through diverse mechanisms. Specifically, oversized coalitions engage in more intense commitments compared to single-party majority governments through responsibility diffusion. Minority coalitions engage in stronger commitments so long as their ideological setup leaves the parliamentary opposition fragmented, through policy viability. Finally, minimum winning coalitions can overcome their ideological fragility and increase their international commitments when the political parties engage in logrolling relationships with each other. The dissertation situates these findings within the context of factors that pertain to the motivations of key political leaders, domestic political norms and public opinion, as well as the broader historical foreign policy orientations of the states.With the conclusions of the statistical and case analyses, the dissertation ultimately offers a 'coalition politics framework' to explain foreign policy behavior in parliamentary regimes. In the end, the dissertation contributes to the literature on foreign policy analysis as the first study to introduce a multilevel, multicausal framework to evaluate the international behavior of parliamentary democracies."
etd_693,Using Affirmation Theory to Further Understand the Distinction between the Individual Self and the Collective Self,Psychology,"Bias, Group-Affirmation, Self-Affirmation","Research in social psychology points to a discontinuity between the individual self and the collective self such that operating at the collective level of identity leads one to be more biased, defensive, and hostile than when operating at the individual level of identity. One area of research where this distinction is particularly apparent is that of identity threat and affirmation theory. Although affirming the self has been shown to reduce individual-level biases in the face of threat, affirming the group in response to a collective-level threat has been shown to accentuate biased tendencies. This may be a result of the inherent inflexibility of the collective self. Unlike self-affirmation, group-affirmation may induce a focus on a specific social identity and activate the psychological attributes (e.g., attitudes, stereotypes, and norms) pertinent to that identity which then guide subsequent thoughts, judgments, motivations, and behaviors. This raises the question, if the collective self is construed in this manner, are there certain contexts in which affirming the group can in fact lead to a reduction in bias and defensiveness in the face of threat? Two potential contexts are addressed in this research: (a) if the threat is to one’s individual-level identity (Study 1) and (b) if having unbiased attitudes are a component of the affirmed group’s psychological identity (Study 2). Affirming the group did not affect participants’ attributional tendencies following a self-threatening task performance. Group-affirmation did, however, increase positive attitudes towards certain out-groups for low-identifying group members. Also, unlike affirming the self, affirming the group did not protect participants’ self-esteem from either an individual-level threat or a collective-level threat, providing further support for the notion that self- and group-affirmation are distinct processes. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."
ear_etd_27,Using Emerging Methods to Investigate Stream and Groundwater Interaction at Multiple Spatial Scales,Earth Sciences,"beaver, biogeochemistry, hyporheic, stream, surface water/groundwater, tracer","Fundamentally, streams represent physical conduits of water across gradients, yet a more holistic definition reveals stream corridors support a mosaic of living communities in a blend of surface and ground waters. The physical and biogeochemical patterns these dynamic systems support affect natural habitat and water quality, directly impacting the human experience. Our understanding of stream and groundwater interactions is at a time of rapid expansion due to an increase in environmental awareness, accountability, and emerging techniques which can be used to decipher underlying controls and develop predictive relationships. Water temperature has been used as a qualitative environmental tracer during the forging of this country from Lewis and Clarks pioneering spatial explorations to Thoreau's revolutionary scientific investigations; yet only very recent modeling and technological advancements have allowed us to apply these principles in a more distributed quantitative fashion. The resulting description of physical flow dynamics can be combined with innovative biogeochemical assessments to determine the fundamental linkages between inert and living processes along the stream corridor.The magnitude and spatial distribution of groundwater inflows to streams is a known control on stream water quality. These inflows can be recognized and evaluated through a variety of methods, each with its own sensitivity and basic requirements. One such method is using the temperature differential between surface and groundwaters to both locate and quantify groundwater inputs. The emerging method of fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) uses the temperature dependent backscatter of light along fiber-optic cables to determine temperature at high spatial and temporal resolution, essential creating continuous thermometers that may be applied to aquatic systems over a broad range of spatial scales. My initial investigations involved a quantitative comparison of heat tracing with DTS to existing methods of evaluating groundwater inflows (dye dilution gauging, differential gauging, and geochemical end-member mixing) along Nine Mile Creek in Syracuse, New York, USA. I found that DTS heat tracing generated comparable quantitative estimates of groundwater discharge to the stream, and provided the finest spatial characterization of these inflows of all methods tested.The ""hyporheic zone"" describes where stream water temporarily enters the sub-surface, which is known to be biogeochemically reactive, before potentially mixing with shallow groundwaters and returning to the stream. This flux across the streambed interface has driven much recent research, but the intrinsic spatial and temporal variability have proven a challenge to define. I modified DTS optical fibers to improve spatial resolution from 1.0 to 0.014 meter so the propagation of diurnal temperature patterns into the steambed could be recorded and applied to one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion models to determine the vertical component of hyporheic flux. I installed these custom high-resolution fiber-optic temperature sensors within the streambed above two beaver dams in Lander, Wyoming, USA for five weeks as stream discharge dropped by 45%. The resulting rich datasets revealed flux was organized by streambed morphology with strong, deep flux at glides and near-dam bars, and weak, shallow flux at pools and bars set farther upstream. Additionally, these morphologic units showed contrasting temporal trends in flux penetration and magnitude.One benefit of such refined descriptions of the physical hyporheic system is that they can be directly compared to ambient biogeochemical data collected in coincident vertical profiles to evaluate the physical controls on streambed chemistry and nutrient cycling. I collected pore water at multiple depths, once a week, and analyzed these samples for several conservative and redox-sensitive solutes. The results revealed strong correlation between vertical flux magnitude and the degree to which hyporheic water was ""oxic-stream-like"" or ""anoxic-reduced"". Residence time along hyporheic flowpaths was found to be a dominant control on redox condition, a relationship that held for both spatial and temporal flux patterns. This data set was augmented by an injection of the new biologically sensitive resazurin environmental tracer which showed that hyporheic flowpaths had much greater rates of aerobic reactivity compared to the net streamflow, but this signal was indistinguishable at the reach scale.The cumulative result of the past three years of stream research using emerging ideas and methods is an improved understanding of these intricate and fascinating biomes. I hope this knowledge will serve to improve the management of, and appreciation for, the veins of our shared landscape."
it_etd_87,Using Ontology-Based Approaches to Representing Speech Transcripts for Automated Speech Scoring,Information Science and Technology,"automatic speech scoring, content scoring of speech, natural language processing, ontology, ontology-based representation, text mining","Text representation is a process of transforming text into some formats that computer systems can use for subsequent information-related tasks such as text classification. Representing text faces two main challenges: meaningfulness of representation and unknown terms. Research has shown evidence that these challenges can be resolved by using the rich semantics in ontologies. This study aims to address these challenges by using ontology-based representation and unknown term reasoning approaches in the context of content scoring of speech, which is a less explored area compared to some common ones such as categorizing text corpus (e.g. 20 newsgroups and Reuters).From the perspective of language assessment, the increasing amount of language learners taking second language tests makes automatic scoring an attractive alternative to human scoring for delivering rapid and objective scores of written and spoken test responses. This study focuses on the speaking section of second language tests and investigates ontology-based approaches to speech scoring. Most previous automated speech scoring systems for spontaneous responses of test takers assess speech by primarily using acoustic features such as fluency and pronunciation, while text features are less involved and exploited. As content is an integral part of speech, the study is motivated by the lack of rich text features in speech scoring and is designed to examine the effects of different text features on scoring performance.A central question to the study is how speech transcript content can be represented in an appropriate means for speech scoring. Previously used approaches from essay and speech scoring systems include bag-of-words and latent semantic analysis representations, which are adopted as baselines in this study; the experimental approaches are ontology-based, which can help improving meaningfulness of representation units and estimating importance of unknown terms. Two general domain ontologies, WordNet and Wikipedia, are used respectively for ontology-based representations. In addition to comparison between representation approaches, the author analyzes which parameter option leads to the best performance within a particular representation.The experimental results show that on average, ontology-based representations slightly enhances speech scoring performance on all measurements when combined with the bag-of-words representation; reasoning of unknown terms can increase performance on one measurement (cos.w4) but decrease others. Due to the small data size, the significance test (t-test) shows that the enhancement of ontology-based representations is inconclusive.The contributions of the study include: 1) it examines the effects of different representation approaches on speech scoring tasks; 2) it enhances the understanding of the mechanisms of representation approaches and their parameter options via in-depth analysis; 3) the representation methodology and framework can be applied to other tasks such as automatic essay scoring."
etd_141,Using Temperature-Sensitive Smart Polymers to Regulate DNA-mediated Nanoassembly,Chemistry,,"Nanoparticle (NP) self-assembly has been proven as an effective route to organize nanoscale building blocks into ordered structures for potential technological applications. In order to successfully exploit the self-assembly processes a high level of direction and control is required. In my dissertation research, I synthesized a temperature responsive copolymer (p) to modify gold nanoparticles (AuNP) for controlling self-assembly. The copolymers' ability to regulate DNA-mediated NP self-assembly is a particular focus. In Chapter 2, the results show that by the addition of the p to create thermally responsive NP interfaces allows for controlled aggregation behavior and interparticle distances defined by the transition temperature (TC) of the p, to aid in NP assembly and help to regulate DNA-mediated interactions between NP. The work in Chapter 3 revealed that the reconfigurable conformation of the p sterically regulates the assembly: at T < TC, the chains extended beyond the hydrodynamic reach of the single stranded DNA and prohibited recognition, while at T > TC, assembly was observed, due the hydrophobic collapse of the p and the subsequent exposure of the complementary DNA bases. In Chapter 4, to gain insight into the mechanism, the rate of assembly was monitored, with DNA lengths that had hydrodynamic diameters more comparable to that of the p, and found the p was capable of slowing the kinetics. I further investigated to find that the addition of p extended the interparticle distances while disrupting the long range ordering. Finally, how the temperature responsive behavior of the p acted on the interparticle distances was probed, and it was found that without p, the interparticle distances expanded, while the addition of p compressed the interparticle distances."
it_etd_86,UTILIZATION AND VALUE OF PUBLIC SECTOR INFORMATION FOR KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF SOUTH AFRICA,Library and Information Science,"Developing World, Knowleodge for Development, Knowloedge Creation, PSI Utilization and Value, Public Sector Information (PSI), South Africa","Although there appears to be a broad recognition of the key role that Public Sector Information (PSI) can play in the development of societies, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how PSI is actually being utilized and of its wider societal value, especially in developing countries. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to analyze the PSI utilization process within the knowledge creation context and the factors and conditions that affect its value and usability from the user perspective. More specifically, the thesis investigates the PSI-related factors and conditions that facilitate or hinder the utilization process, as well as the PSI attributes that affect its usefulness and value in two organizations working on social and economic development issues in South Africa: the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The dissertation uses the information management process framework (Choo, 1995) and the information value-in-use framework (Repo, 1986) to guide the study's design, data collection, data analysis, and presentation of the results. Employing a qualitative approach, a single case study was used to gather data through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, and document review. The study demonstrates that in their attempts to find and acquire the PSI needed for their work, the study participants faced a wide range of technical, institutional, and political obstacles and challenges. The study also demonstrates that several of the assumptions in the literature about PSI-related policies and resources were not applicable to a developing country. Despite these access challenges and issues related to PSI quality, the utilized PSI resources were still instrumental to the knowledge creation processes at the study sites and to the overall socioeconomic development of the country. The study concludes that in addition to the progressive legislation on information access and use in South Africa, effective PSI utilization for knowledge creation and development requires defined and clear national standards and mechanisms to ensure that the policies and guidelines are adhered to, and that the bureaucratic restrictions on information access and use are minimal. It also requires the development of an organizational culture that is sensitive to the value of its information assets and the effective management of relations with users. It is hoped that this effort can help PSI holders in South Africa and elsewhere to create more enabling environments so that the value of these resources can be maximized"
etd_61,"Valuing Health: Herbal Traditions, Pharmaceuticals, and Healing in Bangladesh",Anthropology,"Bangladesh, Global Health, History of Medicine, Neoliberalism, Traditional Medicine","This dissertation examines the people and institutions involved in changing traditional medicine in Bangladesh. These transformations are connected to political, economic, and social negotiations of colonial pasts as well as new negotiations during the current era of neoliberal globalization. As the Bangladeshi state and its policies are transformed by neoliberal shifts, health care is increasingly decentralized and privatized, and citizens rely more on pharmaceuticals to treat and manage health.This commodification of health has a powerful role in changing the landscape of traditional medicine in Bangladesh, which includes the formal medical traditions of Unani and Ayurveda, but also new categories of herbal pharmaceuticals and indigenous self-treatment practices.Using a multi-sited ethnographic research method, I traced the circulation of traditional medicine in and through multiple sites in Bangladesh. This multi-sited method allowed me to bring policy makers, company owners, practitioners and patients into the same research frame. I used this approach to understand the relationships between these actors and their different stakes in traditional medicine. The links between medicine, the market, and culture determine the value of health and medicine in its many forms. The Bangladeshi government is promoting the herbal pharmaceutical industry and the growth of herbal plantations to develop a more economically self-sufficient nation. This work shows how the state gives greater value to traditional medicine once the traditional medical industry is seen as a potential generator of national income. I argue that the intended meaning and material outcome of different categories of traditional medicine affect who produces which medicines and ultimately whom they treat. I explore the politics involved in the creation of categories of medicine: what medical practices are included and excluded, and who makes these decisions.The industrial manufacture of traditional medicines has led to controversies about what is considered traditional medicine in Bangladesh, as traditional manufacturers compete with the surge of newly mass-produced herbal medicines in both local and global markets. Herbal pharmaceutical companies and traditional manufacturers have broadened their marketing strategies and often sell their medicines through medical representatives, allopathic doctors, or directly to patients. Meanwhile, schools, practitioners, and companies all struggle to legitimate traditional medical knowledge, whether in the name of science, naturalness, history and tradition, or as a way of healing. At the same time, I show how community health groups are reacting to the commercialization of health and the lack of access to government healthcare by organizing new forms of healing using indigenous knowledge of herbal plants or acupressure. In the process, these groups create their own conceptualizations of traditional medicine and the relationship between self-sufficiency, self-care, and health."

How do state leaders reconcile tensions between the competing war memories of victimization and aggression with the state's aspirations for international leadership? Analyzing archival documents, history textbooks, and leaders' speeches, I examine the content and contestation of Japan's collective memories of World War II and their effects on its three foreign policy cases: (1) UN diplomacy at the global level, (2) foreign aid policy toward Southeast Asia at the regional level, and (3) foreign policy regarding war responsibility and an apology for comfort women at the bilateral level with South Korea. I find that the boundaries of Japanese war memory, influenced by international hierarchy, have never been fixed, and vary over time. I argue that variations in the content and contestation of war memory, mediated by multiple relationships, define a range of legitimate foreign policy options. My findings suggest that the notions of international hierarchy and meanings help our understanding of the workings of power in international politics."
etd_516,Vir Bonus: Political Masculinity from the Republic to the Principate,History,"manliness, masculinity, Roman politics, vir bonus, virility","“Vir Bonus: Political Masculinity from the Republic to the Principate” argues that political participation was the bedrock of Roman masculinity. Traditional analyses that center on penetrative sexual protocol, personal rivalries, and military aggression overlook obligations of political life, where republican principles moderated more assertive qualities. In deliberations in the Senate, at social gatherings, and on military campaign, displays of consensus with other men informed social discourse and built elite comradery. I use literary sources and inscriptions that offer censorious or affirmative appraisal of male behavior from the Middle and Late Republic (ca. 300 – 31 BCE) to the Principate or Early Empire (31 BCE – ca. 100 CE), and assert that the vir bonus or “good man,” the Roman persona of male aristocratic excellence, modulated imperatives for personal distinction and military violence with political cooperation and moral exemplarity. While the advent of one-man rule in the Empire transformed actual political power, I argue that ideals forged in the Republic were adapted to the new climate and provided a coherent model of masculinity for emperor and senator alike. Scholars often paint a picture of Republic and Principate as distinct landscapes, but I show that enduring ideals of male self-fashioning constitute an important continuity.And yet, Rome remained a man’s world. Only some participated in politics and obtained auctoritas and gravitas, the prestigious cultural rewards for the vir bonus, who stood at the apex of society. Others – slaves, freedmen, foreigners, and women – were foreclosed access to these prizes, and thus to political power. I therefore further maintain that even a cooperative and necessarily moral masculinity which fostered bonds between men still furthered male authority."
etd_564,Visionary Architecture:  Monastic Magic and Cognition in John of Morigny’s Liber florum,Religion,,"In a text called the Liber florum celestis doctrine or Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching, the Benedictine monk John of Morigny, who was active in the first decades of the fourteenth century, presents a series of visions of divine and demonic forces, a lengthy series of prayers designed to elicit further visions (particularly visions of statues that come to life) and to grant knowledge of the seven liberal arts, and autobiographical details that recount his waking and visionary interactions with a condemned text, the Ars notoria and his own Liber florum.  Though, according to John, his own text was originally seen as licit, it was, in 1323, condemned in Paris as heresy and sorcery.  This contrast between initial acceptance and eventual condemnation sets up a dynamic that I argue is replicated repeatedly both in classifying the genre of the Liber florum and in the visionary events that John narrates.  John’s text and the visions of divine entities depicted within it, make a habit of straddling boundaries, the boundaries of licit and illicit, animation and stasis, divine presence and divine absence.  John’s text, in all its strangeness and evasions of category, needs significant contextualization (though even with a fully fleshed-out context, John and his text still don’t quite fit solidly in any one place).  It is towards the explanation of this context that the first chapters of this dissertation will most particularly work.  This contextualization will help shape an understanding of John that highlights both his alignment with traditional and accepted patterns of medieval monastic practice and theology as well as his deviations from those patterns.  In teasing out the ways in which John’s practice and the content of his visions maintain such paradoxical states, I closely examine how a monk like John would have thought and seen the world around him, reconstructing habits of cognition and understandings of perception that are often alien to our own.  Once, as far as is possible, this fourteenth century monastic perspective has been reconstructed, I move on to a discussion of the difficult materiality of the animated statues seen in John’s visions.  In reconstructing the intellectual, cognitive, and sensorial milieu of this one medieval monk, I provide a particularized resource for the study of the Liber florum, as well as, more broadly, a methodological model for the study of magic in the middle ages that emphasizes the need to tackle the tricky interior spaces of perception and cognition."
etd_222,Visualizing Words and Knowledge: Arts of Memory from the Agora to the Computer,Writing Program,,"This dissertation examines rhetoric's fourth canon--the art of memory--tracing its development through the classical, medieval, and early modern periods. It argues that for most of its history, the fourth canon was an art by which words and knowledge were remediated into visual, spatial forms, either in the mind or on the page. And it was this technique of visualization, I argue, that linked the canons of memory and invention throughout history.  In contemporary rhetorical theory, however, memory palaces and mnemonic imagery have been replaced with a conception of memory grounded in psychology and critique. I argue that this move away from memory as an artificial practice has obscured the classical art's visual precepts, consequently severing the ancient link between memory and invention. I suggest that contemporary rhetorical theorists should return to visualization to revitalize the fourth canon in the twenty-first century. Today, digital tools that visualize words and knowledge are ubiquitous. Framing data visualization as a twenty-first century analogue to the art of memory allows us to think about visualization as a tool for invention rather than as a reified representation of data. As creative remediations, memory palaces once allowed rhetoricians to interface with knowledge in an adaptable way and to imagine how knowledge might be assembled together in a new discourse. Thinking about data visualization as a memory palace thus enables us to think not only about representing data but about the new ways we might interface with it in order to generate insight. Data visualization becomes an art to facilitate invention, as the classical art of memory was designed to do."

In order to achieve high accuracy, Sakurai-Newton's alpha law MOSFET current model which includes the velocity saturation effects of carriers is used for modeling today's short-channel devices. Both p-MOS current and n-MOS current are taken into account in calculating the short-circuit current and energy. Input-output coupling and internal parasitic capacitance are carefully treated. The operation in sub-threshold region is also considered since sub-threshold leakage current now plays a meaningful role in determining the gates' starting point of conduction. In case of single-input switching, closed-form expressions for output waveforms and short-circuit energy consumption are derived for ramped input. We also developed a multiple-input switching model that captures interconnect effects, cross-capacitance and nonlinear capacitance for high level of accuracy. We then proposed a new transistor-level circuit simulator based on our multiple-input switching model. The runtime of the simulator is in proportion to the circuit scale while satisfactory accuracy is maintained. All the proposed techniques are validated by comparison with SPICE simulation on various CMOS circuits."
bce_etd_66,Voltage Effects on Cells Cultured On Metallic Biomedical Implants,Biomedical and Chemical Engineering,"apoptosis, CoCrMo, live-cell imaging, polarized metal, reduction electrochemistry","Electrochemical voltage shifts in metallic biomedical implants occur in-vivo due to a number of processes including mechanically assisted corrosion. Surface potential of biomedical implants and excursions from resting open circuit potential (OCP), which is the voltage they attain while in contact with an electrolyte, can significantly change the interfacial properties of the metallic surfaces and alter the behavior of the surrounding cells, compromising the biocompatibility of metallic implants. Voltages can also be controlled to modulate cell function and fate. To date, the details of the physico-chemical phenomena and the role of different biomaterial parameters involved in the interaction between cells and metallic surfaces under cathodic bias have not been fully elucidated.In this work, changes in the interfacial properties of a CoCrMo biomedical alloy (ASTM F-1537) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at different voltages was studied. Step polarization impedance spectroscopy technique was used to apply 50 mV voltage steps to samples, and the time-based current transients were recorded. A new equation was derived based on capacitive discharge through a Tafel element and generalized to deal with non-ideal impedance behavior. The new function compared to the KWW-Randles function, better matched the time-transient response. The results also showed a voltage dependent oxide resistance and capacitance behavior. Additionally, the in-vitro effect of static voltages on the behavior of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts cultured on CoCrMo alloy (ASTM-1537) was studied to determine the range of cell viability and mode of cell death beyond the viable range. Cell viability and morphology, changes in actin cytoskeleton, adhesion complexes and nucleus, and mode of cell death (necrosis, or intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis) were characterized at different voltages ranging from -1000 to +500 mV (Ag/AgCl). Moreover, electrochemical currents and metal ion concentrations at each voltage were measured and related to the observed responses. Results show that cathodic and anodic voltages outside the voltage viability range (-400 < V < +500) lead to primarily intrinsic apoptotic and necrotic cell death, respectively. Cell death is associated with cathodic current densities of 0.1 uAcm-2 and anodic current densities of 10 uAcm-2. Significant increase in metallic ions (Co, Cr, Ni, Mo) was seen at +500 mV, and -1000 mV (Cr only) compared to open circuit potential. The number and total projected area of adhesion complexes was also lower on the polarized alloy (p < 0.05). These results show that reduction reactions on CoCrMo alloys leads to apoptosis of cells on the surface and may be a relevant mode of cell death for metallic implants in-vivo.On the other hand, we studied how surface oxide thickness of Ti affects its voltage viability range and cellular response and whether anodic oxidation can serve as a means to extend this range. Cellular behavior (cell viability, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular adhesion) on bare and anodized Ti samples, potentiostatically held at voltages at the cathodic edge of the viability range, were assessed. Surfaces were characterized using contact angle (CA) measurement technique and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the observed cellular response was related to the changes in the electrochemical properties (electrochemical currents, open circuit potential, and impedance spectra) of the samples. Results show that anodization at a low voltage (9 V) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) generates a compact surface oxide with comparable surface roughness and energy to the starting native oxide on the bare surface. The anodized surface extends the viability range at 24 hours by about a 100 mV in the cathodic region, and preserved the cytoskeletal integrity and cell adhesion. Broadening of the viability range corresponds to an increase in impedance of the anodized surface at -400 mV(Ag/AgCl) and the resulting low average currents (below 0.1 uAcm-2) at the interface, which diminish the harmful cathodic reactions.Finally, cellular dynamics (size, polarity, movement) and temporal changes in the number and total area of focal adhesions in transiently transfected MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts cultured on a CoCrMo alloy polarized at the cathodic and anodic edges of its voltage viability range (-400 and +500 mV(Ag/AgCl) respectively) were studied. Nucleus dynamics (size, circularity, movement) and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also studied on the polarized metal at -1000, -400, and +500 mV(Ag/AgCl). The results show that at -400 mV(Ag/AgCl) a gradual loss of adhesion occurs over 24 hours while cells shrink in size during this time. At +500 mV, cells become non-viable after 5 hours without showing any significant changes in adhesion behavior right before cell death. Nucleus size of cells at -1000 mV decreased sharply within 15 minutes after electrochemical polarization, which rendered the cells completely non-viable. No significant amount of ROS was released by cells on the polarized CoCrMo at any of these voltages."
etd_747,Voluntary Adoption of Internal Audit by NASDAQ Firms and its Impact on Financial Reporting,Accounting,"Discretionary Accruals, Governance, Internal Audit, Material Weakness, Nasdaq, Value","While regulators recognize internal audit as an important governance function, the recent rejection by managers of NASDAQ firms of a proposal that would require NASDAQ listed firms to have an internal audit function indicates that management may not have the same regard for internal audit and may be unclear regarding internal audit’s value. Using hand-collected data for a sample of firms that have and have not voluntarily adopted an internal audit function, I run regressions to identify the impact of internal audit adoption on financial reporting and audit fees. I also identify the factors that drive the adoption decision. I find that internal audit satisfies demand for an objective monitoring function by reducing management opportunism and highlighting issues that may have otherwise gone unreported. Firms with internal audit have lower discretionary accruals and are more likely to report a material weakness. Firms also implement an internal audit function over time and as they become financially healthier and feel more external monitoring pressure (e.g., from debtholders). The findings suggests that notwithstanding the lack of a regulatory internal audit mandate, internal audit currently fulfills a natural demand for monitoring within NASDAQ firms and that a systematic internal audit adoption decision making process may already exist."
etd_446,Vortices and Quasiparticles in Superconducting Microwave Resonators,Physics,"magnetic flux vortices, microwave resonant circuits, (NIS)-tunnel junctions, Quasiparticles, Superconducting resonators, Superconductivity","Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are of great interest in many areas. However, the quality factor of the resonator can be weakened by many dissipation channels including trapped magnetic flux vortices and nonequilibrium quasiparticles which can significantly impact the performance of superconducting microwave resonant circuits and qubits at millikelvin temperatures. Quasiparticles result in excess loss, reducing resonator quality factors and qubit lifetimes. Vortices trapped near regions of large microwave currents also contribute excess loss. However, vortices located in current-free areas in the resonator or in the ground plane of a device can actually trap quasiparticles and lead to a reduction in the quasiparticle loss. In this thesis, we will describe experiments involving the controlled trapping of vortices for reducing quasiparticle density in the superconducting resonators. We provide a model for the simulation of reduction of nonequilibrium quasiparticles by vortices. In our experiments, quasiparticles are generated either by stray pair-breaking radiation or by direct injection using normal-insulator-superconductor (NIS)-tunnel junctions."
etd_750,"Water-Lords: Water Carriers in Beijing, 1644-1937",History,"Beijing, Drinking water, Environmental History, Urban History","This dissertation is about the story of water carriers in Beijing, who had distributed drinking water from wells to city residents according to a complicated and delicate system since the Qing period. The power of water carriers was rooted in their territories and native-place ties. Within their territories, water carriers emerged as a crucial force in shaping the social fabric and domestic rhythm of the neighborhood as the power in the back alleys. The power of water carriers remained potent and resilient with the arrival of Japanese well-drilling technology in the first decade of the twentieth century, the challenge of running water in 1910, and the introduction of state hygiene mandates in 1927.  The rise of the modern water enterprise, the state building and the changing nature of neighborhoods prompted the transformation of water carriers into water lords, while the individual ordinary residents ended up shouldering the unexpected burden of modernization. The state building in the Republican period was never to dismantle the power of water carriers since their campaigns barely addressed the issue of water distribution territories, the bedrock of the water carriers’ power. Instead, the state strove to mediate between water carriers and the running water company."
etd_54,Ways to Refuge: Bosnians in Central New York in Ethnographic Perspective,Anthropology,"Bosnians, Forced Migration, Immigration, Integration, Memory, Refugee","Ways to Refuge: Bosnians in Central New York in Ethnographic PerspectiveThis dissertation documents the resettlement experiences of Bosnian Muslims relocated to two urban locales in the north of New York State during and after the Bosnian War in the Balkans. To do so, it relies on ethnographic data gathered mainly through extensive interviews and participant-observation conducted over a period of fourteen months of fieldwork in a variety of places in Central New York.The dissertation provides individual- and group-level descriptions and analyses of various aspects of the diasporic experiences of the Bosnians encountered in the research, in addition to laying bare the diversity and heterogeneity observed among those experiences. More specifically, it offers a nuanced treatment of commemorative practice in the context of refugehood by considering the ways in which that practice is embedded in pedagogy, religious performance, cultural critique, and entertainment. In addition, the dissertation relativizes bureaucratic knowledge, i.e. the legal definition of refugee in the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and offers an experiential notion of refugeehood by identifying it as a cultural domain.Furthermore, the dissertation foregrounds the discipline's public and engagement roles by reminding of the need to intervene in debates about the impending immigration reform in the United States. To help prevent the issue of humanitarian protection from falling through the cracks during public and private negotiations over the reform, the dissertation brings the specificities of refugee migration to the fore by focusing on pre- and post-resettlement lives of Bosnians in the United States. Also, finding that several Bosnians interviewed in this project did not become U.S. citizens even though they were entitled to do so, the dissertation calls stakeholders responsible for the resettlement of refugees to more clearly communicate the value of citizenship as a civic virtue.Additionally, this dissertation examines why similarly positioned refugee immigrants, Bosnians in Central New York, sometimes seem to have different resettlement experiences. Bosnians relocated to the region as a result of the armed violence in the Balkans in early 1990s, and are very similar or identical in terms of their ethnicity, reasons for displacement, context of resettlement, access to means of integration, rules and regulations of resettlement each followed. Despite this, a nostalgic, relatively non-entrepreneurial and only belatedly organizational discourse characterizes the resettlement experiences of several Bosnians in Syracuse. This discourse is nostalgic in that my interviews with Bosnians in this group commonly include statements desirous of return to where one came from; it is relatively non-entrepreneurial as manifested in my observations among this group of a lower degree of business establishment and ownership; and due to a variety of reasons discussed in the dissertation, the time span between arrival in the country of permanent resettlement -United States- and the creation of a local community organization is, comparatively speaking, is a wide one. Whereas, a subsection of Bosnians in Utica is adopting the new place as their own and improving the local economy. Signs of this adoption include common interview responses desirous of making the United States into a home, much higher number of small-sized businesses owned and operated in the respective locale, as well as the remarkable coming-into-being of a community organization, the Bosnian Islamic Association of Utica, in such a short period of time as would astound the mayor of the city hosting the Bosnians in question. This dissertation examines how these differences may link to a number of factors including urban vs. rural backgrounds, differential wartime experiences, and the specifics of the resettlement locales. It concerns the transformations various individuals, who formally transitioned into America as refugees, are effecting and undergoing in the American metropolis.The dissertation contributes to the scholarship on Bosnian diaspora, in particular to the literature addressing various aspects of Bosnians' post-war experiences in the United States. In addition, the dissertation adds to anthropological discussions of sociocultural change by introducing the conceptual tool of supermobility. Illustrated mainly with reference to the adaptive practices of a specific individual, this heuristic paves the way for a non-sedentary perspective toward adaptation and repositions mobility as a form of proactive choice. The dissertation foregrounds the role of refugee mobility as a generative and adaptive process in which refugee individuals act in ways that defy popular perceptions of them as helpless, public-resource-depleting, and maladaptive guests. Furthermore, with its focus on a specific group of refugees in Central New York, this work additionally seeks to help reverse an unwelcome trend in social sciences, which is the dwindling number of scholarly works on refugees."

This study aims to determine how CSR communication strategies differ between China and the United States by comparing the purpose, main stakeholders, types of CSR programs, compliance with the International CSR standards, and the existence of CSR annual reports.  This study is based on recent discussion and theory-building efforts in public relations literature regarding evolving CSR practices.  The overarching theoretical framework will be the so-called stakeholder theory and CSR communication strategy.  The results will show that U.S. companies have a more mature development of CSR communication on their websites than do Chinese companies; Chinese companies are still engaged in Stakeholder information strategies, while U.S. companies disclose CSR information by using different communication strategies; although there's no significant difference in CSR annual reporting between Chinese and U.S. companies, the framework for CSR reporting standards in China is still at a very rudimentary stage."

This dissertation explores the health consequences associated with race, nativity, and pre-pregnancy body mass index among Black and White women giving birth in the Central New York region using data from the 2004 through 2010 New York Statewide Perinatal Data System. It examines the likelihood of the occurrence of a preterm birth or low birth weight birth. This study also examines racial disparities in birth outcomes between Black women and White women overall in addition to nativity disparities in birth outcomes among Black women. This research finds that underweight, rather than obese, women are particularly at risk for poor birth outcomes. In addition, the idea of an obesity paradox is supported, in which obese women were significantly less likely than normal weight pre-pregnancy BMI women to have a baby born too early or too small. This research also reveals that comparable morbidity profiles among Black women eliminate the foreign-born advantage with regard to nativity disparities in low birth weight. Finally, differences in prenatal care counseling received and a lower amount of physical activity during pregnancy appears to eliminate the advantage that African women experience regarding low birth weight in comparison to U.S.-born Black women. In general, this dissertation addresses the embodiment of racial inequality and its adverse effects on health outcomes among Black women"
etd_676,What Counts as Desiring the Actual Good?,Philosophy,"ethics, moral character, moral psychology, moral responsibility","Here is a simple observation about moral character: Moral virtue apparently consists, at least in large part, in caring about the right things. When we imagine a virtuous agent, we find that she cares about particular considerations, and that her caring is at least part of what makes her virtuous. One cannot be fully virtuous, for example, unless one cares at least somewhat about the welfare of others. Here is a corollary: At least sometimes, agents are morally vicious because they do not care about the right things. An agent who just doesn't care whether others live or die should, for example, strike us as severely vicious.And here, from Hume, is a simple observation about moral responsibility: In order for an agent to be blameworthy or praiseworthy for an action, that action must reflect something about that agent. This observation, too, is supported by common intuitions. Agents seem to be blameworthy when and because their actions reflect something bad about their moral character, and they seem praiseworthy when and because their actions reflect something good about their moral character. And we are generally reluctant to attribute blameworthiness in cases in which circumstances prevent an agent's character from being reflected in his actions – we typically excuse agents whose bad actions result from delusions or uncontrollable impulses, for example.Here, finally, is an appealing synthesis of these observations. Agents are blameworthy for actions that reflect their moral vices, and moral vices consist, at least in large part, in having the wrong attitudes towards certain considerations. Therefore, it seems that agents are blameworthy when their actions reflect such attitudes. And, since virtues consist, at least in large part, in having the right attitudes towards certain considerations, agents will be praiseworthy for actions that reflect these attitudes. This synthesis is also intuitively plausible. An agent who stands idly by and watches a child drown seems not only vicious in virtue of his indifference to human life, but blameworthy in virtue of the fact that this indifference is reflected in his action. And an agent who makes significant sacrifices to help others is not only virtuous in virtue of her great concern for others, but also praiseworthy when she exercises her virtue.The preceding observations raise two obvious questions: Which considerations are relevant to virtue and moral worth, and which attitudes are the “appropriate” ones to have towards these considerations? A recently-influential family of views (Arpaly 2002, 2003, 2006; Markovits 2010, 2012, Arpaly and Schroeder 2014a) offers a procedure for answering these questions. The considerations relevant to virtue and moral worth, according to these views, are the considerations that the correct normative theory identifies as relevant to determining the deontic status of an action, and the appropriate attitude towards a particular consideration is determined by that consideration's role as right-making or wrong-making. Thus, a virtuous agent will have positive or pro- attitudes towards those considerations that make actions good or right, and negative or anti- attitudes towards those considerations that make actions bad or wrong. Call accounts of this kind actual good (AG) accounts. A number of considerations count in favor of AG accounts. As noted, they do an excellent job of accommodating several intuitively plausible observations about character and moral worth. They are also equipped to provide intuitively plausible attributions of moral worth in a range of important cases.But there are additional desiderata for an account of virtue and moral worth. Attributions of moral worth are not merely of theoretical interest but also of practical importance, as they are likely to have implications for which agents we should reward or punish. And while the correct attributions of virtue and moral worth seem to be obvious in some cases, they are not obvious in others. In particular, there are a number of socially, legally, and morally important cases of wrongdoing in which it is not intuitively clear how we should evaluate the agents in question. These include the case of the psychopath; they also include cases of ideologically-motivated agents who act badly as the result of false moral beliefs. Preferably, our account of virtue and moral worth would be useful in guiding our judgments of moral worth in these difficult, real-world cases. Ideally, it would be complete, in the sense that it would offer a generalized procedure for assessing moral worth in all cases: Our account would take the correct normative theory as an input, along with the attitudes reflected in an agent's action, and then act as a function that outputs an unambiguous judgment of moral worth.I argue that existing AG accounts are not complete in this sense, as there are realistic problem cases in which these accounts struggle to provide an unambiguous judgment of moral worth. That there are such cases at all means that there is a theoretical problem, and that we do not yet have a complete account of moral worth. That some of these cases are realistic means that there is also a practical problem, as these are precisely the cases in which we may need to rely on our account to guide our judgments. The reason that certain cases are problematic, briefly, is that normative theories identify a range of features of actions as right-making and wrong-making. Because an action can reflect appropriate attitudes towards some of these features while reflecting inappropriate attitudes towards others, our account will produce different attributions of moral worth depending on which of an agent's attitudes we evaluate him against.Fortunately, I argue, this problem can be solved. It will require us to develop a further procedure for determining which attitudes, towards which right- and wrong-making features, we should use to evaluate agents. This in turn will require us to address a further substantive question as to which kinds of attitudes count, for the purposes of assessing character and moral worth, as appropriate or inappropriate attitudes towards that which is actually good or bad. Once this work has been done, however, we will have an account of moral worth that is much more powerful, and that is able to provide unambiguous judgments in the cases which were previously problematic. This strengthened account has potentially surprising consequences when applied to the real world, implying, for instance, that psychopaths are morally blameworthy, and that many seemingly well-meaning agents are morally vicious."

A 2015 CSR audit of the top 25 Fortune 500 Companies.,Public Relations,"Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR, Fortune 500","What Does Corporate Social Responsibility Mean to Fortune 500 Companies and Why?A 2015 CSR audit of the top 25 Fortune 500 Companies.Delisa MorrisCorporate social responsibility has become an essential function in modern business.  The purpose of this study was to show the societal benefits and the vast possibility of CSR programs.  The top 25 Fortune 500 companies were chosen for this study because they were leaders within each industry with business functions worldwide.  Lastly, the purpose of this research is to find out how companies translate CSR into business benefits.This study used a qualitative content analysis to determine the trends of the top 25 Fortune 500 corporations.  The content that was analyzed were the CSR webpages of each company’s website and formal CSR reports where they were available.  15 codes were identified from the content.  Coding revealed the grants/foundations had the most participation by the corporations followed by environmental sustainability.   Corporate giving through grants and corporate foundations is one of the original forms of CSR, which explains why that was the code with the most participation.  The code with the least participation was the conflict minerals code.  Proceeds from the sale of conflict minerals perpetuate unrest in war torn countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  This code probably had the least participation because most of the businesses reviewed did not need to purchase minerals for business operations.  Another reason that this code had the least participation was the likelihood that taking a firm stance against conflict minerals could interrupt business relationships with foreign countries.The following research questions were addressed:•	RQ1: Are CSR initiatives consistent within each industry?•	RQ2: If applicable, how do companies measure the impact of their CSR efforts?•	RQ3: Where are most CSR efforts concentrated, and in what areas are CSR efforts lacking?•	RQ4: How did the company choose its CSR efforts and why?The content analysis revealed that the only industries that had consistent CSR initiatives were food and drug stores and general merchandisers.  There was no clear or consistent way that corporations measured the impact of their CSR efforts.  Most corporations that produced formal CSR reports measured the impact of CSR by comparing the year being reported to the previous year or measuring the year being reported against future goals.  Most CSR efforts were concentrated in the areas of grants/foundation, environmental sustainability and education.  Lastly, there was no concrete information about why companies chose their CSR efforts, but most companies chose CSR efforts that aligned with their corporate missions and values."
etd_404,"What is the Relationship Between the Degree Middle Schools Implement the Essential Elements, Student Achievement and the Programs and Practices Applied in Each School",Teaching and Leadership,"best practices, middle grades, middle school, NYS Essential Elements, poverty, student achievement","By 2003, both the New York State Board of Regents Policy Statement and the new Commissioner’s Regulation 100.4, required all middle level programs to implement a set of policies and practices called the NYS Essential Elements of Standards-Focused Middle-Level Schools and Programs. Early adolescence (ages 10-14) is a time when students experience, the most tumultuous physical and mental changes occur during adolescence, with the exception of a child’s first year of life (Montessori, 2004). Middle grade level philosophy and a description of what middle schools should be like are directly linked to taking a balanced approach to meeting the social, emotional, intellectual and academic needs of students in the middle grades. Many of these beliefs became the foundation of middle grade level education and they serve as the principles of the NYS Essential Elements.The New York State Education Department (NYSED) never enforced its own middle grade regulations and has provided little support to help school leaders understand and implement the Essential Elements. Some observers insist that the practices required by the Essential Elements can play a critical role in supporting students’ learning, while others treat practices that do not directly address their academic learning as “extras” that only the wealthiest school districts can afford. Recently, public schools in New York State have faced financial difficulties trying to manage many changes to their instructional and evaluative practices. School leaders often struggle to know what decisions to make that will improve the culture within the school and earn higher student achievement ratings on state tests. How would applying the NYS Essential Elements impact the culture in the building and the test scores of its students?This study compares the ways in which four schools implement the NYS Essential Elements and explores whether and how their implementation of the Elements may have affected three years of student achievement scores on the NYS math and ELA, 8th grade test. Both surveys and follow up interviews were used to collect data to measure the degree each school implemented the NYS Essential Elements. A basic statistical analysis was used to explain the survey data. Interview data was coded to facilitate analysis. The study investigates how and why schools apply the NYS Essential Elements and the impact they may have on the academic and social fabric within each school.Results of the study indicated that all four schools implemented the NYS Essential Elements to a moderate or above moderate degree. The school that implemented the NYS Essential Element to the greatest degree also had the highest test scores in math and second highest in ELA in spite of having a high percentage of students living in poverty. Another school that had the highest percentage of students living in poverty implemented the Essential Elements to the second highest degree and performed as well on state tests as the school with lower rates of poverty and implementation. The two high need schools in the study performed as well or better than the average need schools. The study provides reasons to believe that applying the NYS Essential Elements can help students overcome the hurdles of poverty and achieve at a higher rate.This study contributes to the body of literature about middle level philosophy and practices. Four school case studies provide an in depth look at how and why the NYS Essential Elements of Standards Focused Middle Level Schools and Programs benefit middle school students. The study also reveals the importance of taking a balanced approach to middle grade education, making time to meet the specific needs of students and having school leaders consider the NYS Essential Elements to guide them through difficult decisions."

Colonial Reconstruction and the Commission of Government, 1933-1941",Geography,"Colonialism, Commission of Government, Development, Newfoundland, Subjects, Territory","On 21 December 1933, The Newfoundland Act was passed in British Parliament. In the midst of economic crisis, Newfoundland uniquely, and voluntarily, relinquished self-rule. Fifteen years later in 1949, Newfoundland joined Canada. In the intervening years Newfoundland was ruled by a British-established Commission of Government. My dissertation is an historical-geographic analysis of the attempted reconstruction and rehabilitation of Newfoundland by British colonial authorities during the 1930s and 1940s. It draws on materials from Newfoundland and London archives, such as a range of official documents, maps, oral histories, travel narratives, diaries, newspapers, scientific reports, statistical collections, and secondary historical literature. Through a study of how Newfoundland was approached and interpreted by the Commission of Government during the island's moment of crisis, I analyze the complex transition from a colonial welfare approach to rebuilding Newfoundland to a modernist scientific approach. This transformation, I argue, is crucial to understanding the politics of both development austerity in 1930s Newfoundland, and the emergence of post-World War Two development regimes on the island. To expand this argument, I examine how British colonial development discourses, formulated in a variety of global settings, from Africa and the Caribbean to India and Britain, set the terms for debate and limits of possibility surrounding Newfoundland. My work, thus, connects Newfoundland to international comparative global networks of science and expertise. It shows that the modernist approach to developing and managing Newfoundland's population and resources has deeper origins than the post-war development arising from a North-American context. Those origins lie in the intricate local applications of Britain's late-imperial global development doctrines to understandings of Newfoundland as a place and a society."
etd_251,Where the Reasons Come From,Philosophy,,"We have a problem understanding our normative reasons. If there's a reason to do x, we can explain why that reason counts in favor of doing it with the fact that x-ing would be good in some way. But it's also explainable by non-evaluative properties that make x-ing good. Suppose the traffic gives us a reason to leave early for the airport. The deeper reason might be the non-evaluative fact that the traffic would cause us to miss our flight, or it might be the value of making the flight. Although both reasons are perfectly good at the everyday level, it would be wrong to say they both contribute to the fundamental normative story of why traffic favors leaving early. Because both are ways of calling attention to the same idea, that making the flight is our goal, they shouldn't be independent. One of these considerations is a reason only because the other is. If we considered each as its own self-contained reason we'd be double-counting. So which is the more fundamental one? I argue that values--goodness and badness of various kinds--give our best, most ultimate reasons."
etd_325,"Which Jobs for Which Boys? Party Financing, Patronage and State Capacity in African Democracies",Political Science,"Africa, Development, Patronage, Political Economy, Political Parties, State Capacity","Both Benin and Ghana are amongst Africa's most celebrated examples of democratic success, but there is growing divergence in the capacity of their state institutions to act as effective agents of development. Why? This dissertation argues that modes of party financing are integral to understanding patterns of patronage-based recruitment to public office, and that these patronage practices have consequences for the broader developmental capacities of the state.The first part of the dissertation shows that leaders use political patronage not only as a means of ""buying"" votes, but more fundamentally as a means of exerting control over the state's resources. How leaders choose to access and control these resources depends on the size of the private sector and the strength of party organizations, both of which vary considerably across African countries. Where party organizations are strong and the private sector large, patronage is likely to be concentrated primarily at the elite level to facilitate the exchange of contracts for financial support to the party. Conversely, where private capital is more scarce, leaders will concentrate patronage at the public service level, enabling political supporters to access state revenue and rents for their party.These varying patronage practices have consequences for the broader developmental capacities of the state. Elite level patronage leads to more stability and cohesion in the executive which, among other things, strengthens commitment to development programs over time even in the face of serious implementation challenges. High levels of public service patronage, by contrast, heighten organizational problems including technical deficiencies amongst public personnel, the frequent disappearance of state resources for political use and excessive control over bureaucratic agencies. This latter environment is particularly challenging for the implementation of development programs.The argument is developed by combining comparative case analysis of Benin and Ghana with medium-N cross national analysis on a broader set of African countries. The case analysis draws on three principal sources of data collected in both countries, including 1) a comprehensive database containing appointment and biographical information on all cabinet ministers from the early 1990s through 2013, 2) an original survey of over 500 civil servants in each country and 3) interviews with approximately 60 political and state actors. Together, the data allow for a novel empirical strategy that considers patronage across both elite and public service levels of the executive apparatus, and lends considerable support to a party-financing based explanation of the relationship between multi-party politics, patronage and state institutional capacity.Although the neopatrimonial perspective in African politics often leads us to believe that patronage is both ubiquitous and uniformly detrimental to African states, this project shows otherwise. Instead the dissertation's findings suggest the need to consider not only how much patronage, but which jobs are distributed and to whom. In so doing, the project moves away from monotonic conceptions of the relationship between democracy and state capacity, asking instead how multi-party politics interact with neopatrimonial forms of authority to produce variation in state institutional capacity."

A detailed evaluation of communityinvolvement at Superfund sites (via the Technical Assistance Grant, or TAG, Program) wasperformed by researching a specific type of complex, highly-technical policy problem, using amixed methods approach, incorporating a quantitative econometric evaluation and qualitativemultiple case study of selected Superfund sites.The existing literature on public participation argues that citizen involvement is central todemocratic decision-making and is an important part of the policy process. This study wasrooted in a series of research questions about public participation in technical settings. Thesequestions addressed the attributes of successful participation, the characteristics of technicalpolicy issues that could lead to gaps in successful participation, the expected impact of theSuperfund TAG program in addressing these gaps, and questions about the specific impacts ofthe TAG program at Superfund sites on outcomes (schedule, remedy selected, and communityperceptions and satisfaction with the outcomes).The Superfund program has the hallmark characteristics of a highly technical, complexpolicy situation – it is characterized by technical complexity, solutions to the problems areexpensive, public involvement is expensive, the process is slow, and the technical partiestypically have better access to information than does the public. The quantitative research hereinidentified several drivers for obtaining a TAG and demonstrated the impact of a TAG onschedule and remedy. The case studies provided support for the expectations about barriers topublic participation in complex, technical settings, and expectations about the ability of theTAG program to address some of the participation gaps. The research also identified areas forpublic participation improvement, through providing independent technical advisors, support forestablishment of community networks, support for citizen advocates, and agency support forcapacity building."

The All Means All Project began when two university professors called into question the practice of placing students with disabilities in segregated special classrooms. Their goal was to create a collaborative, multi-dimensional approach to providing all students with access to rigorous academic instruction and promoting a sense of belonging through students' full-time membership in general education classrooms. This reform was an immense undertaking because it required stakeholders to question their established policies and practices, engage in targeted professional development, and restructure the school's staff and students in order to close two self-contained special education classrooms.With the support of the district superintendent, the director of special education, and Kennedy School administrators, the university professors began holding monthly, voluntary, afterschool meetings with school personnel. Because teachers and administrators are integral participants in this process, I sought to understand how they understood the project philosophically and how they experienced the reform process practically by utilizing participant observation and semi-structured interviews over a period of two years.Restructuring of this magnitude disrupted the existing order of business at Kennedy School and some stakeholders struggled to critically reflect upon the meanings they brought to this transition. Dominant cultural narratives about students, and about schooling, were challenged as many teachers and administrators sought to replace these narratives with counter narratives. This dissertation draws attention to the tendency for stakeholders to backslide into more familiar narratives when they feel challenged.Eventually Kennedy School stakeholders recognized benefits for students and for teachers based on their restructuring efforts. They created a mantra about whole-school inclusive reform, ""It's what's best for kids!"" that seemed to sustain them through difficult days. Kennedy School stakeholders demonstrated the possibilities of what can happen when teachers and administrators are willing to take risks to educate all students."
etd_455,"Whose Honey, Whose Hive?: Genre and Rhetorical Agency in the U.S. Colony Collapse Disorder",Writing Program,"agricultural rhetoric, composition, environmental communication, environmental rhetoric, genre, narrative","This dissertation analyzes the rhetoric surrounding the environmental crisis of the honey bee Colony Collapse Disorder, commonly known as CCD. Since 2007, the United States has lost on average a third of its honey bee colonies each year to CCD. The crisis has potentially serious environmental consequences. Without honey bee pollination services, over $14 billion worth of crops in the United States alone are in jeopardy. Drawing on environmental rhetoric, genre theory, and agricultural rhetorics, I offer a rhetorical analysis and genre analysis of the narratives surrounding CCD from select popular press newspaper articles, documentaries, nonfiction works, and personal interviews with beekeepers that cover the span of the early years of the U.S. crisis from 2007 to 2011.I argue that specific narratives of CCD offered by stakeholders such as scientists, reporters, beekeepers, policymakers, and environmentalists both constrained and invited deliberation about the synergistic causes of the crisis. One narrative I examine in detail in Chapter Two is the nesting genre of the “crime mystery” of CCD in news stories that often reduced consideration of the causes of CCD to a warring search for a pathogenic solution. This focus on a “smoking gun” for CCD focused the public’s attention on scientists seeking a single solution instead of considering multi-factoral causes. The genre also reduced consideration of the multiple roles stakeholders played in the crisis. In contrast, beekeepers’ protests, insights and perspectives (Chapters Three and Four) and the trope “listening to bees” popular in nonfiction media (Chapter Five) expanded consideration of systemic economic and cultural causes for the crisis, and allowed bees and beekeepers to emerge as informative agents. This project considers, too, how American beekeepers have approached CCD in largely individualistic terms in contrast to French beekeepers who have collectively organized in large groups to protest their sense that CCD was caused by the sale of a pesticide by the Bayer Corporation.I apply rhetorical and genre analysis to representations of CCD in popular media and beekeepers’ discourse. I cite stakeholders such as scientists, researchers, journalists, beekeepers, and protestors. This dissertation contributes to scholarship in environmental rhetoric and environmental communication that analyzes the narratives and causes of environmental crises. This project evaluates the solutions and challenges that varied stakeholders have posed, specifically through analyzing the shaping and impact of their narratives. Ultimately, the concluding chapter argues for the trope of “listening to bees,” the idea that bees are a critical indicator species whose behavior informs how we should approach and potentially solve this crisis."
cfe_etd_55,"Whose Streets? Our Streets!: Identity, Institutions, and Privilege in Student Activism",Cultural Foundations of Education,"Activism, Education, Higer Education, Youth Culture","This dissertation is a qualitative ethnography of college student activism that examines student activist identity, and the role of social structures and privilege in activism. The study uses data from two years of in-depth fieldwork including over 18 months of participant observation and interviews with 13 key respondents. I took on this research project to better understand how students come to think of themselves as activists, how they speak about and experience activism, how activism--as a cultural text--tells a story about power and privilege, and to explore the role of education in the culture of activism. In this dissertation I argue that student activism is a practice of democratic citizenship that is complicated by the contradictions and complexities of students' uninterrogated privileges. Mobilizing as a collective, students challenge normative notions of youth and youth subcultures through extracurricular activities and practices that include public and self-education. Activist work includes navigating contradictions granted by identity privilege and serves as a contested space where social inequities and relations of power and privilege are rejected, interrogated, and reinforced. Student activism, as a subculture and a lifestyle, becomes informal schooling for privileged youth offering lessons which bridge the gap between the disconnected realities of school, individual experience, and group work in the ""real world."" In this way, activist work and pedagogy provides students with opportunities to engage with the discomfort of privilege. Even as students are confronted with contradictions of their own privileged identities, their political agenda as anti-racist, anti-oppression allies continually push them to better understand their role as privileged actors in a world of injustice."
etd_127,Wideband Phased Array Design and Characterization,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"antenna, flared notch, multioctave, phased array, scattering, wideband","This dissertation presents the empirical design and electrical characterization of a unique antenna element suitable for use in polarization diverse wide frequency bandwidth phased arrays. The development of this wideband phased array antenna for use in airborne multi-function radar and electronic warfare systems is discussed in the context of the advancement of monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology. The general behavior of several classes of frequency independent antennas and their applicability for wideband phased arrays are examined. The emergence of the stripline-fed flared notch antenna as the best-suited element type for finite wideband phased arrays is discussed in terms of antenna performance, array architecture, and compatibility with Bragg lobe restrictions.Both conformal and non-conformal versions of wide frequency bandwidth antenna designs are investigated for their electrical performance behavior over a multi-octave frequency bandwidth. A unique non-conformal antenna element is achieved by combining, with a power divider, two like-polarized flared notch antennas into a two-element subarray. This subarray element is essential in creating double density arrays that meet octave bandwidth antenna grating lobe and multi-octave bandwidth Bragg lobe lattice spacing restrictions. Several single and double density arrays with both linear and dual polarizations are designed, built, and measured to characterize in situ array-element performance behavior. This in situ array-element antenna performance includes scan impedance, scan element pattern, and gain.The dissertation also discusses the parallel advent of electromagnetic formulations and computer simulation codes capable of modeling and predicting the radiation and scattering of complex integrated phased array and radome problems. Simulations are presented that provide insight into the near-field behavior of antenna radome interactions. The resonances visible in the near-field are shown to create significant distortions in the far-field antenna and scattering patterns. An application of electromagnetic computer simulation in illustrating a complex antenna and radome integration problem is presented. The potential benefit of using electromagnetic simulation software to optimize the gain and scattering of an integrated aircraft leading edge phased array and radome of complex media is detailed.The application of this wideband stripline flared notch design in two demonstration phased arrays are presented in terms of both architectural design and electrical performance. Both a single density linear polarized array and double density dual polarized phased array are discussed. The double density array is shown to be advantageous in reducing the number of T/R modules in wideband planar phased arrays. An improvement in the E-plane scan impedance is shown in double density arrays with closely spaced antenna array-elements. The use of radar absorbing material in the double density array also enhances the H-plane beamwidth, cross-polarization level, and gain performance."
etd_643,Women as Fish: Physical Movement and Social Mobility in Contemporary Vietnam,Anthropology,"Migration, Mobilities, Morality, Rural, Social Class, Vietnam","This dissertation examines the changing rurality and the profound social stratification in contemporary Vietnam through the lens of rural-to-rural female migration. It is based on eighteen months of ethnographic research in a rural offshore fishing community in northern Vietnam called H?i Thành. I study the migration of two groups of women: 1) transnational women, who are young H?i Thành girls that marry Taiwanese and South Korean men, and migrate to mostly rural areas in East Asia, and 2) translocal women, who are women from other rural Vietnamese communities who migrate to H?i Thành to marry local men. My dissertation analyzes the relationship between movement and social class. It shows how female migration both sustains and transforms social hierarchies and binaries in unexpected ways via the embodiment of ethnicity, class, gender, age, and rurality, and practices of beauty, migration, education and morality. The double rural-to-rural female migration pattern in H?i Thành indicates that movement and social stratification are indicative of a complex rural landscape, and productive of modern and gendered rural subjectivities in Vietnam, which are produced through multiple political, cultural, historical and economic forces."
etd_155,"Writing and the Internationalization of U.S. Higher Education: The Roles of Ideology, Administration, and the Institution",Writing Program,"Composition and Rhetoric, English language learners, Higher Education, Internationalization, Second Language Writing, Writing Program Administration","In this dissertation,Writing and the Internationalization of U.S. Higher Education: The Roles of Ideology, Administration, and the Institution, I examine one private institution, Syracuse University, for how it has approached internationalization (both currently and in historical efforts), how it has dealt with the increased presence of English language learners (ELLs), and how both realities may affect the research and practice of writing program administrators (WPAs). I use scholarship from Second Language Writing and Writing Program Administration as frameworks for examining some of the sociopolitics involved in addressing the new needs of an internationalized higher education institution, including the politics and ideologies that may impede WPA work but may not always be readily apparent. I draw on institutional research in the forms of archival research, interviews with university administrators, and an administrative case study of one graduate-level writing course for ELLs.This dissertation project can be seen as culminating in two separate but intermingling qualitative studies. First, based on interviews with fourteen university administrators, I illustrate that some the most pressing concerns currently perceived at SU include cross-cultural conflict, a lack of resources for ELLs, and the need for increased and different kinds of institutional support, particularly since the effects of internationalization at SU have typically been handled after the fact rather than preemptively through strategic systemic planning. Then, based on rhetorical analysis of historical institutional data and archival materials, I exemplify how past efforts to internationalize were infused with separatist, colonialist, and ethnocentric points of view. I argue that applying institutional research to WPAs' local university contexts for the purposes of revealing current materialities and longstanding ideologies can enhance WPAs' abilities to locate opportunities for rhetorically negotiating change that is needed.In my second qualitative study that informs this dissertation, I investigate the administrative practices and politics involved when implementing new writing resources on behalf of ELLs in higher education institutions. I provide an administrative praxis narrative describing my development and piloting of a graduate-level writing course for ELL students wherein I analyze the departmental and institutional constraints traversed. This situated and site-specific study--which is informed by participant-observations, field notes, course materials, and interviews with fourteen student participants and one writing instructor--further exemplifies some of the benefits and challenges of institutional research. I catalog many issues and obstacles WPAs may need to consider as they navigate the often opaque and power-infused institutional spaces in which they participate and seek to change, including issues of sustainability, institutional backing, and the politics of remediation.To conclude this dissertation, I offer suggestions for future inquiry and propose a transdirectional model for institutional research and administrative practice. This model aims to account for a wider range of institutional realities as sites for determining transformational possibilities that better respond to linguistic and cultural diversity in higher education."
etd_628,Young Adult Dating Violence and Coercive Control:  A Comparative Analysis of Men and Women’s Victimization and Perpetration Experiences,Child and Family Studies,"coercive control, dating violence, gender, intimate partner violence, sexual violence","This study provides a comparative analysis of young adult men and women’s experiences of dating violence and coercive control using a feminist theoretical framework, and tests the applicability of Johnson’s typology of intimate partner violence to young adult dating relationships. Participants reported on their experiences of violence and coercive control, as well as resulting mental health outcomes, injury, and fearfulness of their partner in a recent dating relationship (past or current; casual or committed), as well as individual gender ideologies and attitudes toward intimate partner violence.  In the current study, nearly one-quarter of young adults experienced violent dating relationships, 44% experienced abusive relationships (high levels of coercive control and/or violence), and nearly one-fifth experienced highly coercively controlling relationships (no violence).  Despite some similarities in men and women’s experiences of dating violence, women were more likely to have experienced multiple forms of violence, be victims of sexual violence, and to experience significantly greater injury and fear toward abusive partners, thus supporting the idea of gender asymmetry in dating violence. Hypergender ideologies and accepting attitudes toward intimate partner violence also predicted the use of coercive control for women and men, and physical violence perpetration for women.  Additional typologies of violence were found in addition to those proposed by Johnson."
