Methods  : 71 newly diagnosed stroke patients from two  local hospitals received a self-report Likert-type questionnaire  consisting of eight domains related to different aspects of stroke  education. The questionnaire was distributed 24 to 72 hours after  admission to the hospital, upon discharge, and two weeks postdischarge.   Analysis  : The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's r, and repeated measures analysis of variance.  Results  : Medical knowledge and medication treatment were rated the most  important to learn. Treatment of stroke with herbal or alternative  medicine and dietary habits were the least important of the eight  domains. Patients were not satisfied with stroke education.
