$ABSTRACT:
This study identifies overall patterns of parental efficacy, practices, family functioning, familism, and acculturation among Korean immigrant families. Also, it investigates parental efficacy and practices in Korean immigrant families related to family functioning, familism, and acculturation. The sample of this study consisted of 202 first generation Korean immigrant parents. The hypothetical models derived substantially from an ecological framework, a microsociological theory, and a social systems theory were partially supported. Although the meaning of the empirical findings is much more complicated than expected, one salient point revealed is Korean immigrant parents' strong attachment to the culture of origin. Discussion and suggestions for future study are described.
