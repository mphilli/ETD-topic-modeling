$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation explores how Christian gamers expressed  challenges to their identities after confronting moral choices in four popular  console video games. Gamer posts in online discussion forums provided the texts  needed to examine these possible position shifts. Game titles and scenes emerged  from those discussions, which lead to textual and iconographic analysis of these  sessions. The results strongly suggest that video games, like other media,  transmit dominant ideology to consumers. The data revealed that these Christian  gamers largely accepted dominant hegemonic messages. However some players  negotiated with or opposed the texts in ways that revealed how their identity  influenced their perceptions of the consequences of game play. Moreover some of  these gamers suspect that how they played games might impact their moral  character. In providing these results, this study helps to fill a void in  academic video game research that for decades has centered on violent and  misogynistic content. However this dissertation is only the first step in the  process of determining how gamers negotiate with their texts and in doing so  accept or resist hegemonic content.
