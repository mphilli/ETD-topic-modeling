$ABSTRACT:
The main aims of this study are: 1. To further advance knowledge on a particular form of collective behavior and to understand the process of social change; 2. To analyze and explain the essential determinants of the birth control movement; 3. To determine if this specific case study of the birth control movement supports Smelser’s propositions on  norm-oriented (social) movements; and 4.  To assess the question: Does the general theory of “collective behavior” as it is usually applied, have much heuristic value?
