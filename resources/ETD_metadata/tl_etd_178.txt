$ABSTRACT:
The fundamental issue investigated in this dissertation has been how teaching is perceived from the vantage point of the seasoned teacher, the literature, and the preservice teacher. More specifically, an attempt has been made to analyze the concept of teaching developed from these three perspectives.The first voice heard in the study, the voice of the experienced practitioner, was presented in the context of an evolutionary journey from the elementary school classroom through graduate school. The literature's voice was analyzed from a multi perspective. Qualitative research was used to explore the perceptions of the novice toward teaching. Information was obtained over a one year period using the journal writing entries of college students from practicum and student teaching experiences.Several overarching findings emerged from this study. The inside voice of the practicing teacher evolved from one who initially perceived the worlds of research and the classroom as disconnected to a place of understanding where research findings could improve the overall progress of students in classrooms. Comparisons are then made among the experienced teacher's, the literature's, and the transitional voice's perceptions of classroom life.Findings indicate that the three voices perceive classroom life very differently. Suggestions are given for the development of an integrated voice. Recommendations are presented as to what circumstances are most likely to enable all three voices to listen and learn from each other in order to affect pedagogical change.
