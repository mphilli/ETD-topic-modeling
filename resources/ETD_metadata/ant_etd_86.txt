$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this research is to understand the meanings and  perceptions that families, teachers, and school-based service providers on the  Westside in Syracuse, New York ascribe to school-based mental health services.  The Westside is an economically disadvantaged and under-resourced neighborhood  where children experience a great deal of stress in everyday life. Many children  in need of mental health care are referred to school-based mental health service  providers by their teachers. The primary motivation of this research is to  understand how parents and school staff give meaning to the school-based mental  health services and how these meanings affect whether they decide to access such  services for their children. This research will explore what it means to the  families when a child is identified as requiring mental health care and how the  identification affects families. The methods I will use include in-depth  interviews and focus groups with parents and guardians with children who have  been identified in school as in need of mental health services. Interviews with  school-based teachers, health providers and case coordinators will also be  utilized. In addition to the interviews, I will conduct participant observation  in the school classrooms and health offices in the four elementary and two  middle schools located on the Westside. By understanding how individuals in each  of these groups perceive school-based mental health services and observing the  coordination and delivery of services, it may be possible to find discrepancies  between perceptions. These differences may provide insight into recommendations  for more effective services that meet the needs of youth on the Westside.
