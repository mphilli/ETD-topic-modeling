$ABSTRACT:
The overall purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which the conditions that facilitate change have been present in higher education instructional improvement programs in Indonesia.The research questions focus on the extent to which the lecturers: (a) feel dissatisfied with the way they taught in the past; (b) think that they have the skills to use the new instructional method (NIM); (c) perceive that lecturers, administrators, and advisory personnel involved are committed to change; (d) perceive that learning resources required to implement the NIM are available; (e) believe that they have sufficient time to implement the NIM; (f) perceive that rewards are available for their efforts to implement the NIM; (g) perceive the presence of leadership; and (h) perceive the presence of participation of lecturers, administrators, and advisory personnel in the implementation of the NIM.A survey was conducted of university lecturers who had participated in a Course Reconstruction Workshop (Applied Approach training). The sample population came from three universities in Java and three universities from different islands outside of Java.A two-way table of statistical data analysis was employed to analyze the data collected. Comparisons were made between: (a) the percentage of lecturers who perceived the presence of the conditions that facilitated the implementation of the NIM and those who did not; and (b) the percentage of lecturers who implemented the NIM partially and those who implemented the NIM almost completely or completely. The influence of the conditions that facilitated implementation was also analyzed.Findings. (a) the eight conditions that facilitated implementation were present in varying degrees; (b) all of the lecturers implemented the NIM in their teaching either partially or almost completely/completely; (c) the more strongly the eight conditions were present at a university, the higher the percentage of lecturers who implemented the NIM almost completely or completely; and (d) demographic differences are probably not appropriate criteria for selecting the Course Reconstruction Workshop participants. Lecturers with different characteristics showed only small differences in perceiving the presence or absence of conditions that facilitated the implementation of NIM.
