$ABSTRACT:
While many different purposes may be cited, it is generally agreed upon that two basic objectives should be served when formally evaluating teachers: one being accountability and the other professional development (Duke, 1990A; McLaughlin & Pfeifer, 1988). However, there is agreement among scholars and practitioners that most evaluation systems serve neither of these objectives well. Also, there is debate as to whether or not both purposes can exist within the same system.A cross-sectional survey investigating teacher evaluation procedure and policy was administered to the faculties of 18 randomly selected schools in New York State. The responses of 447 K-12 public school teachers were gathered to examine various interrelated factors (like supervisory skills, procedures employed, criteria used, teacher characteristics and active involvement of teachers in their own evaluations) thought to influence the effectiveness of teacher evaluation (Darling-Hammond, 1990; Duke, 1995; McLaughlin & Pfeifer, 1988). Cronbachs Alpha was used to develop the scales and Pearson Correlations and multiple regression were utilized to analyze associations between dimensions.The data indicate associations between (a) interrelated factors, like supervisory behaviors. procedures, etc., thought to contribute to effective teacher evaluation and both measures of perceived teacher evaluation effectiveness; (b) teachers' reports of their supervisors' behaviors and active teacher involvement in their own evaluations; (c) teachers' reports of their active involvement in their own evaluations and their perceptions of evaluation effectiveness; and (d) teacher accountability for their teaching and student's learning and teacher professional development.The results of this study contributes to a better understanding of an effective teacher evaluation policy and process from the perspective of the teacher. The study also provides the opportunity to explore additional ingredients of effective teacher evaluations, such as the multidimensional concept of trust, which is desired as a result of our dependency on the services of other people (Butter, 199 1, Swan, Trawick, Rink & Roberts, 1988).
