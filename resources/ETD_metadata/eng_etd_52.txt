$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation will examine the basis of personal identity in three major American writers, Jonathan Edwards, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Alfred North Whitehead. Each of these men was known for his unique approach to life and the universe; each was a leader and a force to be contended with in his age. We will inquire what type of identity the interpretation of the universe by each man allows the individual.
