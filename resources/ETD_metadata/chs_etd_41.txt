$ABSTRACT:
The efficacy of two outpatient drug free treatment programs in reducing or eliminating substance abuse was examined. The sample consisted of twenty individuals in each of the two participating programs who were interviewed at treatment admission, and again, following three months of outpatient substance abuse treatment. Survey data were collected through the use of the Addiction Severity Index (McClellan, et al., 1980) which covers such assessment areas as medical status, employment status, drug/alcohol use, legal status, family relationships and psychiatric status. The overall findings suggest that outpatient drug free substance abuse treatment is successful in reducing or eliminating substance use. Clients in both groups improved significantly (.05 level) in the areas of alcohol and drug use, and had improved functioning in many important life areas such as employment and family/social relationships
