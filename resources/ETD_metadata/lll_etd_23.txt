$DEPARTMENT:

$KEYWORDS:
Louis Zukofsky, poetry, objectification

$ABSTRACT:
This study proceeds as a series of inter-related inquiries extending out from (and concluding with) the question: what does it mean to say a poem is an object? These inquiries are organized through an analysis of sincerity and objectification, the major terms of objectivist poetics as derived from the writings of Louis Zukofsky.
