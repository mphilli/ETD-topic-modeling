Several factors have contributed to the recent interest in this species. About five years ago, Tumblebrook Farms (Brandt Lake, New York) inbred a strain of gerbils, initially for the study of certain diseases to which the gerbil is susceptible (Schwenkter, 1963). However, the ease with which gerbils can be handled and maintained has made them the attractive species for many types of experimental investigations. In addition, there has been some recent emphasis on the importance of species as a variable in psychological and behavioral research (Lockard, 1968). The work of many ethologists and comparative psychologists has amply demonstrated the dangers of studying a single species when one wishes to generalize the results to all animals (Beach, 1950; Lockard, 1968). ...
