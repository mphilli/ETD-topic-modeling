The reaction of triphenylphosphine dihalides with alcohols

$DEPARTMENT:
Chemistry

$KEYWORDS:
organic chemistry, triphenylphosphine dihalides

$ABSTRACT:
Alkyl and aryl halides are important building blocks in organic synthesis.  they are useful in alkylation reactions--Grignard and Friedel-Crafts reactions, in coupling processes - Wurtz and Wurtz-Fittig reactions, in condensations - Reformatsky reactions, as well as in the preparation of esters and mixed ether...
