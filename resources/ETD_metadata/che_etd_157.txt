$TITLE:
A Study on the Synthesis of Fluorine-Containing Gamma-Aminoalcohols and Beta-Aminoketones

$DEPARTMENT:
Chemistry

$KEYWORDS:
Fluorine-containing gamma-aminoalcohols, Behavior, Mannich reaction

$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of the investigation reported here was to find a synthesis route for the preparation of fluorine-containing gamma-aminoalcohols of the general structure CF3CH(OH)CH2CH2NR2 and to study the behavior of a number of partially fluorinated carbonyl compounds in the Mannich reaction.
