$ABSTRACT:
The analysis of chiral materials has been an important subject in computational electromagnetics. In this dissertation, the method of moments technique is used to solve the problem of transmission through an arbitrarily shaped aperture separating air and a chiral medium. The aperture is in an infinite ground plane. Excitation is assumed to be a plane wave. The equivalence principle is used to replace the aperture with a conducting surface with an equivalent magnetic current on each side of it. By enforcing the continuity of the tangential components of the total electric and magnetic fields across the aperture, an integral equation is obtained. The aperture has been modeled by triangular patches. The equivalent magnetic currents are approximated by linear combinations of expansion functions. The mixed potential formulation for a homogeneous chiral medium is developed and used to obtain the electric and the magnetic fields produced by these expansion functions. The coefficients of these expansion functions are obtained using the method of moments. Numerical results are presented for different shapes of the aperture.
