$ABSTRACT:
The ghost town of Bodie, high in the desert of Eastern California, was once a thriving gold-mining town. Today, its ramshackle buildings, preserved in a state of "arrested decay," make it a popular tourist destination. In Bodie's powerfully suggestive landscape, visitors and staff alike experience the mythic West. This ethnographic study looks at how Bodie's landscape communicates narratives of progress from a primitive past, and how these narratives are a lived part of American social memory in this ghost town. Specifically the work examines how the concept of authenticity is communicated Bodie's landscape: both through presence and powerfully also through absence, and how the concept of authenticity enables Bodie's master narratives. The work also examines the methodological problems that when the researcher studies a community of which she is part.
