$DEPARTMENT:
Earth Sciences

$KEYWORDS:
40Ar/49Ar, argon, diffusion, fission-track, lunar, neon

$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is subdivided into three independent chapters on low temperature thermochronology. In chapter one a new methodology is presented for dating zircon using the fission-track technique. Chapters two and three describe experiments and modeling to determine the diffusion kinetics of Ar and Ne in lunar impact glass.
