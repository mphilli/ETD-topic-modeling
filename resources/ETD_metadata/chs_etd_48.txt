$ABSTRACT:
This study explored the relationships between counseling students' past experiences with suicide and suicide intervention skill. Specific past experiences included personal thoughts of suicide, exposure to others' suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and exposure to suicide as a counselor or counselor in training. The amount and type of educational exposure to the topic of suicide that counseling students were exposed to was also explored, as were differences between master's and doctoral students counseling. Findings included significant relationships between both impact of client suicide attempt and client completed suicide, and suicide intervention skill. Trends related to suicide intervention skill are discussed, along with the study's strengths, limitations, and areas for future research in the area of counselor education and supervision.
