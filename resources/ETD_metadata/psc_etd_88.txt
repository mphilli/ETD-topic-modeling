$ABSTRACT:
Historical factors have suggested that Chinese-Thai relations within the borders of Thailand are more susceptible to amelioration than those in several other southeast Asian states. It is the purpose of this paper to examine those relations against their historical background and current history, with a view to uncovering their precise status, the implications of that status for contemporary Thailand, and some indications as to the course of their future development.
