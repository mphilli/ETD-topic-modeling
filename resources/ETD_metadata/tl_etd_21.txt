$ABSTRACT:
In a study of leadership skills at a large, comprehensive private university, a student's degree of involvement in campus activities and programs served as the most significant predictor of high scores on the Socially Responsible Leadership Scale Revised (SRLS-R). Within campus involvement, the degree to which a student participated in organized community service and as part of campus-registered student organizations explained most of the variance. Gender also served as a significant predictor. A student's class standing was also a predictor, but not when controlling for campus involvement. Race did not predict SRLS-R score. This study served as part of the Multi-Institutional Study of Leadership (MSL), a national study involving several diverse campuses to, in part, determine factors that affect a student's development of socially responsible leadership skills.
