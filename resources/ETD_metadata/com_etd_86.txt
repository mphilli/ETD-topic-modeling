$ABSTRACT:
The focus of this study is broadcast network news and how the  "big three" television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) responded to the Internet over  an eight-year period of time, 1997 to 2004. The study measures the networks'  coverage of the Internet as a news subject and their incorporation of companion  news websites into their respective nightly newscasts. Four Internet-related  variables: a) news stories per newscast containing an Internet reference; b)  Internet keywords; c) invitational references; and d) URL references were  identified and utilized to examine whether changes exist in network coverage: a)  over time; and b) relative to changes in the U.S. online population.      This study found that historical time was not a significant factor in  predicting the inclusion of Internet-related news stories and website references  in nightly newscasts. The U.S. online population also had no significant  influence on the inclusion of such news stories or Web references. Significant  differences were identified among the three networks' coverage of the Internet  and their inclusion of website references in nightly newscasts. The findings  from this study suggest a series of missed opportunities for the networks to  leverage the Internet during its formative years of 1997 to 2004 (as a news  subject and as an extension of the newscasts) to benefit the newscasts and their  audiences.      The Internet and in particular, network news websites, have not  received the same attention in gatekeeping and agenda-setting studies as have  traditional media. These online extensions of the newscasts warrant additional  study based on behaviors reflecting increased online news consumption among the  news audience.
