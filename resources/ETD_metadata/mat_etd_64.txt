$ABSTRACT:
This study attempts to answer the question, What is  the mathematical knowledge required by teachers of elementary mathematics  content courses in the area of multiplication and division of  fractions? Beginning in the mid-1980s, when Shulman (1986)  introduced the idea of pedagogical content knowledge, researchers have been  looking at the knowledge needed to teach in a variety of different content  areas. One area that has garnered much of the research is that of mathematics.  Researchers have developed frameworks for what they call mathematical knowledge  for teaching, but there has been little work done looking at the knowledge  requirements for teachers of teachers. This study attempts to fill this gap by  determining some aspects of a framework for the mathematical knowledge required  to teach prospective elementary teachers multiplication and division of  fractions.In order to determine aspects of a framework for mathematics  teacher educator knowledge in relation to multiplication and division of  fractions, I interviewed, observed, and audiotaped three experienced teacher  educators in different educational settings to determine the mathematical work  of teaching prospective teachers fraction multiplication and division. My  analysis focused on three of major tasks that came out of the work: introducing  fraction multiplication, helping students make sense of fraction division, and  assessing student understanding. Each of these tasks played a major role in the  work of the teacher educators, and the knowledge required to perform these tasks  was evident in varying degrees in each teacher educator.After analyzing the three mathematical tasks and the knowledge  required by them, I was able to determine some components of a framework for the  mathematical knowledge needed for teaching teachers multiplication and division  of fractions. These aspects include: understanding multiple representations of  fraction multiplication and division and how these representations relate to  each other, to whole number ideas, and to the algorithms, deciding which aspects  of the topics will help prospective teachers make the connections that they will  need in order to teach these topics, especially since time often plays a factor  in what gets taught in mathematics content classes for prospective teachers,  setting specific goals of exactly what one wants one's students to know, rather  than having a general goal of wanting prospective teachers to develop conceptual  understanding of a topic, and being able to design and use assessments  effectively to help decide if one is achieving one's goals.While each of the aspects described above are components of a  framework for the mathematical knowledge needed by teacher educators, the three  teacher educators in my study all lacked or were unable to demonstrate some of  the knowledge components that would have helped them to meet their goals,  despite having a wealth of experience teaching and designing mathematics content  courses for prospective elementary teachers. One possible reason for this is  that each of the teacher educators in my study were basically alone in their  departments, without opportunities to collaborate or discuss these ideas with  anyone else. These results suggest a need for better professional development  for teacher educators in the field of mathematics education.
