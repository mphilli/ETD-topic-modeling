$ABSTRACT:
This study discusses Yates' understanding of the art of memory. The study also gives a brief interpretive history of the appearance of the detective story in the works of Poe, Doyle, and Collins. Finally, the study articulates the correspondences between Yates' idea and detective fiction and argues for the ability of the rational to accommodate the imaginal, and the unique position shared by the art of memory and the detective story with respect to both.
