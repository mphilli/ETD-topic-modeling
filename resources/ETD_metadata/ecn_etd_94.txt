$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation employs hedonic analysis to examine market demand for three neighborhood disamenities. The first chapter investigates the property value impact of a No Child Left Behind "failing" school designation. The second chapter studies the property value impact of a local homicide. The third chapter examines the property value impact of proximity to a mosque post 9/11. Each disamenity has a negative and significant effect on property values with the magnitude of impact varying across household type.
