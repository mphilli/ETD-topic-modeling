$ABSTRACT:
An ethnographic account of North India, this dissertation examines the remembrance of the history of the kingdom of Bharatpur as a significant area for complex forms of caste-based identity articulation among the area's Jat population. Drawing upon the theoretical frameworks of Halbwachs and Bakhtin, this study examines how, in the postcolonial present, a variety of Bharatpur's Jat residents remembered aspects of this history and present an array of more inclusive, or centripetal, or more exclusive and oppositional, or centrifugal, identities which include those of region, caste, clan, and village.
