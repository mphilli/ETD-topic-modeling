$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation provides an analysis of Segundo Serrano Poncela's narrative work, texts that, rarely remembered today, are in need of an in-depth study. Short narratives and novels are studied to offer one of the most complete works about this author. The aim of this work is to provide an extensive analysis of his style, characters, subjects and themes, emphasizing the historical aspect of the exile in which the author tries to acquire a literary identity derived from the political past.The introductory chapter situates the figure of Serrano Poncela within the Narrative of Spanish Exile tradition. In reviewing the existing criticism, it points out the few valuable articles that recognize his literary worth.Chapter I offers a biographical account of the author's life, from his childhood, his participation in the Spanish Civil War and his life in exile in three different countries. Serrano Poncela was never able to return to his homeland and died in exile in Venezuela.Chapter II studies his short narratives from the beginning of the exile in 1940 until 1968 when the last collection of short stories was published.Chapter III analyzes his two major works published in the 60's, Habitacion para hombre solo and El hombre de la cruz verde. These two novels explore the nature of exile and the essence of Spain as a nation from two different autobiographical perspectives.Chapter IV deals exclusively with his major work of fiction La vina de Nabot, a posthumous publication. This work closes a trajectory of his narrative technique by returning to the cause of the exile: the Spanish Civil War.This dissertation also incorporates many primary sources extracted from the correspondence of the author with prominent figures of the Spanish literary world such as Max Aub, Francisco Ayala, Jose Ferrater Mora, etc. It also includes unpublished short stories and manuscripts and the most complete bibliography of the author to date.The study shows the author's need to claim for himself a literary identity as an author of fiction, and his desire that his work be the testimony of his past and presence within contemporary Spanish Narrative.
