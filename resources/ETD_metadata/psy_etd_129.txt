$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to determine whether physical or psychological abuse from the point of view of either abusers and/or victims in dating relationships is related to elevated scores on scales of love. A positive relationship between abuse and scores on love scales is believed to be evidence of traumatic bonding (Dutton & Painter, 1983). Two hundred and twenty-four university students participated in this study. The participants completed the Conflict Tactics Scale (Strauss, 1979), the Psychological Maltreatment Inventory (Kasian & Painter, 1992), the Sternberg Triangular Love Scale (Sternberg, 1987), the Love Attitudes Scale (Hendrick & Hendrick, 1986), the Adult Attachment Type Inventory (Hazan & Shaver, 1987), and a survey of demographic information. Verbal abusers obtained statistically significantly higher scores on Passion, F(2, 201) = 5.03, p =.007, and Erotic love, F(2, 201) = 5.80, p =.004 than did nonabusers. Abusers who isolated and emotionally controlled their partners obtained statistically significantly higher scores on Ludic love, F(1, 212) = 10.80, p =.001, and Manic love, F(1, 212) = 9.19, p =.003 than did nonabusers. Victims who were isolated and emotionally controlled by their partners obtained higher scores on Intimacy, F(1, 212) = 8.55, p =.004; Passion, F(1, 212) = 12.53, p =.000; Commitment, F(1, 212) = 6.95, p =.009; Erotic love, F(1, 212) = 7.54, p =.007; and Agapic love, F(1, 212) = 16.10, p =.000 than did nonvictims. Abusers who perpetrated acts of jealousy obtained higher scores in Passion, F(1, 212) = 7.34, p =.007; Erotic love, F(1, 212) = 7.23, p =.008; and Manic love, F(1, 212) = 8.86, p =.003 than did nonabusers. Among the female participants who described their attachment style as avoidant, there was a higher incidence than expected of females who attacked their partner's self-esteem and a lower incidence than expected of females who did not attack their partner's self-esteem. Among the female participants who described their attachment style as secure, there was a lower incidence than expected of females who attacked their partner's self-esteem and a higher incidence than expected of females who did not attack their partner's self-esteem, $\chi\sp2$(2, N = 158) = 13.36, $p < .001.$ Traumatic bonding occurred more consistently for abusers than for victims.
