$ABSTRACT:
Major life changes, particularly the diagnosis of genomic disorders,  impact the entire family unit. In this study, I explore how families and  individuals experience and give meaning to a diagnosis of Friedreich's  Ataxia, (FRDA) a neurological, hereditary, incurable disease. Thirteen  individuals 16 or older living with a diagnosis of FRDA participated in a  face-to-face interview. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was  used to process and analyze the data. The analysis suggested that  families living with FRDA become very resilient, flexible and adaptable  to the challenges and losses associated with the illness. The families I  interviewed focused on the present and believed the illness made them  value life more. Results indicated that the diagnosis affects the roles  and family dynamics. Additionally, the families focused on the disease,  the ill member, and the impending death of the diagnosed.
