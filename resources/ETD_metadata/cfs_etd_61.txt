$ABSTRACT:
This exploratory study examined mothers' experiences and  satisfaction with childcare selection. The self-selected group of mothers from  30 different childcare settings in three Midwestern states participated in the  study. Similarities and differences with mothers' experiences when selecting  childcare were analyzed by three household status groups: 110 (Group One)  employed mothers married to or partnered with another employed adult in the  household, 61 (Group Two) employed mothers living with no other adults in  single-income households, and 26 (Group Three) employed mothers living in  single-income households with one or more unemployed adults. A majority of  mothers in each household group reported using licensed care settings regardless  of household income, mothers' educational level, or having reported a greater  number of problems when seeking childcare. The highest level of education for  most single mothers was a high school diploma or GED compared with a college  degree reported by most mothers in multiple-income households. Most mothers in  each household group reported learning of their care setting via word-of-mouth,  and of family being their most important source for learning of early childhood  information. Single-income household groups with unemployed adults reported the  highest number of children in care, the youngest children in care, and a greater  number of males than either of the other two household groups. Mothers in  single-income households reported a higher percentage of "Feisty" temperaments  for children in care than did mothers in multiple-income households. Household  income was not significantly related to mothers' primary and secondary choices  of care when quality of care was rated as low, medium, or high in accordance  with National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)  standards.
