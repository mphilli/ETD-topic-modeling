$ABSTRACT:
In recent decades,  the state of American families has dominated public discourse as a  subject of concern and often rancorous debate across academic,  political, religious, and social welfare communities. As patriarchal  authority, economic production, and the transfer of land and property  have waned as material incentives for kinship solidarity, questions  arise concerning what emotional and psychological "glue" remains to bind  family members to one another across geographic and generational  distances in postmodern times. As contemporary patterns of divorce,  remarriage, single-parenthood, and cohabitation complicate traditional  definitions of "family", people are obliged to fashion new meanings to  make sense of the changing familial terrain. As these new meanings begin  to shape the choices and life arrangements of new generations of  Americans, social scientists concerned with the future of families may  be well advised to focus attention on the specific ways in which  ethnicity, social class, and rapid social change may interact to  maintain, attenuate, or strengthen solidarity among siblings, parents  and children, and extended-family relatives.The  present study addressed these issues from within the situated context  of a single large, Italian-American family. Employing an ethnographic  approach influenced by concepts from grounded theory, social  organization, and ethnomethodology, the study investigated the  practices, perceptions, and shared meanings that constitute the "family  ties" of the DiVoli family and their relatives in a small Northeastern  American town. Using a combination of participant-observation and  semi-structured interviews, I draw from my unique standpoint as the  partner of a DiVoli family member to develop an emergent understanding  of what "family ties" mean to the DiVolis and their relatives, how those  ties have been maintained over time, and how they shape both the  socially organized practices of the family and the individual lives of  family members."Family ties" emerged from  the data as structural and interactional phenomena producing patterns  of behavior persisting over time, while continually adapting to  environmental contingencies. Three varieties were identified: ties of  shared experience, attachment, and obligation, all of which appeared to  exert a centripetal attraction, drawing family members into closer  relationship, in response to centrifugal social forces such as career  mobility and individualistic cultural trends.
