$ABSTRACT:
This study attempts to present Jonathan Edwards as a pioneer social psychologist and social theorist whose ideas still have relevance for a time as troubled as was his own. This paper focuses upon his conception of individual and social renewal as complementary psychological processes: dynamic in nature and evolutionary in character. These processes are initiated by faith in the reality of the truly Christian society, and are sustained by the practice of conscious, intelligent transcendence of what is, in order to realize what ought to be.--Preface.
