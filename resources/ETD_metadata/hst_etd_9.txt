$ABSTRACT:
The subject of the Parliaments of France, so far as I am aware, is  treated by no one English author. While frequent allusions are made  to the Parliaments in all histories of France, somewhat diligent search  has failed to find in any English work an adequate explanation of their  origin, their organization, and their political history. The collection of  materials for even so short a thesis, has therefore been attended with  considerable difficulty. The translations of the authorities quoted in the  notes, are, in all cases, those of the writer.
