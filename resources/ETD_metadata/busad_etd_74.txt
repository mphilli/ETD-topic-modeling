$DEPARTMENT:

$KEYWORDS:
Marketing, Geriatrics

$ABSTRACT:
Growing in absolute numbers, the elderly represent an increasingly prominent sector of our contemporary society. Yet, despite this continued growth, the marketing community, to date, has not effectively responded to the needs and requirements of the older consumer. In this context, this study will attempt to investigate the composition of the elderly consumer market. Psychographics (opinions, attitudes, interests and beliefs) will form the principal segmentation mechanism.
