$ABSTRACT:
This paper is intended to show how the feelings and thoughts of the Polish population, to whom free expression of their sentiments was partially denied, found their outlet in the Polish novel in the post-war period, and how changing literary themes, characters, and conflicts reflected the altered ways of living and thinking. It is also hoped to convey a sense of  the precarious state of affairs between the things that have been accepted and those that are still bitterly opposed.--Page 2.
