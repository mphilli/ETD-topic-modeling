$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to examine the concept "feebleminded female" as it was use by the professionals in an institution for the mentally retarded at the turn of the century. ...It will become evident rather quickly that the concept was to a large extent a social construct, in the same way that people have thought about mental health, crime, sex roles and mental retardation.
