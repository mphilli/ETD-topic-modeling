$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this paper is to describe the story of the French-English struggle at Oswego, in New York Province, from the time the English constructed the first fortified post in 1927, until the French lost the struggle with the fall of Montreal in 1760. The study includes a brief resume of the events which led up to the English building at Oswego, and takes into account not only the military struggle between England and France, and Oswego's part in it, but also the parallel struggle over the fur trade and for the loyalty of the Indians. It deals indirectly with the long political conflict in New York Province where that conflict had a relationship to overall French-English struggle.
