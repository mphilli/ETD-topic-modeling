$ABSTRACT:
Sport video gamers, as a huge population, have been studied descriptively in terms of the demographic and motivation for playing. Yet most studies paid attention to the relationship between gamers and the video game. A gap remains between sport video gaming and its effects on gamers’ attitude toward the exact sport they are playing in the game. Through the Elaboration Likelihood Model lens, the current study aimed to examine the effects of sport video gaming on gamers’ confidence in the sport as well as desire to play the sport. A pretest-posttest experimental design was conducted to investigate the causality between gaming and confidence and desire change. As the first application of ELM to sport video game, the current study incorporated the classic route shift pattern in persuasion to predict the improvement of gamers’ confidence and desire after game playing. This study proved that sport video gaming is effective in improving gamers’ attitude and behavior toward the specific sport. Specifically, this study justified that the time of playing, the performance in game, and the immersive degree of the game are influential to the improvement of gamers’ confidence in their ability and knowledge in golf as well as their desire to play golf in real life.
