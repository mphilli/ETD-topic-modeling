The massive growth that took place in nearly every aspect of Russo-German relations between 1850 and 1914 occured in spote of a bittler political-economic confrontation between 1887 and 1894 and a new deterioration in political relations after 1906 ...Among the conclusions of this study is that the Russian and German economies were basically complementary and that the bilateral economic relations accordingly developed becasue each was able to provide the other with that which it most required.
