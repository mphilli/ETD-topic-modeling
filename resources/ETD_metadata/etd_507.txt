$ABSTRACT:
Although parental inductive discipline has significant influence in children’s prosocial behavior, there is less understanding of how parental emotion regulation strategies influence inductive discipline. This study examined the role of two parental emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) on parental inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior. I tested the hypotheses that parental cognitive reappraisal positively correlates with inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior whereas parental expressive suppression negatively correlates with inductive discipline in a sample of 59 parents of 3-to-5 year old children. I performed correlation and regression analyses to examine these relationships. Results indicated that expressive suppression was negatively associated with children’s prosocial behavior. In addition, the relationship between inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior was stronger when parental warmth was high. These findings provide empirical evidence for the influence of parental emotion regulation strategies on parenting behaviors and child outcome.
