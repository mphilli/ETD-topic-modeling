$ABSTRACT:
The existence of certain classes of combinatorial configurations has been in doubt for decades. With the advent of the modern computer, a small number of these configurations have been constructed using exhaustive search techniques. Even with the major advances in computer technology, only a new more cases could be solved using traditional methods. In this paper, a new approach to the construction of these configurations using nonenumerative search techniques is introduced.
