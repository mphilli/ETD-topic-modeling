$ABSTRACT:
Regularization of quantum field theories (QFT's) can be achieved by quantizing the underlying manifold (spacetime or spatial slice) thereby replacing it by a non-commutative matrix model or a "fuzzy manifold'. Such discretization by quantization is remarkably successful in preserving symmetries and topological features, and altogether overcoming the fermion-doubling problem. In this thesis, the fuzzification of coadjoint orbits and their QFT's are put forward.
