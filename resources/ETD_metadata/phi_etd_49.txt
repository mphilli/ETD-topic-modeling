$ABSTRACT:
"Judgements of social justice do presuppose principles which in some sense transcend both the feelings of the speaker and the institutions of human society."This statement by one of America's leading contemporary ethicists first raised in my mind the question as to the meaning and significance of transcendence for a social ethic, but I did not, at the time, realize the complexity nor the direction that a study of this question would reveal (though Frankena no doubt did in light of the more than ambiguous phrase "in some sense transcend"). This question then as to the meaning and significance of a concept of "transcendence" for social ethical theory was the original motivation for this investigation that has resulted in this dissertation.
