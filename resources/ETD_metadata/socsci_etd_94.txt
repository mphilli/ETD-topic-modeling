$ABSTRACT:
This project developed out of reflection on the increasing statistics and the limited information and attention given to African American women living with HIV/AIDS. The intent of the research was to fully explore the experience of African American women living with HIV/AIDS; to illuminate any coping strategies that are common among the women; and, to provide an understanding of any sources of strength that are drawn upon in response to the demands of this disease.The qualitative research method of in-depth interviewing was utilized for this project with nine (9) African American women living with HIV/AIDS over the course of a year. The interviews were unstructured, in an effort to gain rapport and to give the women an opportunity to articulate exactly how they experienced living with HIV/AIDS, without prompting. The conceptual paradigm of symbolic interactionism and grounded theory methods were employed to analyze the content of the interviews.Receiving the news of HIV/AIDS diagnosis sent each of the women interviewed into a process of reconciliation with the disease, themselves, and life itself. This process included basic physical and mental adjustments required for them to incorporate the changes the disease dictated; a psychological/emotional transition from care giver to care receiver; the conversion of shame, associated with the stigma of HIV/AIDS, into dignity, accomplished through the tradition of sharing their knowledge with other women; and a transformation in self perception from that of dying to living with HIV/AIDS. This study documents sources of strength employed while these women moved through this process.
