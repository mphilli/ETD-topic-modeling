$TITLE:
Investigation Of The Diffusion Of A Scalar In Turbulent Shear Flow

$DEPARTMENT:
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

$KEYWORDS:
Mechanics, mass diffusion, passive scalar

$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism of turbulent diffusion of temperature in a shear flow. The temperature which is diffused in this case is a scalar. There are particular challenges in addressing mass diffusion.--Introduction.
