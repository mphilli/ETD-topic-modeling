$ABSTRACT:
The subject of this dissertation evolved out of an original interest in intra-urban migration. Attempts at modeling intra-urban migration patterns led to the identification of neighborhoods in the city that seem to remain stable while other parts of the city experience high turnover rates. A search for reasons why such stability occurs led to explorations into racial and class differences as they relate to residential choice and preference. This dilettantish route led almost full-circle back to intra-urban migration, though now more narrowly focused on questions about ethnicity and the role of assimilation in the dispersal of ethnic residential enclaves. As I began to research this new focus, it struck me that, despite popular belief, ethnic groups seemed to be very much in evidence in urban America today; that assimilation theory contains clear geographic implications for changing residential patterns; and that there are few studies that deal with these implications.
