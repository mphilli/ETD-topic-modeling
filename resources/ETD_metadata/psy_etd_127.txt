$ABSTRACT:
William Glasser's Schools Without Failure approaches to problems facing schools today, notably the school's overemphasis on failure as a motivating device, stems from the development of his work as a private and consulting psychiatrist. ... Glasser's program to reduce school failure is a total psycho-educational statement regarding what he perceives as "faulty education," and effects such traditional educative techniques as punishment, non-promotion, testing, homework, and student classification. Most central to Glasser's ideas for evolving schools without failure is his emphasis on classroom meetings, in which the teacher-led class group becomes a counseling group where time is spent developing the social responsibility necessary to solve behavioral and educational problems.
