$ABSTRACT:
This paper will be devoted primarily to an examination of the role of the State Government in California, Michigan, and New York in aiding the development of metropolitan areas within their boundaries, and encouraging a workable framework for the solution of metropolitan problems. In a broad sense, there will be concern not only with financial or legal assistance to metropolitan areas, but also with the encouragement or hindrance of a feeling of “metropolitanism” within these regions.
