$ABSTRACT:
This qualitative analysis examines audience engagement with  fictional portrayals of mother-daughter relationships in prime-time television  of the 21st century. I used in-depth interviews with women of different  backgrounds to explore how real mothers and daughters interpret portrayals of  mother-daughter relationships on television; how they make sense of their own  mother-daughter relationships through their engagement with these portrayals;  and how and to what extent their engagement with these portrayals influences  their own lives and mother-daughter relationships.The results of this study uncovered a process of audience  engagement with mother-daughter relationships on television that involved the  viewing experience, interpretation, sensemaking, and perceived effects on the  participants' real lives and relationships. Throughout this process, female  viewers of various backgrounds tended to evaluate the mother-daughter  relationships on television using their own relationships as a standard;  evaluate their own relationships using the TV relationships as a standard; and  ultimately validate the value of their own mother-daughter relationships. As a  fourth step in the process, those viewers who were most involved with and  identified most strongly with the TV characters also acknowledged effects that  their engagement with the shows has had on their lives and relationships. This  study demonstrates the importance of studying women's engagement with  mother-daughter relationships in media texts and further develops the literature  on mother-daughter relationships in fields such as psychology, sociology,  women's studies and family studies by bringing popular culture into the  discussion.
