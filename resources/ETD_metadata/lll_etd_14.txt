$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is a semiotic analysis of double character in six of Rosario Ferre's short stories. In this study, I considered these literary characters as language emblems. The language, as double characters are structures conformed by binary oppositions. Using the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic relations that occurred in the linguistic system, I analyze the different paradigms that conform those dual entities and their combination relations.The doll, the golem, the artistic character, and the social opposite are the different paradigms described in the dissertation. Metamorphosis, transformative symbiosis, and specular interactions are some examples of the syntagmatic relations that occurred between the entities of the dual construction in Ferre's short stories.The last chapter examines the hermeneutic meaning of the literary double within a philosophic and semiotic framework. Understanding the double, from an hermeneutic perspective, leads us to gain knowledge of a mode of being; that which is being the same and different at the same time. By using models developed by Todorov, Baktin, Buber, and Kristeva I elucidate the different forms of alterity that appear in Ferre's double characters.
