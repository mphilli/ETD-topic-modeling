$ABSTRACT:
This is a study in a social history with an urban setting. The work concerns the history of the Irish-Americans in Syracuse, describing immigration, Catholicism, politics, socio-economic status and mobility, and Irish Nationalism. Because the study seemed to require a multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary approach, not only the more traditional historical methods were employed but also methods from other social sciences â€“ including sociology and political science. Thus, the socio-economic status and mobility of the Syracuse Irish is measured for certain years, as is their voting behavior and the influence of religion and ethnicity on their politics in general. Insofar as these portions of the study reflect quantification, the methods are in the realm of simple statistics, readily understandable by any reader.
