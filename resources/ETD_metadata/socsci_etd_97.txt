$ABSTRACT:
The regional and international dimensions of the Cypress conflict, the deep-seated tensions that gave rise to the crisis in 1963, the duration of the dispute, the intractability of the parties involved, and the presence of the United Nations in this continuing situation add up to a subject that warrants a study that evaluates the significance of the politics and the consequences of United Nations peacekeeping in Cypress.  How will we approach the evaluation of eight years of UN peacekeeping in Cypress?
