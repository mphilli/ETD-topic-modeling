$ABSTRACT:
The radical vision experienced by John Humphrey Noyes was a vision of human possibility. It was a vision of sinless men and women living in a righteous community, where the essence of sin, as selfishness, could be purged from the full range of personal and community relationships. While certainly he was a man with startling powers of imagination, he was, at the same time, a practical man, a pragmatist of the first order, who not only could imagine how things might be, but how, in infinite detail, it might be possible to make them that way. In this combination of ability and imagination he was a radical Utopian thinker.
