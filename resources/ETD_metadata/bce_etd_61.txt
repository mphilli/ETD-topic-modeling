$ABSTRACT:
Reduction of heat transfer from hot fluid  layers to solid surfaces has become a very important and challenging  problem. Thermally resistant materials for turbine blades, exhaust  nozzles, combustion chamber walls, high-speed aircraft, re-entry  vehicles, etc. may be developed only within certain limits; beyond these  a means must be found for maintaining tolerable surface temperatures by  reducing heat transfer. Most of the methods proposed for this purpose  involve the transfer of mass from or through the solid surface, or mass  transfer from a liquid film covering the solid surface. A considerable  body of literature treating the problem of simultaneous heat and mass  transfer has arisen, and what is felt to be a representative selection  of papers is reported throughout this study.    To date interest has  centered primarily upon single component boundary layers. However, it is  likely that the mass transfer systems mentioned above will be  multicomponent in nature. As a result there remains a number of effects  to be discussed in detail, among these being property variation with  concentration, thermodynamic coupling, and the effect of body forces  acting on non-uniform density distributions caused by both temperature  and concentration fields. The present study was initiated to investigate  these effects for a number of binary gaseous systems, with air being  the ambient gas in each case.
