$ABSTRACT:
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and predictive qualities of a brand loyalty model for frequently purchased goods, i.e. groceries, house- and personal-care products, that defines loyalty as multi-brand rather than ini-brand. The new methodological concept advanced here is "assortment stability," which, as many other revolutionary ideas in marketing theory was first expoused by Alderson (1965, p. 38). -- from preface.Contents: I.
