An Investigation Into The Influence Of Ramistic Rhetoric On The Rhetorical Expression Of Shakespeare's Comic Heroines

$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to examine Shakespeare's use of rhetoric in his depiction of comedic heroines. I intend to argue that the form of rhetorical expression exhibited by the women in the comedies is derived from the Elizabethan convention of the boy actor. This convention, I maintain, resulted in Shakespeare's dependence on certain figures of rhetoric -- all of which were outlined by Peter Ramus and depicted in The Arcadian Rhetorike (1588) of Abraham Fraunce.
