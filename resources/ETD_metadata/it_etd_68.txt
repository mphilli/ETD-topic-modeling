$ABSTRACT:
Examining the cases of Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) and  the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), this dissertation uses  principal-agent delegation theory and social network analysis to explain how  United States government (USG) agencies influence efforts to secure critical  Internet resources.Consistent with a logic of delegation and the prominent role of  individuals in Internet governance, USG agencies participated directly and  indirectly in the social networks formed around Internet governance  institutions. Its participation occurred by delegating responsibility to  organizational agents that participated in the DNSSEC and RPKI standardization  and policy processes. By doing so, agencies leveraged these individuals'  expertise, and in the case of DNSSEC were more successful than expected at  achieving adoption of standards and policies consistent with their political and  economic interests. However, this ex ante approach  of influencing standards and policy outcomes in open and transparent Internet  governance institutions has limits. Agencies also relied on an ex  post institutional control (specifically a contract with an  Internet governance institution) to ensure outcomes related to securing and  maintaining oversight of critical Internet resources.These results are important and timely to researchers and policy  makers. They contribute to the growing academic field of Internet governance,  integrating well known theory from political science and standardization. Given  current debate on the appropriate role for governments in Internet governance  and securing the Internet, the cases illustrate how governments can be  productive contributors as peers in relatively transparent and open Internet  governance processes. This stands in contrast to governments' perceived need for  a greater oversight role in managing and securing critical Internet resources.  The results also suggest that efforts to improve the governance and security of  critical Internet resources should pay closer scrutiny to extant contractual  relationships between Internet governance institutions and powerful governments,  notably the United States, as similar ex post interventions enabled by them  could undermine the delegation strategy.
