$ABSTRACT:
For the Catholic Church, the major religious event off the twentieth century was the Second Vatican Council and the momentous changes in theology and practice which the council's decrees initiated.  For the Catholic diocesan press in the UNited States, the Vatican Council brought about a change in the theory of the diocesan press no less significant that the evolution of freedom of the press from governmental control which occurred in seventeenth century England.
