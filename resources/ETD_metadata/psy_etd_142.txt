$ABSTRACT:
As a group, children with language impairments are at-risk for experiencing later reading difficulties. One explanation that has been offered for these difficulties is their poor phonological awareness skills. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of teaching phonological awareness skills to young children with language impairments. Seventeen children between the ages of 5 to 7 years with language impairments participated in this study. Nine of the children participated in a nine week training program for facilitating phonological awareness (adapted from Blachman, Ball, Black & Tangel, 1994), and the other eight were in a language activities control group. The results of this study, although preliminary due to the small sample size, suggest that some children with language impairments can be trained in phonological awareness, and that such training appears to have beneficial effects for some children on not only phoneme segmentation and blending skills, but also students' word identification and developmental spelling skills.
