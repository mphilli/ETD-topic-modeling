$ABSTRACT:
Child abuse has long been a problem for society. However, only in the past 15 years has its pervasive and tremendous impact on American families been understood. Although there has been mounting concern for the perpetrators and victims of child abuse there is little empirical evidence to serve as a basis for prescribing psychotherapy for this population. The present study attempted to teach abusive parents a self-control skill using a structured learning approach. In addition, an attempt was made to enhance the transfer of therapeutic gains to new situations by manipulating the attribution of mastery and having participating parents prepare to play a helper role. The relationship between skill acquisition, transfer, and individual difference variables such as impulse-reflectivity, locus of control, and conceptual level was also explored.
