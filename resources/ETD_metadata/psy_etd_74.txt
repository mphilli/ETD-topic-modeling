$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of two strategies employed by a consultant to increase the integrity with which teachers implemented a reading intervention. The first strategy, performance feedback, included showing teachers a graph of their percent integrity as well as a graph of student reading progress. The second strategy, social support, entailed giving the teachers the opportunity to discuss issues in the classroom separate from the target student. Three teachers and a student in each of their classes served as participants. Teachers were trained by a consultant to implement a listening passage preview/repeated reading intervention three times per week. The strategies were compared using a counterbalanced ABCACB design. Results showed increases in mean levels of integrity with performance feedback. Social support produced more variable results, but appeared promising as a means of maintaining high levels of integrity. All three students showed increases in reading performance.
