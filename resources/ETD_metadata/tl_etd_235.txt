$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of  implementing Life Space Crisis Intervention as a school-wide strategy for  reducing school violence.Life Space Crisis Intervention (LSCI) is a strength-based verbal  interaction strategy (Long, Fecser, Wood, 2001). LSCI utilizes naturally  occurring crisis situations as teachable momentsThe literature review analyzes school violence, violence  prevention programs and effective change practices.This study employed mixed research methods with a sample  population of public school, LSCI trained, staff members in Central New  York.The result of this study supports two conclusions: LSCI is an  effective school-wide strategy, but was not implemented effectively or that LSCI  is effective as part of a school-wide violence prevention continuum. Further  research is warranted.
