$ABSTRACT:
This work is an analysis of Moses Mendelssohn's contributions to  aesthetic rationalism, a tradition that arose in 18-century Germany.  Rationalists held that aesthetic experience is primarily explained by the  perfection of the object being considered, where perfection is a fundamental,  rational (law-governed) property. As this work shows, Mendelssohn was among the  first to acknowledge and effectively address several significant objections to  the rationalist theory: its seeming inability to account for pleasure generally,  tragedy and tragic pleasure more specifically, and the sublime; and its apparent  blindness to the claims of genius and Rousseau's ethical critique of the arts.  Many commentators have claimed that Mendelssohn saw these issues as reasons to  move away from aesthetic rationalism, but Mendelssohn in fact attempted to  address each of them from within the rationalist framework. Mendelssohn's  resulting elaboration and defense of the rationalist tradition illustrates its  resilience and lasting relevance.
