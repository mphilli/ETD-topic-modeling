$ABSTRACT:
The present study examined the associations between parenting styles and adolescents’ academic performance, with a specific focus on examining the mediating role of activation control among Chinese adolescents. A framework of Chinese parenting style, which consists of three dimensions, rejection, emotional warmth, and over-protection, was utilized to predict activation control and academic outcomes. Structural models were fitted with the data collected from a Chinese sample of adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. Parenting styles were found to be associated with children’s activation control skills and academic outcomes. Activation control skills were found to be beneficial for promoting educational attainment expectation and reducing school work difficulties. The present study also indicates that in some cases activation control mediates the association between parental over-protection and experiencing school work difficulties. The findings of the present study reinforce previous research by demonstrating the importance of Chinese-specific parenting approaches and by identifying the importance of activation control in the Chinese cultural context.
