$ABSTRACT:
Using data taken with the CLEO II detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), we have searched for the effective Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) decays $b\to sl\sp+l\sp-$ in an inclusive way. We obtain upper limits on the branching ratio ${\cal B}(b\to se\sp+e\sp-)<5.7\times10\sp{-5},\ {\cal B}(b\to s\mu\sp+\mu\sp-)<5.6\times10\sp{-5}$ and ${\cal B}(b\to se\sp{\pm}\mu\sp{\mp})<2.2\times10\sp{-5}$ at 90% C.L.
