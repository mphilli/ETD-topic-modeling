$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is an attempt to study the relationship of the Russian expression of literary utopia to the voluminous Western expression of the same idea, focusing on the following Russian utopian works of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries: the major eighteenth-century utopia “Puteshestvie v Zemlju Ofirskuju” written by Mixail Shcherbatov during the years 1783-1784 but not published until 1896; and the following nineteenth-century utopias:  “Son”(1819) by Aleksandr Ulybyshev; the following three utopias by Faddej Bulgarin: “Pravdopodobnye Nebylicy,” “Ili Puteshestvie k Sredotochiju Zemili,” and “Scena iz Chastnoi Zhizni v 2028 Godu ot Rozhdestva Xristova,”, both of which are included in his collected works for 1830; and lastly “4338-j God” (1840) by Vladimir Odoevskij.
