$ABSTRACT:
This study examined the effect of conductor academic task presentation, reinforcement, and student performance on attentiveness, achievement, and attitude of members of a university symphonic band. The band rehearsed five times under three treatment conditions: (A) conductor directions and student performance; (B) conductor academic task presentations, directions, and student performance; and (C) conductor academic task presentations, directions, student performance, and contingent conductor academic reinforcement.Student attentiveness was defined as the percentage of students overtly off-task. Music achievement was independently rated by a panel of expert judges on the basis of audiotape recordings. Student attitude was assessed by a five-question student survey.Results indicated attentiveness was a function of both performance time and treatment. All treatments resulted in gains for music achievement with Treatment B resulting in the smallest and Treatment C resulting in the largest gains. Student attitudes were significantly related to music, conductors, and their interaction. Student ratings of rehearsal enjoyment and conductor as a good teacher were significantly related to treatments, with Treatment C consistently rated highest.
