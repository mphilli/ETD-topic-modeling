$ABSTRACT:
Through information gleaned from semi-structured interviews with twenty-eight (28) security planners in Washington D.C. and New York, this study tracks and explains the application of military doctrine within civil society through the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative. Although many studies have examined the deployment of antiterrorism measures in American cities, very few have explored how domestic security networks are generating unprecedented levels of collaboration between the U.S. intelligence community and state and local law enforcement agencies. The unintended outcome is the encroachment of a bifurcated security network, with interdiction and fortification activities running mostly separate from community preparedness efforts, creating significant changes in domestic security governance. In a broader sense, this is a story of how federal security sets the agenda for local-level practitioners and communities, how governance and planning become affected by federal security policy, and what lessons can be learned to foster a more equitable and sustainable framework for implementation in New York and other U.S. cities.
