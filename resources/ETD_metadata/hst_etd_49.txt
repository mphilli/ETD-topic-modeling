History, social criticism

$ABSTRACT:
This paper is intended to explore African-American thought during the peak period of immigration to determine whether black Americans perceived their condition as comparable to that of other minorities. In particular, did blacks seek to imitate the tactics of other groups in attempting to alter their social position, or did they consider their own status as too dissimilar from that of immigrants of other backgrounds? It is also intended to examine a dimension of African-American thought not directly focused on "the race problem."--Foreword.
