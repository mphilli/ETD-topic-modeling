$ABSTRACT:
This qualitative study explores the experiences of low-income women undergraduates in a community college classroom anchored in decolonial feminist pedagogy.  Analyses of in-depth interviews, student writings, and questionnaires are offered to further understanding of the impact of decolonial feminist pedagogy on the experiences and learning outcomes of low-income women undergraduates in community college, and also works to shed light on how the praxis of decolonial feminist pedagogy disrupts traditional hierarchies and claims to epistemic authority in the community college classroom.
