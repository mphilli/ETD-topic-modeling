$ABSTRACT:
A product  is characterized by its product specifications which denote the size, form, geometry, manufacturing details and other information which provide a complete description (i.e. definition) of the product. The different tasks involved in the generation of these specifications characterizes the product design process  . In this dissertation research, the role of product specifications in the product design process has been investigated. Specifically, we have addressed the following issues: (i) characterization of product specifications into three categories, namely primary (size, form and geometry), secondary (tolerances, surface finish and surface hardness) and tertiary (process plan and NC tool path) specifications, (ii) development of a product specification based product design process model which embodies in it the inter-relationships between the above types of product specifications, (iii) development of a methodology for the decomposition of user defined functional requirements to equivalent functional specifications called as the Part Function Model (PFM) and their transformation to various types of secondary product specifications, (iv) development of algorithms for the synthesis of secondary product specifications which incorporate in them product (functional performance and reliability) and process (process capability, quality and inspection) design issues, (v) formulation of a framework for the generation of tertiary product specifications (process plan and NC tool path) based on the primary and secondary product specifications, and (vi) development and implementation of information models for representation of various types of product specifications in a computer based model of the product which assists in the task of synthesis of product specifications. The methodologies and computer simulation tools developed as part of this research work was tested for different types of parts and assembly configurations. The results obtained from this dissertation research provide new insights to the formulation of product design process models and the inter-relationships between various product specifications during product development activities. We have demonstrated the importance behind the identification and categorization of these inter-relationships and its relevance to the fulfillment of Concurrent Engineering objectives through the synergic consideration of product and process design issues.
