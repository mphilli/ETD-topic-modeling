$ABSTRACT:
In the first part of this thesis, a prescription is given for obtaining the representations of certain non-compact groups â€“ of the kind that have been found useful in the analysis of classical systems. Well known techniques have been used in a systematic fashion, and is necessarily mathematical. However, we apply this technique in the second part to study properties of strongly interacting particles. Results that one obtains is compared against experiment.
