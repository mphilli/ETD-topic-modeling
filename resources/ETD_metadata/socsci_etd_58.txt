$ABSTRACT:
Very little research has been done about domestic violence coalitions, even though they have become a central feature in the community response model. This dissertation focuses specifically on the ways that a particular coalition approaches domestic violence in their community. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observation techniques, it looks in depth about the construction of the problem of domestic violence and appropriate responses to it.A better understanding of the nature and organization of these groups may help newly forming coalitions be more effective, as well as bringing policy makers to a better understanding of their support for these organizations.
