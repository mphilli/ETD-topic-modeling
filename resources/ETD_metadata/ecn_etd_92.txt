$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is a collection of three essays, each of which studies a policy in India that provides a unique circumstance affecting directly or indirectly earnings. The purpose of this work is to analyze how taxation and infrastructure development aspects the current and future earnings using these policiesIn the first essay, I use a national infrastructure development program initiated in India in 2001 to construct new all-season roads (roads that can be used in all-weather especially monsoons) in villages that previously had only had dry-season roads (roads that are difficult to use in monsoons). In the second, I use a new tax on fringe benefits initiated in India in 2005, seeking evidence for the hypothesis that the difference in higher marginal tax rates on wages, relative to lower rates on fringe benefits, induces a reallocation of the total compensation package toward fringe benefits. In the final essay, which uses the same policy as that of first I am interested behind the economic motives of manipulation by the local community to obtain public good road in their locality.
