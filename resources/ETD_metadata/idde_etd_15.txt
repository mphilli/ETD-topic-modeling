$ABSTRACT:
This study explored and discovered the questioning process of first- and second-grade students while working with computerized lessons. Using the grounded theory approach, a conceptual framework of the questioning process of students using computerized instruction in the classroom was developed.Data collection procedures for this study included: observations and one-to-one interviews with first- and second-grade students, first- and second-grade teachers, the teacher aides, the school principal, and the school's technology specialist. Through these methods a conceptual framework of the questioning behavior of first- and second-grade students who worked on computerized lessons in reading. This study found that the questioning behavior was an iterative process that contained four major elements: (1) questioning behavior; (2) types of question; (3) asking the question; and (4) the answer. Other elements including internal and external factors were also discovered and presented in the conceptual framework.Along with developing the conceptual framework, this study concluded that there was far more to asking questions and questioning behavior than just the substance of the questions themselves. As the conceptual framework indicated, both internal and external components were shown to have a direct impact on questioning behavior, questions, the obstacles to asking questions and getting answers. These components were also shown to affect the participants in the process of asking questions and how these participants took part in question asking and answers.
