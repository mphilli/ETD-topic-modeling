$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation seeks to find new--and refine misplaced--representations of Catholic loyalty to produce a comprehensive study of Catholic loyalism in Ireland. The resulting work is an investigation into the political and cultural exigencies and into public discourse regarding ideas of allegiance within Catholic Ireland throughout the eighteenth and on into the nineteenth century. Despite nationalist histories to the contrary, the principles generated by Catholic loyalists helped both set and confound the foundation of modern Irish identity.
