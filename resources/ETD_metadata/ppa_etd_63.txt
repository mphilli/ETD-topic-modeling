$ABSTRACT:
Discusses collective bargaining in the public sector sphere and looks at the two prevailing treatments of the dynamics of the inter-organizational relationships created by public sector collective bargaining. One treatment was particularistic in its orientation; it dwelled on the unique and denied the empirical tenability of generalization about the collective bargaining process in the public service sector. The other treatment was evaluative in its orientation; springing from either the perspective of the larger system in which the organizations belonged or to the perspective of one of the adversary organizations, generalization dwelled on the consequences of collective bargaining. Both treatments appeared to ignore a wealth of social science theory useful for analyzing and understanding the collective bargaining process in the public sector.
