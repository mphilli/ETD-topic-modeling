$ABSTRACT:
This paper is intended to show a general outline of the behavioral norms favored by the various "establishments" in both modern Chinas. Such textbook themes represent an attempt to instill a socially acceptable disposition in youth, at a time when the world is undergoing considerable change. There seem to be mixed results, with both retention of traditional Confucian norms, and with innovation regarding moral values and ideals of behavior.--Preface.
