$ABSTRACT:
Disassembly, a process of separating the End of Life (EOL) product into discrete components for re-utilizing their associated residual values, is an important part for the sustainable manufacturing. This work focuses on the modeling of the disassembly planning related information, and develops a Disassembly Information Model (DIM) based on an extensive investigation of various informational aspects of the disassembly planning. The developed Disassembly Information Model, which represents an appropriate systematization and classification of the products, processes, uncertainties and degradations related information, follows a layered modeling methodology. In this layered configuration, the DIM is subdivided into three distinct layers with an intent to separate general knowledge into different levels of abstractions, and to reach a balance between information reusability and information usability. The performance evaluation of the DIM (usability and reusability) is accessed by successful implementations of the DIM model into two prototype software applications in the domain of disassembly planning.The first application, called the Disassembly Sequence Generator (DSG), identifies the optimal disassembly sequence using a CAD based searching algorithm and a disassembly Linear Programming (LP) model. The searching process results in an AND/OR graph, which represents all the feasible disassembly sequences of a specific EOL product; whereas the LP model takes the AND/OR graph as an input and determines the economically optimal process sequence among all the possibilities.The second application is called the Adaptive Disassembly Planning (ADP), which further takes the EOL product uncertainty and degradation issues into consideration. In order to address these issues, fuzzy logic and Bayesian Network methodologies are used to develop a Disassembly Decision Network (DDN), which adaptively generates the optimal disassembly sequence based on the current available information.This research work is the first attempt to develop a comprehensive Information Model in the domain of disassembly planning. The associated modeling methodology that has been developed in this research is generic and scalable, and it could be widely adopted in other engineering domains, like product assembly, production planning, etc. The ultimate objective of this work is to standardize the DIM into a reference model that will be acknowledged and agreed upon by the sustainable manufacturing community.
