$ABSTRACT:
In this dissertation, I address some limitations of the  literature on the diversionary theory of war through some significant revisions.  My revisions are intended to extend the scope and expand the content of the  literature in order to transform the theory from a theory of war to a foreign  policy theory. In addition, I try to contribute to the theoretical development  of the literature by bringing the leader back into the diversionary theory and  incorporating it into the current literature on foreign policy leadership  studies. The dissertation focuses on Middle Eastern leaders who used  diversionary strategies during the First Gulf War in 1991 and in its immediate  aftermath. Some of the foreign policies of Hafiz Assad of Syria, King Hussein of  Jordan, and Saddam Hussein of Iraq during this period have been interpreted as  intended to divert the attention of their people and unify their people around  their flags. These foreign policies will be analyzed in relation to the  leadership traits of the three Middle Eastern political leaders.
