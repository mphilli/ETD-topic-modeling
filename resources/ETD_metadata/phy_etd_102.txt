$ABSTRACT:
This study attempts to contribute to the differentiation of theoretical assumptions by representing charged particles (spin zero) by wave packets of Volkov solutions, and by representing the external field by a finite length pulse. The more general goal of this paper is the development of a formalism which can be applied to any quantum electrodynamic process involving a charged particle in a laser pulse.--Page 2.
