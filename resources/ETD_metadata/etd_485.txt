$ABSTRACT:
Career growth in academia is often dependent on student reviews of university profes-sors. A growing concern is how evaluation of teaching has been affected by gender biasesthroughout the reviewing process. However, pinpointing the exact causes and consequen-tial effects of this form of gender inequality has been a hard task.Current work focusses on university-wide student reviewing system, that depends onobjective responses on a Likert scale to measure various aspects of an instructorâ€™s qual-ity. Through our work, we access online student review data which are not limited bygeographies, universities, or disciplines.Thereafter, we come up with a systematic approach to assess the various ways in whichgender inequality is apparent from the student reviews. We also suggest a possible wayin which bias related to the gender of a professor could be detected from both objectivenumerical measures and subjective opinions in reviews. Finally, we assess a logistic re-gression learning algorithm to find the most important factors that can help in identifyinggender inequality.
