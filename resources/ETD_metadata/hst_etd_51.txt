$ABSTRACT:
Milan Hodža was among the most important figures in the political history of the first Czechoslovak republic. This study is an examination of Hodža’s participation in the Slovak national movement, from the time of his emergence as a national leader in 1898 to the culmination of the movement in 1918. The purpose of this work is to trace his development as a political leader, examining the nature of his role in the national movement, evaluating the impact of his activities within the context of that movement, and analyzing his values, goals and tactics. Of necessity, this study is as much chronological and descriptive as it is analytical, since it is the first study of Hodža’s entire political activities in the Slovak national period.
