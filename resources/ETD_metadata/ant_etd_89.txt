$ABSTRACT:
Integrating theoretical and methodological approaches to  formation processes across a range of scales from micro-artifact to region and  from historical to environmental processes, this work explores the archaeology  of the event related to submerged archaeological sites within the Elmina  seascape of coastal Ghana. Building on and intersecting with the work of other  scholars, this research is a unique approach to the investigation of submerged  cultural remains related to historical maritime trade. Remote sensing surveys in  2009 led to the identification of three sites related to maritime trade, adding  significantly to the two previously known sites, which include a circa 1650  shipwreck, referred to as the Elmina Wreck, and the remains of an early 18th  century vessel in the Benya Lagoon. Drawing on remote sensing survey data, diver  investigations, and the micro-sampling sediment coring technique developed over  the course of field research, the historical and physical environment of coastal  Elmina is studied as a means of interpreting the unique events surrounding a  specific shipwreck, and to relate formation processes across the region to this  and other sites. While archaeological evidence is limited, the complex study of  formation processes, including the historical contexts of trade and the physical  environmental has provided insights into events and practices of trade,  destruction and preservation of submerged sites, and has provided a foundation  for continued holistic investigation and maritime archaeological studies in the  region. The methodological and theoretical approaches to formation processes  form a model applicable to maritime research across the globe.
