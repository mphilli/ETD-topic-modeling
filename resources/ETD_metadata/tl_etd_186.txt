$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation constitutes an attempt to investigate the comparative usefulness of several approaches to the development of reading comprehension. The use of cloze materials for this purpose is being compared with more traditional comprehension questions. Students working in small groups are compared with students working independently, and also, students working in small groups are further compared in groups formed heterogeneously versus groups formed homogeneously.--Page 1.
