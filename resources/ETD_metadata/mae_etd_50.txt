$TITLE:
Modelling of crack tip deformation with finite-element method and its applications

$DEPARTMENT:
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

$KEYWORDS:
crack tip deformation

$ABSTRACT:
A finite element computer program using initial stress approach of elastic-plastic analysis was developed. Crack tip deformation under small scale yielding condition was studied. Dugdale model was reviewed. The elastic-plastic strip yielding model does not agree with the classic Dugdale model.
