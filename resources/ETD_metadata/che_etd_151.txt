Cyclic ligands containing the amide linkage and manganese macrocyclic complexes containing an azo group

ester bonds, peptide bonds

$ABSTRACT:
The synthesis of the cyclic ligands containing the amide linkage will be discussed in the following sections of this work. Hydrolysis of the amide linkage plays a great role in the biological systems.  Although a large number of metal  complexes containing the amide linkage  where studied and fully characterized, cyclic compounds containing this linkage have not been explored.
