$ABSTRACT:
Compared to most other states in India, Tamil Nadu is noted for  widespread provision of education, primary health care, nutrition  support, rural roads, electricity, water and other public services.  These services are typically well planned and tend to work well. I  examine what determines Tamil Nadu's performance. I argue that  widespread and decentralized collective action for public services plays  a critical role in it but such collective action is a new phenomenon,  dating back to the seventies. I also argue that normative challenges by  major social movements, changing influences of various social groups and  raising individual capabilities among common people played an  instrumental role in enabling such collective action that ultimately had  an impact on public services.
