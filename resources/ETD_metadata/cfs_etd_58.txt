$ABSTRACT:
This study examined the influence of parental factors and the moderating effects of parents' ethnic identification and children's self-regulation on the academic performance of Asian Indian American children in the United States. A total of 101 immigrant Asian Indian fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire on their involvement in children's education (specifically on parental academic socialization at home and parent school engagement) and an adapted version of the Suinn-Lew instrument that measures immigrant Asian Indian parents' ethnic identity. Children's (mean age = 7.4 years) academic performance was assessed using the Mini Battery of Achievement test. Children also completed the Academic Self-Regulatory Behavior questionnaire. Results showed that Asian Indian American children were in the Superior range in their overall academic performance. Both fathers and mothers engaged in high levels of academic socialization at home but had moderate levels of school engagement. High levels of educational activities with children at home and ethnic identification as Indian were linked to better academic skills. Children who were externally regulated performed better academically than children who were internally regulated. Differential influences of fathers' and mothers' involvement on children's academic skills were also evident. Data are interpreted with respect to academic socialization at home and cultural identity in shaping Asian Indian immigrant children's early academic skills.
