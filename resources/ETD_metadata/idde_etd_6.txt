$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to learn the individual and situational factors that influenced teachers' perceptions of integrating graphing calculators into mathematics classrooms and teachers' perspectives and perceptions about the usefulness of graphing calculators for student success on the New York State Math B Regents Exam. This dissertation reported on an exploratory qualitative investigation of the practices and perceptions of teachers in three high schools in three suburban school districts in a medium-sized city in Central New York. The group investigated consisted of 13 mathematics teachers who taught the Regents level and other advance-level courses to 10 th through 12 th grade students in the 2003-04 academic year. This study identified: (1) the individual and situational factors that influenced teachers' perspectives and perceptions about the usefulness of graphing calculators for student success; (2) the impact of the individual and situational factors on the effective integration of the graphing calculator; (3) teachers' perceptions about the integration of graphing calculator into classroom instruction; (4) the levels and types of teachers' graphing calculator integration; and (5) teachers' perceptions about the relationship between graphing calculator use and integration in instruction and student performance on the Math B Regents exam in NYS. This study was valuable in giving an opportunity to teachers to address their thoughts, practices, and perceptions on the use of graphing calculators.This study can help educators and policy-makers to understand teachers' needs regarding professional development, pedagogical guidance, and technical support. Also, future regulations on the state curriculum, standardized test exams, and mathematics education standards should take into account teachers' perceptions about the use of calculators in order to understand how to make effective use of those technologies in the classrooms.
