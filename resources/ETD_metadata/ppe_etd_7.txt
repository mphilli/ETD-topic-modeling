$ABSTRACT:
Background: Loss of muscle strength is evident even in apparently healthy older adults. functionally limited due to an increasing discrepancy between their own physiological capabilities (i.e. physiological impairments) and the challenges set forth by the environment. Functional limitations lead to clinical mobility disability. Clinical mobility disability is associated with physical dependence, poor quality of life, and mortality. Treatment of age-related clinical mobility disability should focus on the prevention of the condition rather than its consequences. Identifying opportunities for early screening and prevention of clinical mobility disability requires a better understanding of the functional loss prior to this medical condition.Aims: The global aim of this dissertation was to examine if measures of leg strength are clinically relevant bio-markers of daily task modifications among community dwelling older adults living independently.
