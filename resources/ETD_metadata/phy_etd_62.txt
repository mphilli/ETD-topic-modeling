$ABSTRACT:
In this thesis we present a new determination of [Special characters omitted.] using 5 million [Special characters omitted.] events obtained with the CLEO II detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). Our value is derived from our new measured ratio [Special characters omitted.] . Using [Special characters omitted.] , we extract [Special characters omitted.] MeV. We compare this result with various model calculations.
