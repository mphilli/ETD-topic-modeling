$ABSTRACT:
This study investigates how female student members in campus  organizations for women of color discuss black self-identification and  their understandings of race, ethnicity, and gender. Through qualitative  research and a framework that employs postpositivist realism and  intersectionality, the study examines how the women's interpretations of  their race, ethnicity, and gender factor into their black political  identification. The dissertation attends to the limitations of  ethnocentric, masculinist meanings of black and the ways in which  intra-racial gender and ethnic differences, when framed in  non-intersectional ways, are depoliticized and misperceived as  counter-productive threats to racial solidarity. While addressing the  need to centralize the significance of gender and ethnicity within  meanings of black, this study helps to situate black racial justice as  contingent upon gender justice and recognition of oppression as  interlocking. The study also illuminates the central role that framing  plays in understanding and dismantling interlocked systemic domination.  Implications for higher education are discussed.
