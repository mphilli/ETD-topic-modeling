$ABSTRACT:
College serves as a critical time in the lives of young adults in the formulation of their identification with citizenship, of their sense of belonging or affiliation. In an era of increasing globalization, this psychological dimension of citizenship requires further research and elaboration. This project seeks to determine if and how the academic and off-campus choices students make in college impact their worldview, their loyalties and sense of responsibility toward others. How far do students' allegiances extend and what experiences in college help to create these bonds and commitments? This study asks whether international experience via study abroad is a necessary ingredient for students to begin to re-imagine the boundaries of their social communities and their responsibilities as global citizens, or whether these processes can occur through more locally or nationally-oriented service learning, volunteer, or internship experiences.This project combines several strands of scholarship including cosmopolitanism (particularly its more contemporary, relational extrapolations and usefulness to understanding the underpinnings of citizen responsibility today) and political socialization (focusing on the expansion of one's in-group and the formation of multiple loyalties), viewed through the lens of the Millennial Generation. The study involves a detailed survey of undergraduate upperclassmen enrolled at Syracuse University's Maxwell School and provides a model for cosmopolitan learning.
