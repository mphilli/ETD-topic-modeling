$ABSTRACT:
For a finite quiver without oriented cycles, we study the set of (+)-admissible sequences as introduced in [BGP]. We show how the nonisomorphic indecomposable preprojective modules can be characterized in terms of (+)-admissible sequences and establish a connection with the classical characterization presented, for example, in [ARS].
