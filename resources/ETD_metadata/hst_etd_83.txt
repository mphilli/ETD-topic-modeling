$ABSTRACT:
Until 1938, the regulation of child labor in the United States was entirely in the hands of the individual states. Two federal laws were in effect for a very brief period, but both were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and a proposed Child Labor Amendment to the Constitution failed to be ratified by the necessary number of states. Yet in spite of the fact that the history of the child labor problem was the history of state efforts to curtail it, very few critical accounts of the struggle within the states exist. Of particular interest and significance was the campaign to end child labor in the populous, industrial state of New York. Entering the twentieth century with a formidable child labor problem, New York emerged forty years later with one of the highest legislative standards in the United States. That it did so was almost entirely due to the efforts of the New York Child Labor Committee (1902-1942).
