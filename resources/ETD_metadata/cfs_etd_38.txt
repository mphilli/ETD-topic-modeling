$ABSTRACT:
The life course perspective provided a framework for considering relationships between young adult grandchildren and their grandparents and parents. Emphases were placed on: (1) continuity and change over time, (2) perceived roles and role behaviors as intergenerational scripts, (3) family dyadic relationships within larger familial contexts, (4) cultural and ethnic traditions as important influences in familial roles, expectations and behaviors and (5) a multidisciplinary study of family relationships. This study presented a model of grandparent-parent-grandchild relationships with family structure variables of gender, lineage, caregiving histories and geographical distance as well as race/ethnicity as predictors of grandparent-grandchild relationship characteristics, shared activities and grandchildren's role conceptions. Parent relationships and contacts were found to be mediating variables in the three-generational family structure.
