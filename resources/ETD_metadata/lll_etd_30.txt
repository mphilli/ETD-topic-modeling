$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate the novels of eleven contemporary Cuban novelists whose themes are derived principally from the Cuban scene. To date, no intensive study has been made of these novels as a group and, of most, even individually. The panoramic view indicates prevailing novelistic currents and particular talents at mid-century. The recurrent themes are a review of existent social patterns. These aspects and these novels would seem to have been unfairly slighted by other than Cuban critics.
