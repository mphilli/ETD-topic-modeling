$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is about innovation - the setting is business  models. I have defined innovativeness in business models as a novel departure  from what others in the same industry are using for their business model design.  Utilizing evolutionary theory, I focus upon organizational routines to identify  innovation. I explored characteristics within the firm associated with  innovativeness in the business model including customer information processes;  willingness to pursue experimentation and complexity added to the business model  from the addition of non-core products. Inertia in the firm was considered as a  moderator between each of these variables and innovativeness. Performance was  measured using criteria relevant to the industry - quality, awards won by the  winery and revenue growth.    Several implications follow from the results. First, An important  implication of the research is that evolutionary theory is a useful lens to  elaborate mechanisms associated with innovative business models and can serve  for future research to theoretically ground investigations into innovation in  business models. Second, my methodology served as a contribution by providing an  ability to objectively identify innovative business models. Third, the  importance of understanding your customers aids in developing innovative  business models. Fourth, experimentation allows firms to develop and evaluate  changes to the business model that can lead to innovation. Fifth, firms should  recognize that as procedures and business models become ingrained it is more  difficult to pursue an innovative business models. Finally, innovation is  equally important for improving performance in both low- tech and high-tech  environments.
