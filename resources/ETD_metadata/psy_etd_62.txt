$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of the present study was to examine the immediate and long-term effects of providing school-based consultation training on preservice teachers' knowledge, problem-solving skills, and acceptance of school-based consultation. Eighty undergraduate education students participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (a) pretest-training in school based consultation-posttest-follow up, (b) pretest-training in general education-posttest-follow up, (c) training in school based consultation-posttest, and (d) posttest.Using a group comparison design with data collected at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up, participants' skills, knowledge, and acceptability regarding school-based consultation were assessed. It was expected that for the dependent measures of skill, knowledge, and acceptance, the mean scores on the post-test assessment would be significantly greater than the mean scores on the pre-test assessment for those individuals who attended the training session in school-based consultation. In addition, it was expected that preservice teachers who attended the training session in school-based consultation would perform better than those who did not, on all dependent measures regardless if they were exposed to the pretest. Furthermore, it was suspected that the passage of time would not have an effect on the dependent measures. Results of this study suggest that pre-service training in school-based consultation is an effective approach to improving skill, knowledge, and acceptability of school-based consultation. A number of consultation service delivery models that influence the practice of school consultation are reviewed.
