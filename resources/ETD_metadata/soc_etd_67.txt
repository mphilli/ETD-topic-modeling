$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation blends traditional ethnographic data from  interviews and observations with digital ethnographic data from blogs and  YouTube videos to present stories of identity, community, and activist-oriented  experiences from white cisgender women who are partnered with trans-identified  people on the FTM spectrum. The project addresses the following broad questions:  How does being the cisgender partner of a trans person inform complexities  around the ability to articulate sexual identity? How are cisgender partners  finding community and organizing themselves into new forms of community when  they often lack language with which to describe their relationships? In what  ways are cisgender people allies to the trans people with whom they partner, and  how is being an ally connected to forms of everyday resistance and educational  advocacy? How does technology play a role in articulations of identity,  experiences of community, and the ways that partners participate in  activism?This work queers sociology by illustrating and considering the  potential consequences of normative categories of gender and sexuality in  relation to everyday lived experience. This project brings out the tension for  many cis partners between a desire to belong by using normative categories of  identity, coupled with a complex need to also resist those categories.  Relatedly, I examine how the problems of identity for cis partners impact their  access to various identity-based communities, and I instead argue for a queer  politics of affinity. Further, this work calls for a broadening of what  constitutes "activism" in order to consider the everyday actions and advocacy  work that partners engage in as contributing to and encouraging social change  around trans issues. Accordingly, my work contributes not only to the fields of  queer and trans studies, but also to a sociology of gender and sexuality that  takes queer and trans studies seriously in terms of theoretical contexts and  analyses.
