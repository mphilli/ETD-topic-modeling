$ABSTRACT:
Following steady development over the past two decades, the theory and measurement of Raman optical activity (ROA) have both reached a sophisticated level. This dissertation presents advances in ROA in the areas of artifact control, experimental measurements, theoretical intensity computation, isolation of pre-resonance behavior and observation of surfaced-enhanced phenomena.Backscattering incident circular polarization (ICP) and in-phase dual circular polarization (DCP$\sb{\rm I}$) ROA have been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally to be the best configurations for routine ROA studies on biological molecules in the far-from-resonance limit. Since DCP$\sb{\rm I}$ ROA provides better signal-to-noise ratios and artifact control when both methods are available on the same ROA instrument, backscattering DCP$\sb{\rm I}$ ROA spectra were recorded for terpene molecules, (($-$)-trans-pinane, ($-$)-cis-myrtanylamine, ($-$)- -pinene, ($-$)- -pinene, (+)-nopinone, ($-$)-verbenone, ($-$)-myrtenol, ($-$)-nopol, ($-$)-myrtenal, ($-$)-fenchone, (+)-limonene, and ($-$)-carvone as neat liquids, and ($-$)-camphor and ($-$)-camphene in CCl$\sb4$), ephedrine molecules, ((1S,2R)-ephedrine, (1S,2R)-norephedrine, (1S,2S)-pseudoephedrine and (1S,2S)-norpseudoephedrine in HCl aqueous solution), an amino acid, (L-alanine in H$\sb2$O and D$\sb2$O solution), four peptides, (glycyl-L-alanine, L-alanylglycine, L-alanyl-L-alanine and L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanine in H$\sb2$O and D$\sb2$O solution), and two proteins, (lysozyme and albumin).Theoretical Raman and ROA intensities for L-alanine, L-alanine-2-d$\sb1$ and L-alanine-3,3,3-d$\sb3$ in H$\sb2$O and D$\sb2$O solution were calculated by using ab initio methods with a 6-31G* basis set. A self-consistent-field calculation with the inclusion of an Onsager reaction field to simulate solvent effects was found necessary to stabilize properly the zwitterionic form of alanine. A high level of agreement was found between experiment and calculation for both Raman and ROA spectra.By comparing backscattering ICP and DCP$\sb{\rm I}$ ROA and right-angle ICP and scattered circular polarization (SCP) ROA spectra, pre-resonance ROA behavior was observed. The gradual breakdown of the far-from-resonance approximation was observed by comparing ROA spectra for ($-$)-trans-pinane, ($-$)- -pinene, ($-$)-verbenone and (+)-quinidine. The differences between backscattering ICP and DCP$\sb{\rm I}$ ROA spectra also resulted in an indirect observation of out-of-phase dual circular polarization (DCP$\sb{\rm II}$) ROA signal.Possible observation of surface-enhanced ROA phenomena for quinidine in an AgCl colloid is reported here for the first time. The experiment was carried out by using a backscattering DCP$\sb{\rm I}$ ROA configuration. This may open a new frontier for ROA studies.
