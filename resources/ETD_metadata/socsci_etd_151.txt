$ABSTRACT:
Preface: Since World War I, race relations in Texas have gone through a social revolution with comparatively little violence. That there are still injustices and discriminations based on race cannot be denied, but the general trend has been upward and the results have been on the side of desirable progress. Many national and international forces have contributed to this development, but one of the most important was the movement for political and educational equality generated in Texas by Negroes themselves and vigorously prosecuted between 1920 and 1950.
