$ABSTRACT:
Taliba, which means "Sentinel," is a Tagalog daily newspaper which traces its beginnings to pre-World War II days. In competition with English-language newspapers (which, oddly enjoyed greater prestige and invariably had bigger circulation), Taliba and two other Tagalog newspapers were put out by editors and writers who were essentially literary men. Up to 1966 Taliba had a circulation of only 19,000 and 21,000 daily and an income from advertising which was consistently declining. As 1966 drew to a close [the executive editor] was given the responsibility of making a study of Taliba's prospects and finding out what might be done to rehabilitate it.In 1967, with the full and enthusiastic cooperation of management, Taliba's staff began an experiment which eventually resulted in the emergence of a new Tagalog paper -- new in its physical appearance, new in its development of the news and new in its language. The experiment threw the gates of communication wide open and brought in an amazingly substantial body of readers, which apparently all these years had lain quiescent. For years it had read no newspapers, since no newspaper that spoke its language was published. During 1969 Taliba's two daily editions grew to a combined average of 161,000, with a peak of 200,000.
