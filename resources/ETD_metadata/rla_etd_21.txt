$ABSTRACT:
This study was undertaken to test the efficacy of a new instructional procedure designed to improve reading comprehension. The basic question under consideration was whether this technique was relatively more effective for its intended purpose than an established method. The experimental technique in question has the teacher and the student engage in reciprocal questioning (ReQuest) episodes over textual material. An episode is that segment of a reading comprehension lesson which begins with questioning between the teacher and student and ends with the formulation of a purpose for reading.
