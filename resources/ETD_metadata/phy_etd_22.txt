$ABSTRACT:
The Υ(5S) resonance has long been thought to be a source of  B s   mesons, since it is massive enough to produce  B s  B s   pairs. In this work, we establish the presence of B s   mesons at the Υ(5S) energy and measure its production rate using both beauty and charm decays. We use all the e  +  e   -  collision data collected by the CLEO III detector at the Υ(5S) and at the Υ(4S) resonance energies. This data consists of 0.423 fb  -1  on the Υ(5S) resonance, 6.34 fb -1  on the Υ(4S) and 2.32 fb -1  in the continuum below the Υ(4S). We also use 281 pb -1  data accumulated with the CLEO-c detector on the ψ (3770) resonance and another 195 pb  -1  taken in the region near 4170 MeV center-of-mass energy.In the first analysis, we measure the asymmetry of D s meson production in Υ(4S) and Υ(5S) decays as [Special characters omitted.] (Υ(5 S ) [arrow right] D s X )/[Special characters omitted.] (Υ(4S) [arrow right] D s X ) = (2:5 ± [Special characters omitted.] ). We take advantage of this asymmetry, which is due to the difference of B and B s meson production in the decays of the two resonances, to establish B s meson production in Υ(5S) decays and measure its fraction, f s , as (16:8±[Special characters omitted.] )% using a theoretical estimate of (92±11)% for the inclusive branching ratio [Special characters omitted.] ( B s [arrow right] D s X ). We also show the dependence of this measurement on the [Special characters omitted.] [arrow right] [straight phi]π + branching fraction.Knowledge of the B s production rate at the Υ(5S) resonance is imperative for B s studies at the Υ(5S) using current B -factories, and for future e + e - Super- B Factories. We show in the second part of this work that the determination of f s in a model independent manner requires several tens of fb -1 . We present a method that provides a measurement of f s using the relative rates of like-sign versus opposite sign dileptons; the like-sign leptons result from B 0 and B s mixing. In addition, we show that determining the rates of single, double and triple [Special characters omitted.] mesons provides an alternative way of finding f s .To constrain our knowledge of B s production at the Υ(5S) by making other measurements with other model dependencies, we examine CLEO-c data for other particle species than D s , that are produced with much higher rate in B s meson decays than in B meson decays. Such particle like η, η' and [straight phi], with their ss quark composition, are expected to be enhanced in D s than in D meson decays. We therefore measure the inclusive branching fractions of charm mesons, namely D 0 , D + and [Special characters omitted.] , into η X , η' X , and [straight phi] X decays. We find that the rates from [Special characters omitted.] are much larger than from D 0 and D + .We use the inclusive [straight phi] meson yields which is higher by one order of magnitude in D s than in D decays to make a second measurement of [Special characters omitted.] (Υ(5 S ) [arrow right] [Special characters omitted.] ) using our model estimate of [Special characters omitted.] ( B s [arrow right] [straight phi] X ). We measure [Special characters omitted.] (Υ(5 S ) [arrow right] [straight phi] X ) = (13:8 ± [Special characters omitted.] )% and [Special characters omitted.] (Υ(4 S ) [arrow right] [straight phi] X ) = (7:1 ± 0:1 ± 0:6)%, the ratio of the two rates is (1:9 ± [Special characters omitted.] ). This is the first measurement of the [straight phi] meson yield from the Υ(5S). We measure f s = (24:6±[Special characters omitted.] )% and we also report on the total Υ(5 S ) hadronic cross section above continuum to be σ( e + e - Υ(5 S )) = (0:301 ± 0:002 ± 0:039) nb. This allows us to extract the fraction of B mesons as (58:9 ± 10:0 ± 9:2)%, equal to 1- f s . Averaging the three methods gives a model dependent result of f s = ([Special characters omitted.] )%.
