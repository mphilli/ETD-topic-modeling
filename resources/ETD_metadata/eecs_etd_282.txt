$ABSTRACT:
Continued increase in the complexity and use of computer systems in a wide variety of applications has necessitated a greater emphasis on the development of cost-effective and reliable software ... This has led to the evolutin of a new discipline, called software engineering ...In this dissertation, we are concerned with the development of stochastic models for the software failure process under imperfect debugging or maintenance...
