$ABSTRACT:
My research looks at and investigates popular creativity and the politics involved in two different cases. I situate popular creativity and the politics involved in the context of cultural studies.My first case looks at advertisements that are placed under attack, or busted. I investigate the different politics of defamiliarization between two specific busted ads.  The politics of defamiliarization create moving images based on the Freudian uncanny and Brechtian Verfremdung.   My second case involves Harry Potter fans and fan fiction writing. Specifically, I investigate the politics of closure or stereotyping involved in a copyright dispute over the publication of the so-called Harry Potter Lexicon.Methodologically speaking, I am `on the case'. In being `on the case', politics happen too, which concern the production of knowledge over equality. I situate equality in the context of Jacques Ranci√®re's understanding of it, alongside his understanding of people, politics, and what he refers to as police. In building my research cases, I offer a form of popular knowledge.
