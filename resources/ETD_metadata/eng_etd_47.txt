New Critics, Murray Krieger, The New Apostles of Poetry, Literary theory

$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to characterize the New Criticism as a critical movement displaying and encouraging, in the practice and theory of most of its adherents, romantic features of mine and sensibility that are implicitly in conflict with the principles of art and culture which the New Critics consciously subscribe to. The procedures undertaken here are rather literary in kind, involving to a very large extent interpretation of the constituents and transformations of the critics' key vocabularies, even of their styles. This study is, as a result, something of a complement to Murray Krieger's skillful and thorough inquiry, in "The New Apologists for Poetry" (University of Minnesota Press, 1956), into the literary theory of the New Criticism. To use Ransom's figure, where Krieger is principally interested in the "structure" of New Criticism, I am primarily interested in its "texture."
