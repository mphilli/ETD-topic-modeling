$ABSTRACT:
In this dissertation I explore the idea of a 'theology of beauty' in the  work of the Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, and highlight  how Balthasar has tried to recover an aesthetic dimension in theology  which he maintains has been eclipsed--particularly in the (post-)modern  era. Balthasar elaborates this through a discussion of several figures,  and I look at his treatment of the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins in an  effort to show how Hopkins' poetry (on Balthasar's reading) can be  considered at once aesthetical and theological: i.e., a 'theological  aesthetic'. In light of this, I provide a critical evaluation of  Balthasar's project, and consider its implications for, and potential  contributions to, theological discourse.
