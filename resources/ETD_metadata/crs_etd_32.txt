$ABSTRACT:
This study attempts to evaluate the contributions of Ms. Jones (assessed by some as one of the leading performers on the American stage of the late 19th and early 20th century) by presenting her biography within the framework of the political, social, and economic climates of the time. The study of the career of Sissieretta Jones, encompassing her performances, critiques of her work, the type of management she was forced to accept, and the restrictions on where she could perform, all become a study of the cultural conditions of her time.--Page v.
