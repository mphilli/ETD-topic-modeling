$ABSTRACT:
This study reviews and evaluates the operation and effects of resale price maintenance in the United States over the ten year period, 1940-1950, in which this practice was permissible in all the states except Texas, Missouri, and Vermont, in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and in interstate commerce. The study contains a brief history of the activities and forces connected with resale price maintenance before this period, the nature and trends of federal and state laws pertinent to it, the judicial interpretation of its scope, a presentation and and interpretation of some of its institutional aspects, and finally a consideration of its economic implications. Brief reference is made also to British and Canadian experience with resale price maintenance in order to provide a broader perspective. Some of the important events affecting fair trade after the period under consideration are included as they are relevant to the study.
