$ABSTRACT:
The present study assessed the effectiveness of preschool teachers of India with respect to their interactions with young children and parents. Specifically, the impact of teacher training, satisfaction with training, job satisfaction, years of experience, and class size on the nature of interactions with children and parents were examined. Perceptions of parents and teachers on the nature of interactions were sought. Sixty-five preschool teachers, and 173 parents from a city in India comprised the total sample. Results indicated that according to teacher reports, none of the variables emerged significant for teacher-child interactions. From teacher-parent interactions, 32% of the variance was accounted for. Satisfaction with training and job emerged as significantly related to teacher-parent interactions. Amount of training, years of experience and class size did not impact teacher-parent interactions. These findings suggested the interplay of some cultural factors within Indian society, such as limited space, finances, beliefs about teaching and education, and cultural notions of relationships between adults and children. The results also indicated the possibility of specificity of pathways that could impact the teacher-child and teacher-parent interactions.
