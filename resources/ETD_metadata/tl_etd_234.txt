$ABSTRACT:
This research engages a combined qualitative methodology of  arts-informed research and critical descriptive ethnography to study thirteen  adolescent artists with autism as they engage in art making across multiple art  education contexts. This study revealed the perceptions of stakeholders about  art and autism that informed the access these adolescent artists had to art  education and art materials. These perceptions included varying ideas of  competence, ability and struggle associated with an identity as `autistic'. In  the examination of these adolescents' experiences the engagement with art making  and the role of art in the lives of these artists is explored. It is shown that  art functions as communication and a way of connecting to the world around them,  acting as a form of literacy through the visual text of their artwork. This  study offers a paradigm for inclusive art education that operates within the  social model of dis/ability and considers strategies for full inclusion with art  curriculum and art materials. Recommendations for families, art teachers of  students with autism and art teacher preparation are provided.
