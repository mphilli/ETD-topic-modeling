$ABSTRACT:
We searched for η  b   via hindered M1 transitions Υ(3  S  ) [arrow right] γη  b   and Υ(2  S  ) [arrow right] γη  b   using CLEO-II data. No significant evidence for such transitions was found, and we set upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios that contradict many phenomenological estimates for the rates of these transitions.
