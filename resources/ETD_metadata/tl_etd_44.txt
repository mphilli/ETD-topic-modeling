$ABSTRACT:
This inquiry critically examines the discourse around intervention methods grounded in applied behavioral analysis (ABA) for young children labeled with autism. In this analysis, I explore the ways that these instructional methods are discussed and discursively represented in a variety of venues, including academic and professional literature, published parent narratives, judicial and government documents, popular media, and parents' conversational discussions of their children's education. I draw upon two primary and interrelated data sources in this analysis: texts (gathered through purposeful sampling of ABA literature) and talk (gathered through in-depth, qualitative interviews and participant observation with parents of young children labeled with autism who participate in ABA discourse). I interpret the data using two complementary strategies of analysis: Foucauldian discourse analysis and ethnomethodological analysis of talk, thus interpreting the broader ABA discourse that parents draw upon as a discursive "regime" that may "discipline" the ways in which parents interpret, represent, and indeed constitute their own experiences with ABA. Through ongoing inductive analysis of all data sources, I identify and analyze two different "Conversations" within ABA discourse: (a) the notion of "recovery" from autism, and (b) the notion of "scientific" proof. I conduct this qualitative analysis of the language drawn upon to describe, discuss, and represent this particular educational method as a device for exploring the underlying intersections of knowledge, ideology, and power in educational discourse, and the ways that language may mediate and shape educational research, practice, and policy.
