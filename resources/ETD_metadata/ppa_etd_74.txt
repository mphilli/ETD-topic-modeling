$ABSTRACT:
In 1959, while employed in the New York State Workmen's Compensation Board, I asked Colonel S.E. Senior, chairman of the workmen's compensation board, for guidance in selecting a topic for a doctoral dissertation.  Colonel Senioe suggested I explore the "potential of a topic treating with the impending major medical insuracne program, its historic origins, its present evolution and the ramifications of its portents...My major concern is the development and implications of a CEHI program in New York State during Governor Rockefeller's first term (1959 through 1962).
