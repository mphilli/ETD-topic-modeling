$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to document some of the unique and important contributions which the Chautauqua Institution at Chautauqua, New York made to American education in the late nineteenth century. Although this is a historical study, Chautauqua still exists as a thriving institution. Consequently, an attempt is made to describe and compare its present functions with those which were instituted during the first summers of its existence. There are two specific areas of concentration: speech and audio-visual education.
