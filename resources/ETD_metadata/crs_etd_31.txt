$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation investigates the meaning and function of the fine arts in the behavioral patterns, education, discipline, and standards inculcated by the organized worship services of evangelical, revivalistic Southern Baptists. This paper seeks to probe the mores of a regional culture as expressed through the fine arts conjunctive to the religious belief predominant in the region. Via this focus, the author seeks to offer a picture of a segment of American society, and to touch upon the sociology of religion.--Preface.
