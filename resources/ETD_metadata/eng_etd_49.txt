$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation attempts two goals: to present for the first time a full and careful analysis of Webster's imagery with respect to its function as a stylistic device for the economical presentation of character and exposition, the rapid establishment of mood, the skeletal structuring of the drama, the presentation of the thematic line, and the deepening of the significance of the drama without increasing the bulk; and to define freshly and more inclusively than has been done before, the methods used by Webster to achieve the above-mentioned effects.
