$ABSTRACT:
The present study is intended to cast some light on the problem of T. glauca, but in so doing a slightly different experimental approach has been developed and applied. In the first part, intra-and interspecific hybridization of the three species, T. latifolia, T. angustifolia, and T. glauca, produced significant alterations in certain seed characteristics. There were color, dimensions of the external cellular layer, endosperm width, embryo width, and embryo length. ... In the second part, the relative fecundity of the species as measured by seed yield, together with external seed dimensions, seed weight and the above seed characteristics, were related to the issue of the origin of T. glauca. ...
