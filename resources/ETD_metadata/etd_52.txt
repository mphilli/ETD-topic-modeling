$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation investigates the effect of trade liberalization in a trading partner country on labor market outcomes, and the export wage premium. The first chapter studies the impact of trade liberalization in China on the firm-level skilled labor employment share in Korea. The second chapter examines the existence of the export wage premium. The third chapter explores the response of partner-country tariffs on productivity. My findings highlight the importance of partner-country trade liberalization in enhancing firm performance via productivity and share of skilled labor, and the existence of the export wage premium in Korea.
