$ABSTRACT:
During the past decade, large design and production industries have been exploring efficient Computer-Aided Design (CAD) methods for the controlled generation of free-form curve and surface shapes. Their goal is to obtain a mathematical model of a particular object to be used in its manufacturing process. This dissertation addresses itself to one such mathematical scheme for interactive shape design on a computer graphics display. The approach differs from the traditional in that a mathematical model is produced during definition of the design object. This "ab initio" design situation avoids the inaccurate and costly procedure of first producing a physical model and then attempting to fit a mathematical model to it.
