$ABSTRACT:
In this investigation, the recreational reading of 190 fifth grade children in suburban schools was studies. Children were trained to record all books read outside of school. Certain conditions were controlled to foster honesty and accuracy in the children's records of their readings. The purposes of the investigation were a) to collect data concerning the amount of reading done by the children, b) to observe the effects of two factors --- accessibility and recommendation -- upon the number of books read by the children, and c) to determine whether the number of books could be shown to be correlated with gain in reading achievement test scores in vocabulary comprehension.
