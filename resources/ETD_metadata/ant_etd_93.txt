$ABSTRACT:
Aghoreshwar Mahaprabhu Baba Bhagawan Ram Ji, a well-established  saint of the holy city of Varanasi in north India, initiated many changes into  the erstwhile Aghor tradition of ascetics in India. This tradition is regarded  as an ancient system of spiritual or mystical knowledge by its practitioners and  at least some of the practices followed in this tradition can certainly be  traced back at least to the time of the Buddha. Over the course of the centuries  practitioners of this tradition have interacted with groups of other mystical  traditions, exchanging ideas and practices so that both parties in the exchange  appear to have been influenced by the other. Naturally, such an interaction  between groups can lead to difficulty in determining a clear course of  development of the tradition. In this dissertation I bring together  micro-history, hagiography, folklore, religious and comparative studies together  in an attempt to understand how this modern day religious-spiritual tradition  has been shaped by the past and the role religion has to play in modern life, if  only with reference to a single case study.My study is about Aghoreshwar Bhagawan Ram Ji's life, a biography  gleaned from books published by the society he established, but given flesh,  blood and continuity by the stories narrated to me during fieldwork, and by  comparative analysis with practices found in other long-standing traditions of  spirituality in India. It is also about his viewpoints on the nature and subject  of worship, humanism, nationalism, universalism, and an astute manner of  communicating ideas with efficacy. Such a study not only illuminates the rigors  of the life of an Aughaá¹› ascetic, but also gives new insight into the  workings of this tradition, as well as into what being a monk or a saint means  to followers of this tradition in this age of modernity.
