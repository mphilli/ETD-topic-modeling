$ABSTRACT:
This study attempts to provide an interdisciplinary examination through a case study approach of the foregoing questions based on the debates and actions of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention as it dealt with judicial reform. Primary emphasis is placed on the major issues, action and behavior of the convention delegates in regard to the Judiciary Article produced by the convention and submitted to the voters. The primary approach of this case study is a formal, historical explanation of the development  of the judiciary proposal, permitting analysis of the contributions to convention decision-making of the various Delegate Proposals, the subcommittees, the Judiciary Committee, and finally, convention floor action.
