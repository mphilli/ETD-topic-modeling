$ABSTRACT:
This study focuses attention upon the reading and study of [black] literature with the express purpose of gathering and analyzing evidence about adolescent responses to it. An ancillary purpose is to assess the impact of reading this "new" subject matter upon students' racial attitudes. In short, the investigator seeks information about both the cognitive and affective reading responses of high school students to black literature and to the black experiences that it expresses. Such information should prove useful to teachers and curriculum experts who must deal with the problem of making black literature a viable and integrative part of the English program. It should also give some indication about the value of using the vicarious experience of fiction in order to develop positive racial attitudes, attack stereotyped thinking about race, and measure levels of comprehension and modes of response to one aspect of black studies.
