$ABSTRACT:
This study examined how student interns made meaning of their internship experience. Through their narratives, valuable constructs about work they developed through their internship experience and which may not have been ascertained by current performance evaluation tools were made visible. In the words of the student interns, it was possible to gain useful insights into the ways in which they transitioned from academia to the workplace. This study revealed the constructivist processes that facilitated the development of knowledge of the workplace and their perception of whether or not they were prepared for the world of work. Additionally, the research focused on some of the influences of race, gender, and (dis)ability on students' perceptions of IT as a viable career option. Implications for career counseling and internship planning are drawn out.
