$ABSTRACT:
This study used an in-depth textual analysis of the television  show Survivor: Samoa to demonstrate that the unscripted characters of the  program and shows like it have agency within the narrative. In addition to the  19th season of the Survivor series, the sample also included Jeff Probst's (host  and executive producer of the series) weekly blog for EntertainmentWeekly.com.  Unlike most popular television narratives, the unscripted characters of  Survivor: Samoa have the opportunity to tell their own story. This doctoral  project was an in-depth analysis at how that authorial power was shared between  the Producers of the show and the individual characters. The results of indicate  there are three types of narrative agents that contributed to the storytelling  process: the producers, the characters, and then a unique mix of the two. The  result is a new perspective within the academic literature on Survivor and  reality television shows like it. The self-performing characters are the product  of our societal fascination with fame, self-promotion and hyperbolic impression  management.
