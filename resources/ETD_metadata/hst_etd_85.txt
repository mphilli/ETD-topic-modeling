$ABSTRACT:
New York, first to set aside a forest park for its citizens, is today the only state where the idea of a Forest Preserve, to remain inviolate and forever, is embedded within the framework of its Constitution. Present attitudes have roots that can be traced back seventy-five years, and a study of the State's conservation history places us in a better position to understand the present controversies with respect to natural resource policy.
