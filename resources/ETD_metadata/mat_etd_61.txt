Banach algebras, Arens-Hoffman

$ABSTRACT:
In this dissertation, we will refer to any commutative algebra over the complex field which possesses an identity e simply as an algebra...This dissertaion deals primarily with algebraic aspects of the Arens-Hoffman extension of a Banach Algebra A and thus builds upon the work of G. A. Heuer, J.A. Lindberg, and Heuer and Lidberg...
