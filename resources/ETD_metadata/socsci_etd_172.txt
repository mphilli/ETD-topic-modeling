$ABSTRACT:
Much research has been conducted on the differences among people in how  they approach conflict situations. While much attention has been given  to the personalities and resulting frame preferences of conflict  participants, little has been given to the actual practitioners and  theorists themselves. Analysis was conducted on 75 conflict practitioner  interviews in order to explore relationships among personality traits,  gender, location of action (i.e., domestic, international, or general)  and four conflict frames (i.e., dealmaker/orchestrator;  neutrality/equity; transformative/pragmatic; and  associative/dissociative). Gender and primary location of action were  found to be significantly related to two of the four frames, and  conceptual complexity emerged as a key personality trait related to two  of the four frames. Implications for practitioner training programs are  discussed.
