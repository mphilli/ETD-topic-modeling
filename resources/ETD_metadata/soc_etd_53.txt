$ABSTRACT:
In recent years, much research has been done which focused on various aspects of the social phenomenon of prostitution.  At the same time, there has been surprisingly little empirical or theoretical consideration of the broader role of prostitution in Western society.  On this question, Kingsley Davis's functional analysis (1937, 1961) remains the classic and standard sociological reference...In this work, the attempt will be made to explore one of Davis's most important propositions, and in addition, to contribute to the macro-sociological analysis of prostitution by developing and empirically exploring an hypothisis derived from the boundary maintenance theory of deviance.
