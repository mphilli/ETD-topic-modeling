$ABSTRACT:
In order that the science of comparative administration may be able to generate more universal theory, theory with greater legitimacy and relevance, it should extend its inquiries to the area of the Communist world.  Moreover, this body  of theory will become more meaningful if this area is explored from the view point of national development.   The present research study, concerned as it is with the nation-building process and administrative development in North Korea, will try to meet this requirement.
