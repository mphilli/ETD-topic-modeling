$ABSTRACT:
With intensifying pressure to not only solve public problems by  collaborating with actors situated outside the confines of city hall but also to  address complex, long-term challenges like climate change adaptation and  sustainability, local government public managers find themselves working in  increasingly difficult public management environments. Currently, public  management theory fails to fully prescribe management strategies and behaviors  that enable managers to best achieve their goals in these situations. This  dissertation addresses this gap between theory and practice by tracing the  public management processes that lead to outcomes in a set of municipality-led  brownfield remediation and redevelopment projects.Utilizing an integration of public management, policy tool, and  network theories, this research compares four project-level case studies in  Rochester and Buffalo, New York, to address two primary questions. First, in  what ways do brownfield projects function as public management networks? Second,  to what extent do network management behaviors by city-level public managers  impact project outcomes?Contrary to prior research, my findings revealed that neither  relationship management nor policy tool strategies alone sufficiently explained  project outcomes. Instead, effective public management occurred when high levels  of political legitimacy were coupled with an integration of policy tool and  relationship management strategies, either through network-centric public  managers themselves or through the actions of political champions operating in  partnership with them. These findings imply that public management researchers  focusing solely upon relationship management or policy tool explanations  separate from political influences are not fully capturing the true public  management story.
