$ABSTRACT:
This paper is a study of the manner in which the American people undertook to suppress dissent during two great wars, the Civil War and World War I. It is the result of a desire which the writer felt for a greater understanding of the reaction which this nation made during these two periods to the application of intense external pressure. Such pressure cannot fail to bring major changes in the national attitudes and feeling toward such a time-honored concepts as free speech, due process, and indeed the entire gamut of traditional values.
