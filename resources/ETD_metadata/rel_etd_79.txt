$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation explores the current growth of Neopaganism in the  United States. I contend that a key factor in this growth is the  willingness of the Neopagan community to use the Internet for religious  communication and practice. I explore two primary issues in this  dissertation: First, how a religion defined as "nature-based" finds such  expression through technology; second, why the Internet has contributed  so much to the growth of this religious tradition. I argue that  Internet use has become so widespread in this religion because that use  is a natural outcome of Neopagan religious ideas; the Internet is not  simply a means for communication in this religion, but an expression of  the worldview Neopagans hold.
