Enzymic oxidation reactions, Coenzyme, Dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide

$ABSTRACT:
Many important enzymic oxidation reactions which combine various substrates with oxygen in living systems require the presence of the coenzyme, dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). A few examples of such oxidations are aerobic respiration, hydroxylation of aromatic rings, lactonization of ketones, and epoxidation of squalene in the biosynthesis of steroids. The coenzyme is utilized as a source of electrons in these reactions but its precise role has not always been determined.
