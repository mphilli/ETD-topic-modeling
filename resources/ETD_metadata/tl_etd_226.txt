$ABSTRACT:
It is the purpose of this study to focus attention on the beginnings of mathematics instruction by making a comparative analysis of the content (scope and sequence) of elementary school mathematics (arithmetic) textbook programs ordinarily followed by children up to the age of 11 years which are currently (1958-1960) representatives of selected European countries (England, France, German Federal Republic, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) and the United States. The age limit of 11 years was selected on the basis of two criteria: first, it is an accepted fact that all children in each of the five nations being considered follow basically a common instructional program at the elementary level; and second, a "natural break" occurs in the foreign programs at about this point -- beyond which the schools are more "selective" and may in fact be more "exclusive."
