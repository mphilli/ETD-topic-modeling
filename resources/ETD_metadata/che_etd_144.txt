$ABSTRACT:
Iodine and bromine were discovered to be readily added to 1,6-cyclodecadiyne to regioselectively form transannular coupling products 1,5-diiodo-2,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalene and the dibromo derivative respectively. Solvent-incorporation products were observed in the addition of iodine when the reaction was done in benzene, chlorobenzene, or methanol. Silver nitrate-assisted iodination of the cyclodiyne in methanol gave 1-iodo-5-methoxy-2,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthlene as a major product. Acid-catalyzed transannular hydration of the diyne led to a facile formation of 3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalene-1(2H)-one. A cyclic iodonium ion and a vinyl cation were proposed as intermediates in the iodination reaction pathway based on the controlled mechanistic studies. The diyne is also very reactive to 16-electron cationic iron complexes, white the diene diiodide can oxidatively add to tetrakis(triphenyl)palladiun complex.Pentamethylcyclopentadienyl dicarbonyl iron anion Fp$\sp*$K reacted with cis-3,4-dichlorocyclobutene, producing ring-closed compounds, trans-3-chloro-4- (Cp$\sp*$(CO)$\sb2$Fe) -cyclobutene and (Cp$\sp*$(CO)$\sb2$Fe) $\sb2$-($\mu$-trans-3,4-cyclobutenediyl), and ring-opened compounds, (Cp$\sp*$(CO)$\sb2$Fe) -(CH=CH-CH=CCl) and (Cp$\sp*$(CO)$\sb2$Fe) $\sb2$-($\mu$-CH=CH-CH=CH), each isolated independently under different conditions. The closed-ring complexes underwent electrocyclic ring opening reactions to form the ring-opened complexes in quantitative yields. Photochemical reactions of (Cp$\sp*$(CO)$\sb2$Fe) $\sb2$-($\mu$-CH=CH-CH=CH) with $\eta\sp2$-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane produced the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl butadiene-bridged diiron complex (Cp$\sp*$($\eta\sp2$-dppe)Fe) $\sb2$-($\mu$-CH=CH-CH=CH), which was characterized in its three oxidation state (neutral, cation, and dication). The X-ray structure of the neutral form was also determined.The cyclic voltammogram of (Cp$\sp*(\eta\sp2$-dppe)Fe) $\sb2$-($\mu$-CH=CH-CH=CH) showed two single-electron reversible oxidation waves separated by 0.60 V. A large comproportionation constant ($1.42\times10\sp{10}$) was determined for the formation of radical cation complex ($\{$Cp$\sp*(\eta$-dppe)Fe$\}\sb2$-($\mu$ -CH=CH-CH=CH)) (PF$\sb6$). Mossbauer spectra characterize the radical cation and dication complex ($\{$Cp$\sp*(\eta\sp2$-dppe)Fe$\}\sb2$-($ \mu$-CH=CH-CH=CH)) (PF$\sb6\rbrack\sb2$ as isovalent complexes. Electronic spectra of the radical cation showed a narrow band at 505 nm from metal-ligand charge transfer and a strong broad solvent-independent band at 1427 nm assigned as an "intervalence transition", characteristic of mixed-valence complexes. The radical cation is classified as a nontrapped delocalized Robin-Day Class III mixed-valence complex with an effective coupling parameter, V$\rm\sb{ab}$ = 0.43 eV.Instead of forming the expected $\mu$-$\rm C\sb2H\sb2$ olefin-bridged heterodinuclear complexes, reactions of iron acetylide Cp$\sp*$(dppe)Fe-C$\equiv$CH with hydrozirconium chloride, diisobutyl-aluminum hydride, and catecholborane led to the formation of C$\sb2$-bridged complexes Cp$\sp*$(dppe)Fe-C$\equiv$C-ZrClCp$\sb2$, Cp$\sp*$(dppe)Fe-C$\equiv$CAl$\rm\sp{i}$Bu$\sb2$, and Cp$\sp*$(dppe)Fe-C$\equiv$C-Bcat, respectively in high yields with the release of hydrogen gas as a by-product. A two-electron three-center mechanism is proposed for these reactions. Reaction of the iron acetylide with dimethylaminotrimethyltin gave the condensed product Cp$\sp*$(dppe)Fe-C$\equiv$C-SnMe$\sb3$ in quantitative yield.
