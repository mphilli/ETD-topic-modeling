$ABSTRACT:
This study is primarily concerned with the theoretical investigation of microwave cavities containing anisotropic media ... An anisotropic medium in general is one characterized by a tensor permitivity and a tensor permeability, which may be asymetric... A major portion of this work is devoted to the calculation of the resonances of a rectangular cavity filled with anisotropic plasmas.
