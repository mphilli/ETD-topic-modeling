$ABSTRACT:
In this dissertation, I examine the ways in which Taiwan's  culture and society was represented in and through the work in Taiwan of the  Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association (OSMA), a nonprofit service organization  that sent selected Oberlin College graduates to Tunghai University to teach  English and engage in intercultural exchange through international service. I  analyze from a rhetorical perspective the texts used in establishing, running,  and closing down this program, which lasted from 1955 to 1979. Drawing on a wide  variety of texts from the OSMA archives, I explain the ways in which  deliberations regarding the OSMA's program at Tunghai were grounded in  overlapping and sometimes competing rhetorics of Oberlin's historical  relationship with China. As a result of the changing attitudes of Oberlin  students toward US involvement in Asia, the tradition of service to Asia that  characterized the OSMA was challenged, resulting in conflicting rhetorics about  OSMA's identity and mission. The dissertation thus contributes an historical  perspective to current research on the geopolitics of service learning. It also  contributes to studies of organization communication through its focus on the  rhetorical ecology of a nonprofit service organization over a 25-year period,  particularly in the ways that particular genres were employed in material and  social contexts.
