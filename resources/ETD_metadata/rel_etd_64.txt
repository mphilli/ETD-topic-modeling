$ABSTRACT:
Notions about the nature and operation of causality are integral to interpretations of reality, be these interpretations scientific or religious. Articulated or not, they are part of every world view, implicit in every enterprise. Whether once's purpose is explanation, prediction, control, revolution, therapy or libration, such notions of causality inhere in perceptions of the orderliness of life, of how things come to be the way they are, how they change and can be changed.  ...The Buddha's teaching of causality presents a radical contrast with other views of his time in India. Indeed, it departed from previous causal notions as much as general systems view of causality does from the traditional Western thought. ...Our project in this dissertation is to examine mutual causality and its implications using the perspectives of general systems theory and early Buddhist teachings.
