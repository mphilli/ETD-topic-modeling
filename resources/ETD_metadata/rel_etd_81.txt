$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation  argues for a performative and responsive understanding of philosophical  and theological truth. Whereas truth is typically treated in overly  theoretical terms in these disciplines--limited to the formulation of  statements, propositions, or systems--I argue for its integral  relationship with practices and traditions. Specifically, it stages a  dialogue between recent continental philosophers (especially SÃ¸ren  Kierkegaard and Jacques Derrida) and late ancient academic theologians  (particularly Origen of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa).Part  1 examines this shift in thinking about truth in a number of ancient,  late ancient, and recent continental figures by focusing on the  interaction between idiom, idea, and performance in their texts. Part 2  considers the interpretive and disciplinary regimes (specifically late  ancient orthodoxy and the modern research university) that often limit  or inhibit the active and relational understanding of truth in religious  discourse. Part 3 crosses the recent with the late ancient (reading  Kierkegaard in light of ancient academic practice) and the late ancient  with the recent (reading Gregory in light of Derrida) so as to draw out  the constructive implications of this transformation of truth.Characterizing  truth as an ongoing response to others, traditions, and situations  serves to challenge reductive readings of continental philosophers as  nihilistic theorists and late ancient academics as other-worldly  metaphysicians. Instead of holding these largely negative or disembodied  positions, I argue that these figures and their texts transform the  tasks of philosophy and theology. Exercising capabilities and  transforming the ways that we look at our inheritance and surrounding  world, this form of thinking serves to open alternative ways of living,  relating, and acting.
