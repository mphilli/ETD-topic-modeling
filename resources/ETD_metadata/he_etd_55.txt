$ABSTRACT:
The primary purpose of the present study is to examine the life and career of Harvey Backus Wilbur (1820-1883). By examining Wilbur's life and career, it is hypothesized that the major issues, the key service principles and the important relationships of the early service leaders will be identified. From its initiation, the primary purpose of this study has been biographical in nature rather than an attempt to conduct a full social history and analysis of 19th century institutions.
