$ABSTRACT:
Recent interest in the study of local-level politics in Africa can be traced to three major sources: 1) the descriptive works of the British social anthropologists; 2) the effort stimulated by the Committee on Comparative Politics of the Social Science Research Council to conceptualize the process of political development; and 3) the power-structure literature of political science and sociology.
