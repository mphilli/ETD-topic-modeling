$ABSTRACT:
The basic proposal of this dissertation is to contribute to a better understanding of the artistic value of the narrative prose of Rubén Darío. It focuses on Azul as an inaugural work in Latinamerican literature, and also partially focuses on the prolific and definitive modernist era of Buenos Aires between 1893-1898. One of the fundamental objectives of this dissertation is to examine, the constructive principles of textual productivity in the narrative of Rubén Darío. In accord with this objective, Darian text is analyzed as self-reflective discourse, a written practice that takes into account its own process of writing, whose central mimesis  does not imitate an adventure, but rather to look at the writing itself. All of the trangressions of Azul as a rupture-text had its productivity in mind. It is for this reason that the analyses of Darian discourse included in this dissertation emphasize the construction of a discourse that reflects on its own writing process, on its disarticulations and accumulations, its creation of imprecise, fleeting imagery and a fragmented vision of its own images.Additional objectives of this dissertation are to interpret these discursive elaborations and illuminate them against the backdrop of a modernist sociocultural context, to examine the specific, unique characteristics of this period's narrative, and to discover its meaning in relation to the sociocultural modernist panorama. For this it becomes necessary to determine the relationship of the tension that exists between these textual structures and the dominant cultural vision, the connections between the concrete literary text and the social code. A reflection is developed on the semantic prominence that the narrative structures evoke in the textual productivity of Darío's short stories. Finally, the work explores how these constructive priniciples each contributes at the thematic level to the persistent search for the new, the unique, the strange, all of which are characteristics of Darío's writings, and those of the other modernists.
