$ABSTRACT:
There are many new and creative techniques which encourage students to explore and to be receptive to their learning experience. Many of these methods rely upon the students' resource and require a positive self-image. Educational literature suggests that self-concept is an important factor in any learning situation and is directly related to the child's receptiveness to knowledge and his learning capacity in general.
