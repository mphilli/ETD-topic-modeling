$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is a study of the political influence of Joseph Ellicott in western New York from 1800 to 1821, the period during which he served as Resident-Agent of the Holland Land Company. It traces the evolution of political institutions in this area, and analyzes the political activities of Ellicott in the development of roads, the building of the Grand Canal, the War of 1812, and the establishment of the Bank of Niagara. It also examines the extent of Ellicott's powers to determine whether he was the "political boss" of the region; it evaluates, too, how wisely he used his political influence. I have been concerned with social and economic aspects of life in western New York only as they help to explain Ellicott's political motivations and conduct. Similarly, biographical material has been included where it has bearing on the interpretation of political maneuvers, and not for its intrinsic value.
