$ABSTRACT:
This study is an effort to shed light on romantic relationship satisfaction in adulthood in relation to family of origin experiences and educational attainment. Thus far, researchers have shown a positive correlation between adulthood relationship satisfaction and family of origin experiences in childhood. Furthermore, educational attainment seems to have important life long benefits and protective factors for individuals. However, there is a lack of knowledge in the literature as to how well these two variables can predict romantic relationship satisfaction together. In this cross-sectional research study, the researcher tested the hypothesis that educational attainment and positive family of origin experiences may predict romantic relationship satisfaction. Participants were recruited from clients who are currently seeking therapy services at Syracuse Universityâ€™s Couple and Family Therapy Center. Regression analysis on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) showed that family of origin experiences and educational attainment do not predict romantic relationship satisfaction in this sample. Implication of this result and future research ideas are discussed.
