$ABSTRACT:
To best promote generalization, specific programming strategies must be  implemented (Stokes & Baer, 1977). Attempts at generalizing oral  reading fluency in the past have yielded mixed results. Using a  between-subjects group design, the current study compared an  intervention that directly reinforced the act of generalization  (Generalized Training condition) with an intervention that incorporated  the generally accepted method of repeatedly reading a passage (Repeated  Reading condition) for their effects on generalized oral reading fluency  gains. These two interventions were also compared to a third, control  condition. Thirty-seven second and third grade students reading below  grade level participated. Results indicated that at post-test, students'  fluency in both the Generalized Training condition and the Repeated  Reading condition significantly improved over both pre-test and fluency  levels achieved by students in the control condition. Implications for  effectively generalizing oral reading fluency are discussed.
