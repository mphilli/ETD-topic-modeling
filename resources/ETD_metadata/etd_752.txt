$ABSTRACT:
This research was performed to investigate public participation in highly technical policyscenarios and the outcomes of this participation. A detailed evaluation of communityinvolvement at Superfund sites (via the Technical Assistance Grant, or TAG, Program) wasperformed by researching a specific type of complex, highly-technical policy problem, using amixed methods approach, incorporating a quantitative econometric evaluation and qualitativemultiple case study of selected Superfund sites.The existing literature on public participation argues that citizen involvement is central todemocratic decision-making and is an important part of the policy process. This study wasrooted in a series of research questions about public participation in technical settings. Thesequestions addressed the attributes of successful participation, the characteristics of technicalpolicy issues that could lead to gaps in successful participation, the expected impact of theSuperfund TAG program in addressing these gaps, and questions about the specific impacts ofthe TAG program at Superfund sites on outcomes (schedule, remedy selected, and communityperceptions and satisfaction with the outcomes).The Superfund program has the hallmark characteristics of a highly technical, complexpolicy situation â€“ it is characterized by technical complexity, solutions to the problems areexpensive, public involvement is expensive, the process is slow, and the technical partiestypically have better access to information than does the public. The quantitative research hereinidentified several drivers for obtaining a TAG and demonstrated the impact of a TAG onschedule and remedy. The case studies provided support for the expectations about barriers topublic participation in complex, technical settings, and expectations about the ability of theTAG program to address some of the participation gaps. The research also identified areas forpublic participation improvement, through providing independent technical advisors, support forestablishment of community networks, support for citizen advocates, and agency support forcapacity building.
