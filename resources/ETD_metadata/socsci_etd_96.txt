$DEPARTMENT:
Sociology

$KEYWORDS:
Onondaga Iroquios, archaeology

$ABSTRACT:
Two considerations led to this study.  First was a desire to better understand events n northeastern North America during the sixteenth century; that formative yet enigmatic phase of European-native relations.  Second was the need to get beyond the conceptual roadblock of "The Iroquois" and their league.  To explore these questions, a particular native group, the ONondage Iroquois, is examined as well as how their culture changed as a consequence of European contact.
