$DEPARTMENT:

$KEYWORDS:
Human knowledge, Critical relational model, Family therapy

$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation will present and develop a normative and meta-theoretical model. Through the aforementioned meta-theoretical and normative stance I will present a critical analytical model from which human knowledge, existence, and behavior can be understood and expanded. The first sections of this paper will provide a detailed explanation and evaluation of the theoretical model. In those following, I will convey how this model applies to the evolution of Bowen Theory and family therapy theories across time.
