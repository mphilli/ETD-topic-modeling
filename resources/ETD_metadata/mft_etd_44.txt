$ABSTRACT:
Although it is commonly acknowledged that homophobia and racial  marginalization influence queer African American male youth, there is very  little research to back up this belief. Due to the paucity of information for  clinicians, families, and communities on the relational dynamics of queer  African American male youth and their parents, queer African American male youth  were interviewed to explore the ways in which they understand their experience  of the disclosure process, paying particular attention to the interface between  race and sexual orientation and relational dynamics. This exploratory,  qualitative study examined data gathered in interviews with individual male  youth that identified themselves as African American and queer. Eleven  participants were interviewed in semi-structured interviews for the purpose of  exploring participant's experience of the disclosure process with specific  emphasis on their racial identity. Data analysis revealed essential structures  which underlay the interpersonal and intrapersonal disclosure experience. In  addition, a preliminary stage model, including pre-disclosure, disclosure and  experience after disclosure was found. Implications for clinicians working with  queer, African American male youth and their families are discussed as are  suggestions for future research.
