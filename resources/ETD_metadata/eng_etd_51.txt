Reynolds and Wordsworth on Imagination: A Comparative Study

$DEPARTMENT:
English

$KEYWORDS:
Imagination, Reason, Nature, Sublime, Aesthetic thought, Romanticism, Neoclassicism

$ABSTRACT:
This is primarily a comparative study of Reynolds' and Wordsworth's ideas on imagination, especially as these ideas are related to concepts of reason, nature and the sublime. It entails some differences, as one would expect; but also there are some unsuspected similarities. Consequently, this study has the further purpose of analyzing part of the changing phase in the history of aesthetic thought, by showing how the differences and similarities of the comparison often cut across the normally conceived opposition of Romanticism and Neoclassicism.
