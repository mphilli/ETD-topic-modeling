$ABSTRACT:
The issue that this study addressed was the unprivileged status of women audience members and women directors in the male dominated Chinese film industry. To investigate this problem, the purpose of this study was to explore how Chinese women audience members produce different meanings in terms of gender identity and gender relations through viewing The Golden Era (2014), directed by a female filmmaker Ann Hui. To deeply understand the viewing experiences of Chinese women audience members, this qualitative research project was designed as a reception analysis. To gather data, interviews with 18 Chinese women with viewing experiences of this film were collected from December 2014 to January 2015. The transcribed interviews were translated and analyzed. Under the framework of feminist cultural studies, the portrayal of gender roles and gender relations in this film incited various reactions and reading practices of Chinese audience members throughout these data. Through feminist standpoint theory, these findings were useful for subtly recognizing how Chinese women's multiple reading practices problematize and complicate the oppressor/oppressed binary of the power relations in terms of gender.
