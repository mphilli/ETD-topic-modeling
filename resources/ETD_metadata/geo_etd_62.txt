$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is an investigation of the nature and spatial organization of society in Philippine provincial cities. It seeks to ascertain what groups and classes are present in these cities, and how they have changed over time. The central perspective is a concern for social-spatial patterns: for uniformity and heterogeneity, broad ecological frames, and fine grained patterns of social coherence. A wide variety of social and economic information is also analyzed.
