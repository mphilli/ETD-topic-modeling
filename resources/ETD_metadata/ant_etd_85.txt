$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation project uses archaeological and historical  information to examine the cultural dynamics of maple syrup making at Fort Drum,  New York, in the period between 1880 and 1940. This project combines a  processual approach with an interpretive assessment, covering the social,  economic and cultural contexts in which maple syrup was made at Fort Drum during  the project research period. The project was intended, first, to expand the  scope and analytical depth of an existing cultural resources management project  that had proposed two size categories of maple syrup processing site among the  41 sites of this type known at Fort Drum as of 2004. The archaeological data  generated by this dissertation project indicate that, instead of being divided  into discrete categories based upon site size, four of the six sites tested in  2004 were rebuilt, improved, and gradually expanded through the study period,  with much of this expansion taking place between 1900 and 1940. This observation  points toward a far more nuanced and interactive process of change taking place  in the region's maple syrup industry. Explaining and interpreting this process  of change makes use of data about maple syrup making and dairy farming, the  other farming operation pursued by most New York and Fort Drum maple syrup  makers, derived from secondary and primary documents, principally, discussion of  these two industries in "The Rural New Yorker," a farmer's journal covering the  northeastern United States between 1878 and 1964. This information allowed  advancement of an alternative hypothesis which explains gradual development of  the Fort Drum maple syrup processing sites, and which also places maple syrup  making within the broader economic, geographic, social and cultural contexts of  which syrup making was a part. This project demonstrates the value of detailed  and in-depth study of cultural context in archaeological explanation and in  historical archaeology.
