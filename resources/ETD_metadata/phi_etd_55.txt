$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this essay is to discuss a problem not of philosophy in general, but of the philosophy of religion. The subject is limited to one major problem in the field of the philosophy of religion, the problem of the relation of reason and faith. The problem of the relation of faith and reason, however, is to be considered in the writings of only one man, St. Augustine of Hippo.
