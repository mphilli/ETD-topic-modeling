An Essay on the Ontology of Reasons

$DEPARTMENT:

$KEYWORDS:
Motivating Reasons, Anti-Psychologism, Psychologism, Propositionalism

$ABSTRACT:
I argue that many recent anti-psychologistic accounts of agential reasons are unsatisfactory. I also argue that psychologistic accounts are false. Then I develop and defend an anti-psychologistic, propositionalist theory of reasons whereby agential reasons are propositions. I also develop a corresponding anti-psychologistic account of reason-explanation that is able to help resolve some of the more difficult problems for theories of anti-psychologism. Next, I argue for a Russellian theory of propositionalism. Finally, I argue against teleological theories of reasons.
