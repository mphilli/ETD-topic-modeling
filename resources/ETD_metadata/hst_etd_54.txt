$ABSTRACT:
This is a study roughly of the second and third periods of the Greek experiences in Ethiopia. In the eighteenth century the Greeks resumed a tradition of intimate involvement with Ethiopia which had been interrupted for a thousand years. They maintained both a physical presence in the country and a close contact with Ethiopian affairs from abroad. The Hellenic factor primarily affected economic and political life, but also had important ramifications in religious affairs. The Greeks never enjoyed a large population in Ethiopia, but their impact in proportion to their numbers was significant.
