Computer science, graphics, computer-aided curve and surface design, Bezier curves, data smoothing problems

$ABSTRACT:
The central problem that this thesis addresses is the problem of interactively designing free-form curves and surfaces on a computer graphics display. With slight variations, the same methods may be used for a broad class of data fitting and data smoothing problems.
