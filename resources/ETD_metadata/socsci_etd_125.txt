$ABSTRACT:
Gerard served as Wilson's Ambassador at Berlin from late 1913 through the break in German-American relations in early February 1917. In several respects he was a historical anomaly. Born and raised among the high minded families of old New York City, he married into the nouveau riche founded in western mineral wealth. Schooled in pragmatism by his father and Nicholas Murray Butler, he practiced law, gallivanted with the lustrous crowd of New York, Saratoga, and Newport, caballed in urban politics, and won himself a Tammany sponsored seat on his state's high court. A life long Democrat and generous contributor to campaign finances, he mustered every available avenue of influence to secure his ambassadorial appointment from the new progressive President.
