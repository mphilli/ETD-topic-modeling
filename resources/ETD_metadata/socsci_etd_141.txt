$ABSTRACT:
The scope of this study encompasses the period from Seward's adolescence through the critical year, 1850, at which time Seward emerged as a truly national figure. The emphasis is on those background factors and actions which serve to earn for Seward the well-deserved designation, "reformer", especially in the anti-slavery movement, and regarding the New York City school issue.--Preface.
