$ABSTRACT:
Research has shown that early childhood teachers who have more education  are able to provide young children with additional learning experiences  in the preschool classroom. Proponents of early childhood teacher  preparation programs support the notion that teachers with advanced  degrees are more prepared than teachers with no degrees. The purpose of  this study was to evaluate teachers' perceptions regarding their early  childhood teacher preparation programs and to see if there are any  relationships that exist between their perceptions and competency. The  study also looked at how teachers' perceptions vary as a result of their  preparation program. The participants were 86 early childhood teachers.  Results indicated a discrepancy with the research literature stating  that the more educational training one has teachers' competency  increases. The research literature and directions for future research  are discussed.
