$ABSTRACT:
This study examines how leaders of transnational NGOs (TNGOs)  across the United States understand transnational activism and the roles their  organizations play in world affairs. Three roles are identified: alleviation,  realization and environmentalism. Analysis suggests that scholarship in  international relations focuses disproportionately on the least common and least  resourceful types of TNGOs and routinely mischaracterizes a small number of  highly visible organizations as exemplary. Leaders' perspectives on  organizational mission, activities, autonomy, collaboration, effectiveness and  obstacles reveal that the most numerous and resourceful TNGOs are technocratic  agencies favoring a materialistic, ameliorative approach to transnational  activism. Moreover, to the extent that TNGOs exercise ideational power to  achieve sociopolitical change, this power more closely resembles technocratic  managerialism than overt political contention. Insights are derived from a  mixed-method analysis of over 200 hours of in-depth interviews with top leaders  from a diverse sample of 152 TNGOs registered in the United States.
