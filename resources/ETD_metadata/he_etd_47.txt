$ABSTRACT:
Two polar opposite trends, the rapid expansion of American higher education during the decade of the Sixties and its retrenchment during the Seventies, have stimulated the growth and development of cooperative efforts among colleges and universities. One form, the voluntary, multipurpose consortium, has emerged as a growing format and vehicle for inter-institutional cooperation. In the forty-year period between 1925 and 1965, nineteen consortia were founded in the United States. In contrast, eighty-seven new consortia were formed during the ten-year period between 1965 and 1975. It should be noted that although several consortia disbanded during this period, the trend in recent years has been unmistakenly in the direction of increased rates of consortium formation.
