$ABSTRACT:
The purpose of the present work was threefold: (1) to examine the  perceptions of what makes retail recruiting organizations attractive to college  undergraduates and examine what attributes recruiting organizations believe  students are attracted to; (2) to examine the differences in these perceptions  with particular interest in the role of the recruiters themselves and (3) to  test whether specific recruitment attributes, ranked highly by the students,  impacted variables already cited in the extant literature, in order to assist  human resources professionals increase the effectiveness of their recruitment  practices.In the fall of 2008, four in-depth interviews with key retail  recruiters, and a focus group with six senior retail undergraduate students were  held. The following spring a Q-study was administered to eight recruiters and  nineteen students utilizing the data collected from the focus group and  interviews. In fall of 2010 and early 2011, three conjoint analysis experiments  were conducted to measure the impact of specific recruiter behaviors identified  by the students as being of key importance to their attraction, upon the  variables of personableness, informativeness and competence, widely cited as  being of significance to applicant attraction in the recruitment literature. An  additional experiment was conducted to measure the impact of these behaviors on  likelihood to pursue an opportunity with this organization. The specific  recruitment behaviors were summarized as structured interview format,  relationship with student, and sustained presence on campus.Findings indicated that college undergraduates and recruitment  professionals differ significantly in what they believe is of importance in  attracting student applicants to organizations and the conjoint analysis  experiments showed a strong influence by the identified recruitment behaviors on  two of the variables from the extant literature.
