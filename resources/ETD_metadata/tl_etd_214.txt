$ABSTRACT:
Despite the many resources available to nurses today, many do not continue their professional development through continuing education.800 nurses in four upstate New York counties were sent a modified version of the Scanlan Deterrents to Participation Scale. The research questions included: identifying personal learning efforts most frequently used and factors underlying those efforts, the relationship between personal learning efforts and reasons for not participating, and the influence of job satisfaction on participation.Through the 44% return, we realize that there are factors which influence participation. The factors include Marginallity, Inadequacy, Subordinancy, Costliness, Incompatibility and Competency. The research showed that nurses in the particular four county region identified themselves as professionals, yet education was not their first priority in life. They want their continuing educational experience relevant to their work, available and convenient.
