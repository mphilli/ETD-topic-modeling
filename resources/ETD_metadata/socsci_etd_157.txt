$ABSTRACT:
So far as I have been able to determine, no person has yet to set down a complete account of the rise from obscurity and passage into oblivion of the political party which, for a time, made New York the scene of its hustings.  I have essayed to describe that political venture.Born of expediency, fraught with dissension, bolstered and betrayed by egoism, peopled with an entire spectrum of politcal advocacies, and finally, isolated and discredited, the American Labor Party was both prodigy and prodigal during its lifetime.
