$ABSTRACT:
The relationship between ethnicity, race, and gender and the educational  attainment of Latina/o students in the United States is investigated  using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988  (NELS:88). The analysis indicates that ethnicity plays a role in on-time  high school graduation and entrance to a four-year college. In  addition, the results show that race and gender patterns of attainment  operate differently across Latina/o ethnic groups. The findings also  illustrate how several social factors (i.e., advanced placement course  participation, student aspirations) improve Latina/o student educational  attainment and, in some instances, even reduce or eliminate ethnicity,  race, and gender gaps in attainment.
