$ABSTRACT:
Twenty-six work-bound, college-able, rural high school seniors were interviewed regarding their aspirations for the future beyond high school, their views of the transition from high school to work, and the processes by which they came to think of themselves as work-bound. The influence of family and perceptions of adulthood and the real world predominated, and perspectives of school, learning, and work were presented in the students' words. Recommendations were made for school personnel, particularly counselors, to address high school students' career development needs from a contextual perspective, affirming the confluence of relational and vocational identity issues within the context of the students' families, schools, and communities.
