$ABSTRACT:
The research problem  under investigation in this ethnographic case study was to understand  how participants in a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program  realized their support and commitment to it as well as to better  understand its complications and drawbacks in support of a local,  sustainable, civic agriculture. The program is situated in the larger  network of food movements. The explicit purpose of this study was to  increase the likelihood of this program's long-term viability by  understanding both what motivated as well as discouraged participation.  The burgeoning theoretical field of civic agriculture informed this  research.In-depth interviews were  conducted with 69 participants, including current and former CSA members  as well as people with similar interests in local food but not  participating in a CSA. Supporting research methods included participant  observation, survey and archival research. Interview data was  transcribed and coded multiple times using Nvivo qualitative software.  Analysis and interpretation of the findings were organized into three  thematic chapters that included: motivations and implications for  participation, the impact of political beliefs and actions on the  program and a range of participants as well as their suggestions for  program sustainability.The research  realized that social and political values are enacted through  participation and that these provide both opportunities and challenges  for retention and additional enrollment. Further, CSA's structure in a  rapidly changing local food market has reached a tipping point in its  usefulness to its ongoing sustainability where adjustments could be  useful for future growth. Suggestions included restructuring the  program's outreach to include additional choices and options for  participation beyond CSA's traditional subscription program, considering  options for engaging a wider audience regardless of political  motivation, and to realize a regional structure that engages multiple  farms and CSA programs under a larger umbrella in order to realize  economies of scale while continuing to respect the tenets of a local and  civic agriculture.Key words: Community  Supported Agriculture, CSA, civic agriculture, local agriculture, local  food, politics of consumption, food politics.
