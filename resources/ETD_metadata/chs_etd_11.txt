$ABSTRACT:
Using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), this study was aimed at understanding how trait personality differences between supervisors and supervisees on Openness and Conscientiousness scales affected the supervisors' recollection of what happened during supervision as measured by, respectively, the Sensing/Intuition and Judging/Perceiving scales of the Focus of Supervision Form (FSF). Based on previous research regarding gender differences in supervision, the study also sought to determine if supervisors' focus during supervision followed male supervisees' personality profile. Finally, a determination of the predictors of supervisors' focus on both Sensing/Intuition and Judging/Perceiving type learning activities was sought. The participants included 78 supervisor-supervisee dyads, which consisted of 78 master's level students enrolled in counseling practicum classes from nine different counselor education programs and 23 clinical supervisors who provided individual clinical supervision for those practicum students. Designed primarily as a descriptive study, data were collected at three points during the academic semester. The NEO PI-R was administered to the supervisory dyads at the beginning of the semester and the FSF, developed specifically for this study, was administered to supervisors at both the middle and end of the semester. Results indicated that: (1) when there were personality differences between supervisors and supervisees on Openness, the majority of the supervisors tended to recall their focus of supervision to be on more Intuition type learning activities; (2) when there were personality differences between supervisors and supervisees on Conscientiousness, the majority of the supervisors tended to recall their focus of supervision to be on more Perceiving type learning activities; (3) irrespective of gender differences or personality differences on Openness and Conscientiousness, the majority of the supervisors tended to recall their focus of supervision to be on more Intuition and Perceiving type learning activities respectively; and (4) supervisee Openness predicted supervisor Judging focus and supervisee Conscientiousness predicted supervisor Perceiving focus in supervision. In light of findings overall, it would appear that supervision is primarily a process that favors Intuition and Perceiving type learning activities. Additional research is needed to further validate this conclusion.
