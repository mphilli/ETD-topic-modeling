$ABSTRACT:
This study is the group biography of a community in colonial New York formed by the patronage and through the encouragement of Sir William Johnson, Baronet. Johnson was a military hero of the French and Indian War and British Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Although there are three biographies of him, each centers on Johnson to the exclusion of the community he created in the Mohawk Valley. Johnson captured the imagination of his contemporaries, and apparently of his biographers, as a diplomat and soldier. As a result, Johnson springs before us as an extraordinary, atypical figure who remained in his forest domain strangely aloof from the provincial world of which he was a part.
