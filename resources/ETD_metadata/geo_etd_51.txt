Three Miles from L.A. And New York: A Study of Intrametropolitan Office Location Near Chicago - O'Hare International Airport

$ABSTRACT:
This study was prompted by interest in transportation planning assumptions and by curiosity about a particular event. The addition of large numbers of offices in the immediate vicinity of Chicago-O'Hare International Airport is an event that does not fit the usual perceptions about office location; the area is noisy and polluted, lacks the amenities of many other suburban locations, and does not provide the advantages of the typical central business district. Yet airports, like highways and rapid transit lines, provide accessibility. The principle that transportation facilities shape urban development by satisfying linkages through accessibility is part of the accepted framework of ground transportation planning. Can the O'Hare situation be explained as the response of offices with strong linkages outside the metropolitan area to the accessibility O'Hare provides?
