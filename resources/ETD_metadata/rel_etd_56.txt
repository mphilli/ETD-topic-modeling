$ABSTRACT:
Out of an inner awareness of movement oscillating between rational thought and poetic image, we find a new man. Transformation of consciousness characterizes the movement discernible in Bachelard's writings betwen a scientific way of knowing and a poetic way of imagining. Bachelard speaks two different languages. Both languages are symbolic in that they distort the immediate reality of the senses.--Preface.
