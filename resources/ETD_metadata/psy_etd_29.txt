$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation is an examination of the interviews of practitioners and teacher-practitioners who draw from diverse traditions in their counseling practice. Specifically, it focuses on those who integrate conventional counseling practice with approaches broadly described as complementary, healing traditions developed originally out of nonindustrialized cultures. Hermeneutics is applied as a framework to understand the data generated as well as a model with which to interpret across traditions. In keeping with this hermeneutical model, the themes generated from the analysis of interviews are applied in the context of a dialogue. This application seeks to test some of the themes generated by the analysis of the data within the context of contemporary ego psychology, a differing, yet related tradition. Implications for counseling theory and practice, especially in the context of diverse traditions, are drawn from the data analysis and from the application process.
