$ABSTRACT:
This research is a grounded theory study of the Indian Diaspora in the online, immersive, virtual world  Second Life.  Through field study and observation, participant observation, and interviews with   Second Life  residents - animated avatars designed and operated by people in real  life - involved with Indian-themed places and groups, this research  explored the following questions: To what extent does Indian culture in   Second Life  reflect Indian Diaspora culture in real life? To what extent do Indian avatars' experiences of settlement in   Second Life  resemble the acculturation process experienced by Indian immigrants to  the United States? Central themes discovered in the study were the  complex issues faced by avatars in balancing traditional and modern  Indian values, and the expansion of the Indian Diaspora in this  environment to include non-Indian avatars richly enmeshed in Indian  cultural and social life in   Second Life.  Emerging from the results of this study are proposed key factors of virtual diasporas.
