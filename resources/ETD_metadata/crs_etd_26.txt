$ABSTRACT:
The relationship between word and tone constitutes one of the most significant issues in musical aesthetics. Over the years various authors have attempted to classify the widely-differing varieties of relationship found between word and tone in texted compositions throughout the course of Western musical history. For exmaple, Anna Amalie Abert refers to the existence of "musikbetonte" ("musical-dominated") and "textbetonte Epochen" ("text-dominated epochs").
