$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation will present a partial analysis of the history, religious tradition and change, social life, and political status of the Bene Israel. The other two communities will be described only insofar as their activities have influenced the cultural evolution of the Bene Israel. Narrowing the focus even further, this is a description of the Bene Israel in Bombay. Although there are smaller communities of Bene Israel outside Bombay, they have been omitted because they are not representative of the community. In both New Delhi and Poona, this author was told that to understand what has happened to the Bene Israel, he must study in Bombay.
