$ABSTRACT:
This dissertation explores the issue of whether, and if so at what points, one American political party was more isolationist (versus internationalist) than the other, in the era 1918-1933. This includes not only politico-military matters directly connected with international peace, but also socio-economic problems, as viewed by the Republicans and the Democrats, both nationally and regionally.
