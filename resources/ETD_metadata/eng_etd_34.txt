$ABSTRACT:
This study examines American homosexual literature, 1900-1913, to uncover a multiplicity of discourses seeking to define homosexuality. The models of Natural, Unnatural, Domestic, Alien, Athletic, and Aesthetic homosexualities reveal gay writing as inchoate and in a state of flux, where no single discourse ultimately proves sufficient. The study concludes that such (often conflicting) models of gayness persist to the present day. The methodology covers a deliberately wide range of canonical to minor authors and a cross-spectrum of traditional and non-traditional texts, with the additional purpose of recovering gay-inflected writing not currently in circulation among today's critics.
