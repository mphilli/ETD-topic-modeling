$ABSTRACT:
In response to the problem of lower standardized test scores and higher rates of reported problem behaviors among African American students as compared with white students, a team of family therapists was hired by an elementary school to serve as school consultants. This exploratory, qualitative study, guided by the grounded theory method of analysis, examined data gathered in association with the consultation to explore the nature of the identified problem, the response of the school system to the consultation, and, the implications of the findings. Data analysis revealed that devaluation, loss, and rage underlay the school-related difficulties of African American students. The analysis also demonstrated that administrators, teachers/staff, and parents perceived the consultation as resulting in some positive changes and some negative changes, as well as in no change, which also was considered negative. Implications for theory and intervention are provided.
