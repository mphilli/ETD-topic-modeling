$ABSTRACT:
This study is a geographical analysis of modernization in Kenya, an attempt to provide a detailed description of areal variations in the extent of transition from traditional to more modern forms of social, economic, and political organization and behavior. In a broader context, it is also an examination of the growth of an African nation as a spatial phenomena. It seeks to understand and interpret the complex interplay of forces which has shaped the human geography of a portion of east Africa  and led to the emergence of a distinct entity called Kenya.
